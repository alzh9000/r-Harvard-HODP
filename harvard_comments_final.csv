0,"the college and graduate schools of the university are **much** more expensive than hes. currently, an hes undergraduate degree in totality [costs $58,880,](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/bachelor-liberal-arts-degree) with a graduate degree costing [$34,080.](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/registration-admissions) compared to the **annual** [$46,340 tuition](https://www.harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance) of the college (before room and board, total annual costs coming to $67,580), or the annual [$73,440 tuition](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/financial-aid/tuition-assistance/pages/cost-of-attendance.aspx) at hbs (before housing and other expenses), hes is a vastly cheaper program than any other undergraduate or graduate degree from the university.

there are expenses such as housing and meals that aren't factored into the price of hes, of course, but compared to the $273,320 it costs to complete a degree at the college, or the $222,204 that an mba will cost you (housing and fees included per the link provided above), it would be alarming for an hes student to spend as much for their degree as someone at one of the aforementioned schools."
1,"but isn't the primary entrance requirement for acceptance at the extension school the ability to write a check for $58,880? if you tell someone that you ""went to harvard"" without saying the words ""extension school"" afterwards, i think that you are either fooling yourself, or being disingenuous."
2,"> but isn't the primary entrance requirement for acceptance at the extension school the ability to write a check for $58,880?

my issue with this argument is that hes offers full financial aid to those who need it, and in certain circumstances (as far as i'm aware), will refund the cost of the 3 entry classes once you're admitted if you demonstrate through your aid application that it was a significant financial strain for you. i'd say (anecdotally) that 1/20 people at the university (outside of hes) that i meet don't consider hes ""real harvard"", and their argument is always that the barrier to entry at hes is the financial commitment. if that's the case, is an hes degree of someone receiving aid more legitimate than one who is paying their way through?

you're trying to put shame behind students carrying the name ""extension school"" on their degree which is wholly unnecessary. as an hes student, i see people all the time in my program who try to pass off their studies as being from the college or another graduate schools, which i find appalling. the idea that our degree is any less legitimate than any other student at the university's is mainly perpetuated by people outside the university, in my experience. a grandparent of mine with a degree from the university considered it legitimate, my family friends with degrees from the university consider it legitimate, the person i'm dating at the college considers it legitimate, the people i meet and become friends with outside of hes at the university consider it legitimate (going as far to tell me to stop adding on ""extension school when people ask me where i go to school). are all these people (who have no reason to lie to me, and have a track record of being brutally honest with me) systemically lying to me, even though they have no reason to? if so, why?"
3,"harvard college is one of most selective undergraduate schools in the country, and getting accepted has a significant amount of prestige attached to it. do some people get in, not because of their grades, but because their family has money? maybe; i actually have no idea, but that's not my point. nobody has to buy their way into the extension school, because hes is one of the least selective bachelor degree programs out there. for all intents and purposes, everyone gets accepted to the program. a couple of years ago, a high school student got his degree from hes before he finished high school. so yes, in theory an hes bachelor's degree would cost less than one from the college, but i don't think an hes degree would have the same value as a degree from the college. i don't think there's any shame in getting a degree from hes, or any school."
4,the only people i hear concerned about making sure harvard extension and harvard college are distinctly seperate are students/alum who were in harvard college. might not be as special as you think you are.
5,"whatever helps you sleep at night. there are 12 degree-granting schools at harvard, and only one of them has students that don't like to say the full name of their school."
6,"might be my favorite harvard meme ever, and i used to operate a harvard meme group. take my silver, op"
7,just fangirling over another harvard vegan (stalked your profile)! but this is gold.
8,"also important to follow the ""harvard time"" rule. when speaking to any person that you aren't certain is aware that you are a harvard student, make sure that you mention it within 7 minutes of meeting them. 
sometimes this can be tough because people want to talk about things that aren't relevant to your announcement. getting a harvard phone case and setting a 7 minute timer is key, if it hasn't come up within the first 6 mins, go ahead and pull up your phone so they can see it and google whatever subject they are talking about and harvard, there will usually be something that pops up and work that into the conversation quickly."

12,"lmao a few years after i graduated i was skiing and my crew ended up on the lift in front of me so i rode with some random dude who told me he went to stanford and kept talking about college. when we got to the top of the lift he asked where i studied and i said harvard and skied off lmao

i actually haven’t told anyone this story because i personally don’t like talking about h that much but i figure my story fits what you’re asking"
13,"oh i have a good one! my family moved from croatia to the us when i was 12 and we ended up living in a white picket fence suburb filled with trophy wives. our next door neighbor, a woman in her early 30s married to a 70 year old, was so uncomfortable about our croatian family living next door to her as if we were literal aliens. 

she would go as far as calling the hoa people and say things like ""people from the balkans are all aggressive, it's not a good look for us to have them here"" or she would question how we could afford living in that neighborhood and insinuate that my parents were involved in illegal activities. 

fast forward to my high school graduation when my best friend, who lived on the same street as us, and i decided to have a joint graduation party at my place. we invited everyone from our street and my parents (known for their wonderful croatian hospitality) didn't want to single out the rude trophy wife so they invited her and her family as well. she actually came alone, probably because she's nosy and wanted more gossip material, and got into a discussion about colleges with my best friend and her dad, while i stood next to them eating my hot dog. 

she was saying how happy she was that my friend got into columbia and how it's nice that some schools still have standards (my best friend is the typical rich girl coming from generational wealth with a fairly well known last name). she couldn't brag about her own college success because she didn't attend college so she mentioned that her step son is getting his phd at harvard. my best friend knew how that woman had treated my family for so long, and considering the obnoxious comment on standards she had just made, my friend decided to drop the h bomb for me.

""oh, really? pinkstardust007 is going to harvard, too. yeah, she's one of the 2 graduates from our school who got in."" 

she went on about my success for a few minutes with the biggest smirk on her face while the trophy wife stood there clenching her cocktail. that was one of the most satisfying moments i have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. take that, kelly."
14,"that's a damn good mic drop moment. people assume so much about people because of their job. 

hell, i know people who are lawyers but drive for uber for some extra money.

personally, the only 'satisfying moment' i had was when i let my father know that i'll be pursuing and finishing a degree from harvard - because he was never that supportive of my capabilities in school nor cared, he never went to college yet used to laugh at people who didn't stay in school (quite the hypocrisy) and most of all - my whole life he belittled me for being 'dumber'. he always treated me as if i was incompetent simply because i couldn't find the tool he wanted me to (even though it was never where he thought it was).

letting him know that i'm going to do well at a great university was not something i wanted to say to necessarily spite him - but i wanted him to know he was wrong about me. and that i did this without his help."
15,"a few years ago, i was working overseas and while having dinner with other expats, the topic of ethnicity came up. i told them i'm filipino and was born and raised in the philippines and didn't move to the us until i was in my teens. another expat asked this guy from hawaii if he is also filipino and he said he identifies as white (even though his entire family is ethnically filipino). he then started to berate filipinos and said how he cannot identify with them because all they do is send money back home, buy a shit load of spam and send it in balikbayan boxes. (while this is definitely very common for filipinos to do, i don't see anything wrong with it since it's their money and why does he care?) anyway, after the dinner, i opened my wallet and he saw my harvard id. he then asked in front of everyone, ""you went to harvard?"" i looked at him dead in the eye and said ""yeah, i went to harvard."""
16,"i hate talking about going to harvard, it feels unnecessary. the qualification should speak for itself if someone asks. i think a hallmark way to tell someone didn't really go to harvard is if they talk about it all the time 😂"
17,"i was in a taxi from the airport to a hotel on another university campus, where i was interviewing for a job as a professor. i look pretty young, so the driver asked me if i was a student at the university. i get this kind of thing a lot so it was no big deal, and i politely answered no, i was there to interview for a job as a professor. the driver looked at me in his rear view mirror and actually laughed at me and said “you? a professor? you look like a teenager.” and he kept laughing. i replied “i just got my phd from harvard” and that immediately shut him up. and i got the job!"
18,i was wine tasting with my friends and a dubitably audacious girl had the gall to ask us to sanitize our hands before partaking of the cheese tray. it was at this moment i whipped out my harvard silk handkerchief and my assistant darren pulled out a bottle of premium cognac hand sanitizer (one of the only 100 bottles made in july). he then proceeded to step in front of the lady and expunge several droplets to each guest. the look on her face was uproariously unparalleled!
19,"i was in line at the movie theater to have my ticket checked and my penis inspected. the two teenage girls behind me kept whispering and giggling and generally being a nuisance. when my turn came up, i dropped my pants, and the girls suddenly screeched with laughter. 

""oh my god, look at his penis! it's tiny,"" said one.

""hey retard, where'd the rest of your penis go?"" said the other.

i spun around to face them. ""retard?"" i said, ""retard? i'll have you know that i am a student of none other than the great harvard herself.""

their laughter stopped. you could have heard a pin drop. then, one old man started clapping slowly in his feeble and elderly fashion. soon others followed, until everyone started clapping and the whole theater was loud with claps. the two girls left without saying a word, and i read on the news that they died in a car crash on their way home."

36,">or i can watch mit open courseware for free

 i have a lot of respect for them and stanford. i also appreciate all the classes they have made available for free online. 

harvard does more than that (hopefully in all the classes) - it is renowned as our alma-mater (spirit mother) for a reason - it imparts a *spirit* which is far greater than the mechanics of videos and lectures & the logistical similarities it may have with mit or stanford or any university."
37,can you describe the spirit of sitting at home alone watching harvard lectures?
38,not sure that someone who takes this meme seriously goes to/went to harvard tbh
39,"i don't think the controversy is over harvard going full online, it's that they're charging the same tuition. i'm not saying anything about whether harvard is right or wrong in doing that, i'm just pointing out that i think that's where the discussion really is."
40,"i agree that not bringing everyone back to campus is the safest choice, but i disagree that the first years should be going back. harvard owes them nothing — they haven’t even submitted their final transcripts yet and could defer their acceptance with zero academic consequences. meanwhile existing students, who were treated unfairly by the school and received a stunted and subpar semester last spring, are given second priority. it’s not ideal to take time off as a junior or senior! makes no sense to me. there’s not going to be any on-campus networking or orientation activities for the first years because there can’t be (covid) so might as well bring the students back that have already dedicated hundreds of thousands of dollars to harvard."
41,"what sort of expenses do you think the university is no longer incurring due to remote learning? it's not like harvard is suddenly spending way less money in some area and can pass the savings on to you. you can certainly argue that tuition is too high using the same reasonable arguments people have been making for decades, but i'm not sure why a pandemic and remote learning should change the equation much."
42,"is the tuition that big of a deal though?

with the majority of students receiving financial aid, harvard applies as much aid as needed to meet the amount the student can pay.

if tuition is reduced, the grant amount will be reduced, and the student will pay the same in the end.

for students well off enough to not qualify for any aid, i do not feel pity for them paying the full tuition charge."
43,"and it's not like anything around campus will be the same. everything will be closed, dining hall will have restrictions. dorms will have crazy rules and restrictions. a university is a sex and germ filled cesspool, we all know it. all 20 year olds are the same. harvard is escaping a massive public health crisis here, not to mention the influx of out of state students would make it extremely complicated in terms of current ma state laws."
44,i go to berkeley and i just wanna say i really like how harvard came out and said it is going to be remote instruction up front. berkeley is officially hybrid but 96% of our classes are completely remote. it just makes the logistics even more difficult than it already is.
45,"i’d bring seniors back before first years, who have zero ties to harvard and can defer with no consequences."
46,"as an incoming first year student i agree that we shouldn't be going especially since harvard thinks it's to help us transition to college life when in reality there won't be upperclassmen there to show us what harvard culture is supposed to be. even when 100% of students return the freshmen will be outsiders since we won't even know our own college. but taking a gap year isn't as good as it sounds because they can't guarantee housing and there could be consequences for applying to grad schools if '25 is too large of a class.

the 40% space could've been used for seniors and others who need in person access to harvard"
47,"because people don't pay for the undergraduate education. 

if you wanted a good undergraduate education you wouldn't go to any major research university, you would go to a smaller college. if undergraduate instruction is what you want, then you should be at a school like williams. research universities serve to advance research, and the real money is spent on faculty doing research. undergraduate education is generally consider a lower priority than publishing papers.

students attend harvard for two things: (1) the cachet of the name on the diploma (and from a pure economic utility standpoint the admission letter should have the same value) (2) the political and economic connections one makes on campus. a small number of students also connect to and benefit from direct research opportunities while undergrads, but its not required, hard to do, and only a minority of students do this.

remote learning undercuts both of these. #2 is clearly lost, but #1 is undercut as people start to question the value of college degrees in general. why should an firm pay top dollar for a graduate from the covid years over a student who self-taught themselves the same material with online courses? what is the distinguishing element between the two?"
48,"it’s less about any perceived change in harvard’s expenses than it is about the clearly diminished value for students. 

in-person access to world-class faculty and peers notwithstanding, some of us need access to particular campus amenities (libraries, labs, studio spaces, equipment, etc.) that we would have under normal circumstances with normal tuition. 

but to give one small answer to your question, according to the last factbook published by the gsd (2017/2018), $11.5 million was spent on space, supplies, and travel, all expenses they will not have in 2020/2021. i’d be surprised if such expenses were unique to that department. 

the best analogy i’ve seen is this: you bought a luxury-class airline ticket, but halfway through the departing flight, through no fault of your own or the airline’s, you had to be relocated to the cargo hold (spring 2020). then on the return flight you had to spend the entire time down there (fall 2020-). 

the airline could reasonably argue that you got where you were going, which was the point of getting on the plane, but you sure as hell didn’t get what you paid for and you’d have every right to expect some of your money back."
49,you are incredibly foolish to think the average student at harvard wouldn’t greatly appreciate some sort of tuition discount. you don’t have to be rich to be paying at least in part for your education and every penny counts.
50,"yeah, i also don't think the first-year experience is going to be very interesting. the best part of the first-year experience (imo) is that you actually meet harvard, can join clubs, get to meet the upperclassmen and become a part of the culture on campus.

instead, it's going to be a bunch of high school seniors who don't have in-person classes only there for a semester before they leave. i think it's going to feel a lot like weird summer camp."

reconcile these arguments, please.

i don't know how anyone who has been at harvard could believe this statement to be true. you might be confusing professor incentives with [harvard's expenditures](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/28/harvards-endowment-is-worth-40-billionheres-how-its-spent.html). 

> a small number of students also connect to and benefit from direct research opportunities while undergrads, but its not required, hard to do, and only a minority of students do this.

what?[ about half of harvard students write a thesis, which is professor advised research.](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/05/on-thesis-day-harvard-students-celebrate-its-finally-finished/)"
52,"thank you for your well thought out response.

to your first point, i would clarify that i used the term student and family interchangeably in this context. regardless, i’m not entirely convinced that it matters who the burden falls upon. the calculation for the expected contribution accounts for both the family and the student wealth.

point 2, i agree that for those in the millionaire class, $200,000 for four years at harvard can certainly be a large sum of money. however, i still stand by my original statement. meaningful sacrifice for a millionaire can mean many things. it may be taking out a larger home mortgage, or it may mean fewer overseas vacations for a while. whatever it manifests as, it is not as meaningful of a sacrifice as a low income student who’s family may sacrifice a meal, an auto repair, a bill payment, or any number of things. the point being that the students benefiting from financial aid are mostly those who cannot afford to make meaningful sacrifices. those who have the privilege of millionaire level wealth may lose comforts, they may not live as extravagantly, but they are never going to be put to the brink of homelessness or financial ruin because of the cost of harvard for their child.

as for point 3, i do understand your argument, but i think that it is a leap to say that what is sold is not what is promised. my understanding is that harvard will still be continuing its liberal time off policy. any student can choose to leave the college until classes resume in person. if a student believes that the $50,000 tuition is not worth it for online classes, they can hold on the transaction until it becomes worthwhile. no tricks are being played, no one is being secretly ripped off."
53,"i'm not clear what you think needs to be reconciled.

as for the priorities of education vs research. i don't know anyone who has been at harvard who could believe this statement to be false. a significant portion of teaching for the first few years is done not by professors but by their graduate students. this is the norm at harvard and most major research institutions.

as for thesis it is a very different situation than being actively incorporated into a professors ongoing research activities. at smaller colleges that do not offer graduate programs students can be incorporated into the professors ongoing research as if they were graduate students (in fact they have to be because the professor has no graduate students)."
54,"> i'm not clear what you think needs to be reconciled.

your arguments are roughly ""the major value of harvard is the admissions letter"" and ""the only reason employers pay for a harvard degree is for some poorly defined notion of value which we must clearly accept to be gone in an online environment""
> a significant portion of teaching for the first few years is done not by professors but by their graduate students.

i'm a senior and i have literally never been in a class that was taught by a grad student. sure, they run sections and grade assignments -- but the teaching has always been done by the prof (who has also usually had extensive office hours and been very responsive to email). 

> as for thesis it is a very different situation than being actively incorporated into a professors ongoing research activities. 

this is again not true in my experience. when i was searching for a thesis advisor, they were all very explicit about only being interested in advising theses that pertained to their areas of research. 

> at smaller colleges that do not offer graduate programs students can be incorporated into the professors ongoing research as if they were graduate students (in fact they have to be because the professor has no graduate students).

yes, at the cost of having 'ongoing research' that is not interesting/rigorous enough to require grad students. my 9th grade biology professor has plenty of research opportunities as well."
55,"sure, but we are talking about harvard on r/harvard"
56,"> ""the only reason employers pay for a harvard degree is for some poorly defined notion of value which we must clearly accept to be gone in an online environment""

i never said i thought it was ""clear"", but i think it raises the question, and i don't know if elite institutions are prepared to answer the questions raised. how do you answer the question ""what makes a harvard graduate better than an x graduate?"" does your answer rely in some way on classroom instruction? or opportunities outside the classroom? how are those impacted by remote learning? is harvard really the best prepared for transitioning to remote learning, or will there be better outcomes for institutions that have focused on ""mass production"" of higher education and have prior experience with remote learning?

> sure, they run sections and grade assignments -- but the teaching has always been done by the prof 

i'm sure it varies by department, but my feeling is that the real learning was from the section, not the lecture. for the record i was a math major, and the real instruction on how to make mathematical arguments was in the detailed feedback we got from the grad students who graded our proofs, not the lectures where we learned the material.

in later years there would be a big difference between a course taught by a non-tenured professor and tenured faculty. if you could get a tenured professor teaching a course relevant to their area of study... it would be an amazing course, with constant nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout. on the other hand non-tenured faculty had to teach the course and would do so adequately, but you could tell their focus was on their own research not on the instruction.

> cost of having 'ongoing research' that is not interesting/rigorous enough to require grad students

that certainly is a valid criticism of schools like williams at least in my field. most harvard math majors graduate having completed most of the coursework required of phd programs in advance of prelims. whether or not that is actually valuable is a different question entirely.

as someone who can proudly admit to completing an abd, i can say its absolutely useless. could have saved a few years and a lot of grief by being guided through some research as an undergrad and realizing it wasn't my future."

73,"i know. focus on your own school, which is great. i thought, i am not going to listen to yalies talk about harvard for four years. many years later, i went to graduate school at yale. new haven had improved, but it was still bleak. i met a number of people who had gone to yale as undergrads and they adored yale. too bad i didn't meet those people during my weekend."
74,"that's just raw donation numbers, though. harvard brings in twice or three times as much donation money every year compared to most other us colleges: https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/2/8/harvard-fundraising-tops-stanford/

because of this, harvard probably leads us colleges in gifts received from almost any source. if you recompute the figures as a percentage of gifts received, harvard is no longer at the top of the list."
75,"given how long harvard only accepted the rich, the former probably implies the latter."
76,"as someone who graduated from harvard, i can confirm this. lol

whenever i meet people for the first time (or generally people i am not close with) i usually say i went to school up in boston hoping they wouldn't follow up with ""where?""

it's a thing."
77,"harvard grads are like vegans. how do you know someone's a vegan? don't worry, they'll tell you. 

we're also fond of saying that we went to school outside of boston and just never saying where."
78,"totally a thing. ""don't drop the h bomb"" or whatever. honestly, you just end up sounding even more like a douche. just say you went to harvard and don't be an asshole about it."
79,"i've never heard someone say ""i'd rather not say."" but there is a thing where if someone asks ""where do you go to school?"", harvard students are reluctant to say, because people invariably respond ""oh, hah-vard,"" as if by saying you go there you're a snob and you're bragging. so after a bit of this conditioning, you start answering something evasive like ""in boston."" of course, then they ask *where* in boston, so you just end up looking silly. 

i didn't think this happened with graduates, though."
80,"there was an episode of an old tv show (*spin city* i think), where one of the characters would say that they went to, ""the university in massachusetts,"" in order to avoid saying they went to harvard.

also the sidebar to this subreddit used to reference this stereotype as well saying something to the effect of, ""a subreddit for a university on the outskirts of boston, no not tufts..."". ( i just noticed it still does... lol)

edit: italics for *spin city,* and adding the final parenthetical."
81,"more than any other ivy, the outside world sees harvard's name as a symbol of elite higher education, which means that opinions differ on whether and when it's a good idea to ""drop the h-bomb"". either they think you're super smart and now you've got a lot to live up to, or it sounds like you're bragging, or they think you're snobby and rich, or it's just a little awkward. i think a good strategy is to answer honestly, but when they say ""wow!"" or whatever, it's your opportunity to laugh and say something like, ""yeah, it's kind of a crazy place""."
82,"yup, sadly been there. it feels just as akward trying to hide it, as it is for the other person trying to figure out why.

i'm not sure why keeping harvard off the table in a discussion tends to keep it flowing."
83,"""so, where'd you go to school?""  ""harvard"".  ""ooooooh, you must be sooooo smart!  what's the capital of rhodesia?""  or: ""your parents must be sooooo loaded!  take me on your next yacht vacation to the south pacific!""  or any number of permutations.  it gets annoying.  so you try to avoid saying it, and there's this whole elaborate dance: ""i went to a school in boston.""  ""bu?  or bc?""  ""well, not actually *in* boston.  well, i guess part of its campus actually is in boston.  it's *near* boston.""  ""ah, where?""  ""just north of the city.""  ""tufts?  or mit?""  ""no, the other one.""  ""lesley?  i didn't know part of their campus was in boston.""  and so on.  telling people your alma mater is known as ""dropping the h-bomb"".

as a software developer in the boston area, there's no need to play any of this game.  i just tell people i went to harvard (when it comes up, which is not very often) and continue on with my life."
84,i just say i go to college in the northeast. i feel like there’s no good way to tell someone u go to harvard without sounding braggy or w/e. i’m from the south so they usually don’t ask for the specific college but if they do i’ll tell em

87,it’s true but i prefer to approach it like “in college...” rather than “at harvard...” because the latter can come off as arrogant too.
88,"fun story. i was once walking through nyc with a harvard shirt on--it was right after i met with admissions and i was *very* proud. 

getting off the subway at times square, a man ran up to me, holding bags of cans and smelling....not good. he looks down at my shirt, then up at me, and yells ""sure, harvard's a fine school, but have you ever heard of tufts?!"" then scuttled away. 

i love nyc."
89,"probably since forever? most graduate students at harvard were not competitive enough to get accepted into harvard for undergrad. i don't think you can actually compare the two because graduate vs. undergraduate admissions look for different things, and a lot can change about a person in four years. ignoring that, most competitive graduate programs have an acceptance rate higher than the college. prestige is a weird thing, nobody really cares about your graduate program's ranking unless they're in the same field as you, so to the average person, it doesn't mean anything."
90,"the acceptance rate for the college is lower (unless you’re a legacy or a recruited athlete... in which case the admit rate goes up almost twenty-fold and is much less impressive) i work in institutional research which is a field solely focused on higher ed data and analysis so i’m just going based off of stats... acceptance rates are one commonly used measure and we could also look at outcomes... but academics’ egos aren’t something we have a great measurement tool for so i can’t account for whatever water cooler chat happens at academic conferences ;) 

also harvard practices holistic admission, so trying to downplay the achievements of some of your classmates by insinuating that “affirmative action” helped them get in (below) is extremely racist and also just plain wrong. it looks like you’re an incoming student- i hope you fix your attitude before you alienate people and continue to make your department look bad."
91,i would have to agree with this one. the thought of going to harvard never crossed my mind for my undergraduate. but now after finishing undergrad and getting into a field i really enjoy and excel at - harvard became a first choice in advancing my education in that field.
92,i love this. used to date a girl at harvard & the turkeys always made me so happy to see roaming around.

97,"they are still in discussions with the schools on writing a new directive, but if you are in a program that is not normally online, then it will be ok.

“another edit: we’re looking at legal and moral options. the goal is to find a balance of getting credit for our work and not crushing dalbert in the process. i think what a lot of the more extreme people on this sub are missing is that although what he did is absolutely reprehensible, he’s also just a kid. all that he’s probably seen of startups is tense and dramatic movies/shows, so this might just feel like part of the deal to him. i think we can all take this as a learning experience and not a punitive one, getting our credit, being more careful in the future, and hopefully for dalbert, understanding the importance of actual collaboration.

we appreciate your support, but do not use this as an excuse to bully dalbert. we’re all flawed and learning how to do better, and he deserves that same chance.“

i thing he is spot on. obviously what he did is reprehensible, but at the end of the day he is just a dumb kid. he didn’t kill/rape/kidnapped someone, his mistake is purely ethical and moral. something like that can be fixed by attending a good college, like harvard, and having a couple of ethics courses."
103,"of course, i am in no way promoting bullying of the guy behind all this, and i think the technology developed is still useful, but this deserves attention because it’s a problem that needs to be stopped.

he is using our class as a promotion. he runs our harvard 2024 groupme, the instagram, etc all to promote his business and its creepy. he has even planted himself in duke/uchicago/ etc groupchats to try and scam others. we need to stop this now so that more people aren’t hurt. 

i admire the work at hand, but it was still made through corrupted means, people were screwed over and he’s being a predator to further himself. clean that stuff up is all we’re asking for here and stop exploiting brilliant students who deserve better."

114,"threatening to stab people and watch them bleed out is not an analogy, it is not professional, it is not acceptable, and it is not what harvard would want its students to be associated with.

shame on her and same on anyone out there making excuses for her. no one forced her to make a hateful video. she did that all on her own. actions have consequences and this was hers. she needs to learn from her mistake and not make it next time."
115,she got exactly what she deserved.  no harvard graduate ever should say “i’ma.”
116,"i'm surprised this girl graduated from harvard university. its like she hasn't learned the concept of consequences for your actions or the professionalism of keeping your social media persona filtered enough for this not to happen.

all in all just a bad analogy and very poor choice of trying to be edgy. even more cringe is seeing her not take responsibility for it and blaming ""trump supporters"". its like she has learned nothing and even went the step to say deloitte had cowardice for firing her. lol good luck having future companies see that last line. they will know how immature you are"
117,"intellectuals: ah, she didn’t say “i possess the sincere intention to figuratively impale the next individual that declares the statement, ‘all lives matter’.” surely, she is not a harvard graduate."

129,"we all know it would read ""harvard student found dead in river that runs through harvard"""

143,apparently it was a harvard college (undergrad) student living in leverett. this is the info that’s been circulating on campus for the past 48 hours or so (before the shutdown was announced).
144,"very convenient for them to receive the tests results on friday at 6pm after classes had ended for spring break. i'm sure that the sudden decision to kick everyone off campus was in no way related to the possibility of knowing this result earlier. 


funny how things be, right? would have been so inconvenient had harvard had to cancel classes mid-week. but alas, they obviously didn't have the result back until friday night after classes ended. of course."
145,"agreed. with so much conjecture, we all just have to isolate and let this play out. i’m disappointed that harvard didn’t release more info so that those most at risk of community spread can know to be more vigilant."
146,"i'm most frustrated by their contradictory position that tuition will not be prorated because degrees and course are continuing even though in-person interactions aren't, but that the campus aims to reopen with all haste because everyone understands that much of the value of harvard is in the people and the interactions.

harvard is stealing the words from ray liotta's lips: ""fuck you, pay me.""

147,"agreed with little new info from larry's email, but i'd rather have that than radio silence i suppose.  i just wish harvard could have made up their minds about removing students from campus - though in all fairness, they did help financially.  i can't imagine being at a lower tier school that didn't care at all."
148,"bacow can only send a vague email because each school is it's own fiefdom, and each school will have their own decision regarding class resumption.  he can't speak for all the schools.  harvard isn't unified like that.  it's not convenient at times like these, but it's part of what gives harvard an academic edge and arguably superior instruction.  i know several professors would would rather go work elsewhere than be told what to do."
149,"why would tuition be less?  aren't you still getting a harvard degree?  is that degree somehow more valuable if you sit in a lecture hall than your sofa, provided it's the same material?"
150,"why must tuition be discounted?  you don't have to pay room and board when you're not at the school.  is the harvard degree worth less because you are learning from a couch?  if you want a cheaper harvard degree, take classes at the extension school and get an extension school diploma."
151,"if you think harvard's value remains undiminished by removing in-person interactions, i'm afraid we disagree. the material learnt is only part of the value of harvard, and i would venture to say, not necessarily the most valuable part."
152,"when we pay $50k for tuition we're paying for much more than just the piece of paper that says we have a harvard degree. we're paying for the opportunities to interact one-on-one with world class students and the best of professors, work on research projects, represent athletic teams, take part in extracurriculars, make use of libraries, labs, and other communal work spaces, and contribute to and learn from an incredibly diverse community. ""learning from a couch"" strips away every single aspect of a harvard education."
153,"or maybe not all of us can afford your apathy. harvard prohibits master's students from accessing scholarships and financial aid, so i just paid $75k out of pocket for a half online experience. i had to make a very tough, very costly decision whether to go to harvard and the main reason i chose to attend (the community) was just cut from beneath me. had this been any other school, i wouldn't have gone, and i had exactly this conversation with a mentor at work before making this decision; he said if it was any other school, don't go, but for harvard, the cost might be worthwhile.

so to summarize: you're wrong, you're arrogant, and the answer to your question disproves your point."
154,"what are other schools doing?  are they also discounting?  i have to wonder if harvard had kept the government funding, if it would have allowed for discounting?  the problem with the endowment is it's essentially pre-allocated because of donor-restrictions and interest drawn-down, so it's not really a source of contingency funding for tuition.  i have to imagine employee union contracts are eating into contingency funds?"
155,"i'm sorry but i just don't understand how a ""discount"" makes it okay?  i get it - it sucks.  this isn't what anyone wants.  there are plenty of studies that show correlation between ""value"" (or satisfaction) and cost (or pay), so it's only natural to want to get something for what has been lost.

not that harvard needs to wait and see, but what are other schools doing?"

176,"well, you did get *some* of the harvard campus in the shot.  there's clav and adams and dewolfe.  it's something, right?

it's a great picture of cambridge, though."
177,"yes, hard to call it a picture of ""the"" harvard campus when the only part of harvard yard is the backside of lamont. here's roughly the [drone view in 3d google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.370578,-71.1180403,66a,35y,55.91h,75.22t/data=!3m1!1e3)."

179,there’s a great spot called lamont cafe where you’ll find tons of harvard students on friday and saturday nights. it’s right in harvard square and definitely walkable from lowell. 
180,"house parties and dorm parties aren’t as big a thing on this campus as you’d think. especially if you’re not students and trying to just randomly show up somewhere. there’s lots of bars right in harvard square though, if you’re over 21 you’ll be able to meet lots of students in the bars a block or so from the yard."
181,"thanks! any specific bars that are nice? we’ve been to john harvard’s yesterday and shays today, but since we’re not used to american bars we’re not sure how they hold up to the competition. "
182,"it depends what time. john harvard bar can be hit or miss and it’s an older crowd a lot. surprisingly a lot of good nights start at felipe’s on brattle st, mexican restaurant and bar. the beat brew hall is a good place to start. start conversations and try to join a group and bar hop with them.

183,i'm 10 and decided i am going to harvard. should i choose jif or can i have skippy?

187," dear members of the harvard community,  
 

on this friday, june 19, the university will be closed to commemorate juneteenth. all faculty and staff will have a full day of paid time off. if you must work that day to support essential operations, your efforts will be acknowledged with other paid time off.  
 

long celebrated as an independence day in the african american community, juneteenth marks the day—155 years ago this year—that enslaved african american people in texas were told of their freedom from bondage. it offers a moment to acknowledge and celebrate the promise of a new beginning, and i cannot imagine a better year for harvard to begin recognizing its significance. these are extraordinary times distinguished by extraordinary displays of passion and resolve. we are everywhere reminded of the possibility of something different—something better—for our communities, our states, and our nation, as well as the deep reflection and hard work getting there will require of all of us.  
 

throughout the week, the *harvard gazette* will be featuring [related coverage and resources](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/series/the-quest-for-racial-justice/), and i encourage you to learn more about the many ways in which members of our community are advancing the cause of racial justice in america. each of us has a role to play in considering the past and the present as we work together to imagine our future, and i am proud to undertake that important—and essential—work with all of you.  
 

all the best,

188,what happened? harvard is charging to retrieve possessions for students who left back in march?
189,"olympia is charging to continue storing and or shipping items and even though harvard is “subsidizing”, it barely covers the costs"
190,"i looked up the sauce on 'ol boy. ok..he's clearly trading/profiting off the harvard name, then tried to get some duke prefrosh rescinded? wtf?"
191,"this is a valid concern and we are trying to address it. many of the other groupme admins and i have been trying to get into contact with albert to find out if 1. he has actually committed to going to harvard,  2. to share ownership of the instagram account because it is as good as class property now and no single person should have control of the account, and 3. to make a response to all allegations that is acceptable to the people directly involved in helping code the original application. right now, in regards to the instagram, there is nothing we can do without albert's cooperation other than making a new instagram but that would be a big hassle (it is not out of the picture though).

\-aldo"
192,"not saying what this kid did is okay, but if harvard rescinds his admission after it lets sexual predators stay on campus i’d be very sad."
193,"i read this on another thread, from one of the guys that *worked* on the project. 

“another edit: we’re looking at legal and moral options. the goal is to find a balance of getting credit for our work and not crushing dalbert in the process. i think what a lot of the more extreme people on this sub are missing is that although what he did is absolutely reprehensible, he’s also just a kid. all that he’s probably seen of startups is tense and dramatic movies/shows, so this might just feel like part of the deal to him. i think we can all take this as a learning experience and not a punitive one, getting our credit, being more careful in the future, and hopefully for dalbert, understanding the importance of actual collaboration.

we appreciate your support, but do not use this as an excuse to bully dalbert. we’re all flawed and learning how to do better, and he deserves that same chance.“

i thing he is spot on. obviously what he did is reprehensible, but at the end of the day he is just a dumb kid. he didn’t kill/rape/kidnapped someone, his mistake is purely ethical and moral. something like that can be fixed by attending a good college, like harvard, and having a couple of ethics courses."
194,"> something like that can be fixed by attending a good college, like harvard, and having a couple of ethics courses.

in all my experience with ethics courses (and i've had to take quite a few as part of funding requirements), never have they changed anyone with a tendency for bad behavior."
195,"i think the e-learning model of ""commenting"" on posts and video responses is counterproductive. i really think that is why online education has a bad reputation. i think some instructors are taking a flawed model of online education and bringing it to harvard.  i have taken online classes like this at another university and this type of education really did not feel good.

that classes as hes are not like that in my opinion. with the exception of one class, all my classes followed a normal schedule of weekly meetings, papers, zoom session, breakout groups, etc.

i think the type of online education you are describing would frustrate me to no end. while the online technology environment has transferred from hes, i think some teaching lessons and methods have not. tbh, it has got to be hard on instructors & tf's making the shift online also.

it is frustrating, but hopefully you can get back to in-person classes soon.

&#x200b;

disclaimer: i am speaking of hes in the last few years, don't know what online education was before zoom."
196,"yes. it’s far more work and organization and way less discourse, interaction, and deep thought. it’s the worst of organizational bloat while missing the best of academia. 

i stand by my assertion that it is impossible to get the quality of education that harvard normally provides through an online/zoom format. it doesn’t translate, no matter how much time is spent on a zoom call, breakout rooms, or discussion boards."
197,"i 100% agree with op. i’m at hes and this is my 3rd semester. i’m taking 4 classes and several of the professors are harvard professors but this is their first time teaching on zoom.

for whatever reason this semester there are so many odd assignment dates, sunday for the tuesday class, 30 minutes early for the zoom section on thursday. discussion deadlines that seem so arbitrary. i’ve already missed one deadline.

ugh."
198,"i agree with rescinding kashuvs admission. i don’t want to echo what many already mentioned but i think that his response on twitter was not only weak but another indicator for missing maturity and lack of integrity and character. only giving his argumentation i would highly doubt he would even been a good fit for harvard college.

edit: a word"
199,"100% agree with this decision. kashuv says he's being proactive by emailing the office of diversity about his actions, but why was he not proactive with acknowledging and rectifying his offensive comments *before* they were made public and broadcasted on media? he is only ""remorseful"" because he got caught with these messages coming to light. this is not about politics. there are plenty of conservative, pro-gun students enrolled at harvard. this is about rescinding a student who said some truly racist, hateful things. the last time harvard rescinded admissions it was about those kids posting offensive memes. this case seems much the same. his excuse that he was  just 16, immature, and never-intending to do harm is laughable. no one cares about your intentions - the effects, outcomes, and perception of your actions are what matter.

&#x200b;

he also criticizes harvard for not recognizing that someone can ""grow and learn from their actions."" nowhere did harvard say that it doesn't believe in a person's capacity to grow. perhaps harvard did see growth in kashuv but did not deem it enough. keep in mind that there are literally thousands of other applicants who are just as, *if not more*, qualified than kashuv who did not say such offensive, hateful words. give the admission spot to one of those."
200,"""student loses harvard spot over racist slurs & claims “throughout its history, harvard's faculty included slave owners, segregationists, bigots and anti-semites” which is a bit like saying ‘you’ve hired unintelligent racists before, why stop now'? ""

202,"harvard arguing that people cannot grow, mature, and change. everyone there should be ashamed. you don’t have to agree with his political views to see that this is ridiculous. once society stops forgiving others everything is going to break down. everyone, liberals and conservatives, has said terrible things that do not reflect the people they are today and that they are ashamed of.

harvard, a university not without blemishes and lapses in judgment itself, is using this kid’s stupid, thoughtless, and harmful remarks from years ago to keep a student with political views not in line with theirs out. he certainly regrets his remarks and has apologized profusely, can’t we just extend a little grace?

i’m sure everyone on that admissions board has said things that would mortify them and that would get them fired if the outrage mob found out—only they’re lucky enough to not have been caught yet."
203,i’m a black student. i’ve been called the n word and faced many other forms of racism by whom i’m sure are those defending this decision. you all are hypocrites. he’s a racist but so are most white people at harvard and elsewhere
204,"i suspect kyle was rescinded because he was jewish. harvard has had a long history of anti-semitism, and it is not surprising that they would look for an excuse to get rid of a pro-israel jewish student."
205,"i've lost all my respect for harvard. what a garbage organization. talk about hypocrisy. harvard is actively involved in a lawsuit for purposefully discriminating against asian applicants, yet they have the nerve to brand a kid a racist because of some thoughtless comments he made on a google doc two years ago? and they're saying he's irredemable. once a racist, always a racist, even if you were a teenager who typed it into a computer. it's a bogus standard that is unfairly applied. i'm sure 100% of the student population has never said or written anything distasteful ever in their entire life, otherwise they would be unfit to go to harvard and wouldn't have gotten in, right?

it's a media hit job because the kid is conservative. the ""friends"" that ratted him out are just as guilty, yet i don't see any stories about them having their college admissions revoked. in fact, the media haven't even released the names of the friends because they're liberals and must be shielded from consequence."
206,guy is a complete fucking idiot for sending emails and trying to use “freedom of speech” costing everything for no reason lol. tell nikolas cruz to get you into harvard now 😂
207,"i am a staunch believer in second chances and the ability to change. however, there are enough exceptional applicants to harvard to fill its class many times over, so every transgression has to be rightfully scrutinized since there is always another applicant who is just as qualified and uniquely accomplished while also not being guilty of said transgression (at least to the best of the school's knowledge). even if harvard doesn't go to the waitlist, the synergy of the class is so extremely important (as a result of the fact that it is the main consideration which allows the admissions committee to choose one of every dozen or so qualified applicants) that what this guy did damaged his merit beyond repair by virtue of merely damaging harvard's ability to *trust* in his commitment to tolerance and diversity.

additionally, the fact of the matter is the school simply can't know if the guy's changed. in his letter, he continues to refer to the shooting as an event which critically changed his perspective, and his response to it as evidence of this changed perspective, but nowhere does he explain how the event or his response were meaningfully specific to values of diversity and tolerance, which i suspect is a major reason why harvard rescinded him."
208,you'd have a better argument if harvard weren't one of the most selective universities in the world. there's no shortage of qualified candidates who haven't said what this guy said.
209,"harvard isn’t saying he can’t grow and mature. hopefully he does.

he demonstrated he doesn’t share harvard’s values, so they decided to give his slot to one of the thousands of amazing students they otherwise would’ve had to turn down."
210,"
> he’s a racist but so are most white people at harvard and elsewhere

if we're so racist, why did we rescind his admission? thanks for the generalization, though. have you ever visited? have you even ever *met* a student or alum?"
211,"then why would they have accepted him in the first place? clearly, they must have viewed his activism as a positive. harvard' view is clearly that political diversity is good, racism and hate speech is not. seems simple to me."
212,harvard is racist vs asians. this guy is racist vs black people. there’s no reason as a society we should accept either.
213,who said he doesn’t have any chance to redeem himself? why does he need to go to harvard in order to redeem himself?
214,"the credentials to get into harvard are based on academic success. you can't subjectively apply a morality test to some students and not others. there are people who have been in prison that have gone to harvard. why are they allowed forgiveness, but not this kid?"
215,"as someone who has never attended harvard, and likely never will, i generally find myself in agreement with those highlighting the interests of your institution’s admissions office. however, i do think the discovery of this information during the interim period makes this decision much more difficult. 

had this information been discovered during the initial review of kyle’s application, harvard’s citation of their right to deny anyone for any reason would be a perfectly satisfactory explanation in my view. however, i personally view that offers of admission should only be rescinded when information reflecting a negative change in an individual’s character *relative to the initial review of their application* is presented. obviously this is just my personal opinion, and does not conflict with harvard’s right to deny anybody for any reason, but i think that reasoning becomes less legitimate if someone has already made steps to adjust their character to match that of the harvard community. 

however, as you correctly pointed out, kyle did a fairly poor job at demonstrating how he’s changed. even if a change in a candidate’s character is redeemable based on when the candidate initiated such change, i still question whether the magnitude of change was satisfactory in kyle’s case. i am not an admissions officer, so i am not qualified to make this judgement, but i would be less inclined to scrutinize someone already admitted as heavily as someone who has not already been admitted."
216,"racism is institutionally supported at harvard today - look at the way the admissions staff treat asian people. 

that said i don’t get the people making excuses for this guy. 16 is plenty old enough to know better. this is unacceptable language. and that’s coming from someone who thinks political correctness is ruining elite universities and we have gone way to far in policing what students can say and do."
217,"actually that’s not true at all. admission to top colleges in the usa are not just base on academics. they require that you list your extracurriculars and you are required to summit recommendations which not only expand on your academic ability but how you are as a person. after i got into yale i received an personalized note from my regional admissions officer saying the thing that stood out about my application was that i was always willing to help people even when i had little means to do so. harvard receives 45,000+ applicants and rejects 40,000+. harvard can fill their class 10 times over with academically qualified students. 

also, can’t it be argued that those who went to prison already faced their punishment? kyle’s punishment was being rescinded from harvard. now he has to face those consequences.

edit: what crimes did they commit? i doubt harvard is admitting hardened criminals."
218,"

“however, i personally view that offers of admission should only be rescinded when information reflecting a negative change in an individual’s character relative to the initial review of their application is presented.”

how about if someone lied in their application? all of harvard’s offers are always conditional. they expect you to follow / to have had followed their moral code."
219,harvard has a long waiting list of non-racist applicants who would die to get in. it's not hard.
220,you seem to be expending excessive analytical effort in rank-ordering (your personal view) of horrific and disqualifying sentiments far beyond what's needed to make a decision on harvard admissions.
221,"it seems subjective to me. would a current student at harvard be kicked out for using the n-word? probably not. has there ever been a racist student at harvard? considering that they let in a lot of chinese people, i'm guessing yes. chinese people are as racist as they come, but they get a free pass since they don't have white skin. it's okay to be racist as long as you aren't white."
222,"wow, those assumptions you’re making are crazy. i’m not a harvard student but i assume it’s much more difficult to kick out a student that has already matriculated. i assume they do have some sort of disciplinary action. additionally, it’s not just about the use of the n word. kyle targeted it at certain students in his school."
223,"yikes dude. here’s my thinking organized nice and simply since it looks like writing and typing coherently might not have been your concentration here:

writing the n-word is bad. very bad. it’s a bad word.

when you’re a 16-year-old boy, you sometimes say things that wouldn’t say as someone with literally an iota of sense

the bad things he wrote were on a private doc shared with friends. now, someone in this thread seems to have seen it was shared with his class - maybe that’s different, but i’ve only seen language about it being a private doc for friends. i don’t want to live in a world where my private communications from any time are fair game for harvard or really any other institution. if you think it’s okay to empower random people from your earlier life to give you to “okay” to go to harvard then that’s your prerogative, i guess."
224,">	the stupid assumption any “friends” or classmates are going to feel bound to keep your ugly racist secrets is some first class privilege.

if the document was shared amongst kids we assume were friends, it’s more than likely there was more than just one person saying these “shocking” things. jokes amongst friends usually don’t go reported to institutions/social media/etc typically because the members of the group realize that what is said is being said in jest, not as a reflection of a racist viewpoint. my point isn’t about any oath of secrecy between friends, it’s that friends realize what is racism and what is a joke. if you spill “hey; kyle said the n-word” to harvard, they don’t think it’s anything like a joke.

i understand that this could even mean that: kyle was in a google doc with his friends and used the n word in a genuinely racist way, but his friends were horrified by him, but withheld that information until exactly the right time between acceptance and matriculation where he would be maximally screwed. if that’s the story you’d like to believe, then that works  too.

“concentration” just means major at harvard. usually this sub is for students and alumni."
225,"tell me: does a person who repeats the same emotionally-charged word over and over again sound more like a nine-year-old who just learned the word “fuck,” or like a hardened racist espousing his ideology?

look, i get it’s possible. you say the n-word, that’s certainly a clue you’re a racist. my point is that it’s far more likely it was a stupid, youthful, redeemable mistake. beyond that, i think the incentive structure harvard creates for high school enemies is beyond ridiculous.

thanks for visiting!"
226,"so harvard should admit teenagers who recently acted like (racist) nine year olds?  amazing logic. 
and the shades of racist thing? they’re all racist, no matter what excuses you try to make. the child didn’t make any attempt to redeem himself, all evidence points to him being a racist.  he’s apparently trying to make a career of it already.  he put himself in the spotlight by being a racist ass already, this just double confirmed it.

there are lots of ridiculous things about harvard, but declining invites to hateful bigots isn’t one of them."
227,haters gonna hate. trump wishes he could’ve bought a harvard degree.
228,"one reason could be that harvard’s peer institutions, such as stanford and princeton, didn’t take the money."
229,"because harvard is harvard and byu is byu. one is the most famous school in the world, the other is that place where those chipper door-to-door people go for college...isn't there musical about it or something?

harvard also has a ~25x bigger endowment (admittedly the church of lds has vast holdings too, but they're doing more than just running a school)."
230,"because harvard, as policy, doesn't fight back, so they are an easy target.  harvard lays down, rolls over, and goes to pick a different fight.  

all that money was targeted at students, and frankly, that's all they had to say.  instead, harvard is asking every department to save money - which, ultimately, impacts the quality of education and experience for the students.

so, instead of helping the students, they will be 'hurt'.

harvard politics."
231,https://freebeacon.com/latest-news/harvard-not-paying-all-workers-during-coronavirus-shutdown-despite-40-9b-endowment/
232,"i do not hate harvard in the least, and apologize if my comments conveyed that type of tone. i admire harvard a great deal for many reasons, its funding for fgli students most of all. it is this singular issue in this singular time. i teach at a private university outside of philadelphia; our endowment is about 800m. of course we could use the money (and likely are). i don’t think we should use the funds, either. this pandemic is going to kill many schools. i’d prefer to help the good ones survive. no insult intended.

kinda thin skinned, aren’t ye though? i went to oxford and no one flexes. no need, you see."
233,"byu’s endowment size isn’t really relevant, imo. the separation of funding pools in the mormon church is blurry at best. with the exception of their for profit arms, the rest of it may as well all be in one big bank account. i tend to agree with most everything else you said, but the mormons could probably purchase harvard outright and not even miss the money."
234,"this is misleading. 80% of harvard's endowment is legally earmarked towards very specific spending as outlined in the legal contract. they don't have their full endowment at their disposal to spend as they please

despite this, harvard has one of the best financial aid packages in the nation, due to aggressive fundraising for scholarships. i'd stop drinking the hatorade, son."
235,"they probably have ~$100bn of value, but a lot of that is in-use real estate and they have a lot more going on than a university. agreed that their 'real' endowment is bigger than ~$2bn, but it's still not effectively close to harvard's."
236,don't go to harvard but congrats and absolutely loved merkel's commencement speech!!
237,"it me

just graduated with my first masters from penn state.  all online, never been there in person and couldn’t even go up for an in-person graduation.  now i’m doing another masters program online at harvard.  fingers crossed i’ll at least get to come up to cambridge for graduation this time."
238,"or worse:

""what's harvard like?""

""not sure, never been."""
239,"well, harvard still doesn’t have a hoar house yet, either."
240,"quoth harvard on twitter:

>more than a century after the existence of black holes was first hinted at in einstein’s theory of general relativity, a team of astronomers led by harvard scientists have, for the first time captured an image of a black hole."
241,"i know who three of those people are, but i was never in that group. i was in another group though and i remember just watching the drama unfold and asking myself how those idiots got into harvard in the first place. it was a really big deal at the time and i know a few people deactivated their social media accounts for a while, i'm assuming because they probably had posted offensive things when they were younger and they didn't want that coming back to bite them in the tush. 

with all of that being said, i'm not upset that they get to pursue higher education at top universities without the world knowing what they did. today's cancel culture is brutal and everything is set in stone, or on twitter. no matter how much a person apologizes and how hard they commit to changing themselves, very few people will see it as genuine and their name will forever be tied to something moronic they said online. although change and education should be something you do for yourself, not for the sake of restoring your reputation, clearing your name is still important for any future endeavors. harvard was absolutely right to cut ties with them, i supported that decision back then and i support it now, just like i support the anonymity of those involved. 

don't get me wrong, being 17 doesn't excuse their behavior, especially in today's world. but i think it's okay that they got to move on, all we can do now is hope that being told to fuck off by harvard was a learning experience. i know some people were upset that they ""got away without consequences"", but i'd argue that being set back for a whole year and not being able to attend the university you really wanted to attend is an appropriate consequence for their action of creating offensive memes."
242,"unpopular opinion, these kids posted inappropriate memes when they were still in high school. they lost a fucking harvard admission over it. i'm willing to bet they learned their lesson and had a full year to reflect on why they lost their dream school and am pretty fine with them still getting to have a life after _posting memes on the internet_. 

to be clear, there was no pattern of racism, there is, as far as i am aware, not one hint of racist action in real life. 

i'm not saying what they did was right and i do wholeheartedly condemn their actions, but this seems much more like a case of some kids getting caught up in shitposting than genuine malicious intent. i would rather live in a society where posting a meme doesn't ruin someone's life.

fwiw, a high school student posting racist memes in a meme group and a medical resident posting that she would ""purposefully give the wrong medication to jewish people"" are not even in the same galaxy of fucked up."
243,"it seems like cancel culture has gotten a lot more extreme just in the past three years. whoever reported the harvard students probably sent a discreet email to admissions, but now it seems more likely that they'd blast these students across social media. news outlets eat this stuff up, and if an article about your racist memes/tweets are the first thing that comes up when your name is googled, well, good luck getting a job or into any school now."
244,"the resident was around 22 (not in medical school) when she made the tweet, and pretty much all of the rescinded harvard students were 18. i think if you look at the particulars of the situation, though, it was clear the resident harbored anti-semitism, while the harvard students were posting everything offensive under the sun -- in my opinion, they were just going for ""edge"", not necessarily targeting a specific group of people. additionally, several of the harvard students appeared to be members of the ethnic groups they were mocking. that doesn't excuse what they did, of course, but it does serve to differentiate the situations.

that said, they were not a bunch of silly kids. they were 18 -- old enough to vote, join the military, and so on."
245,"ummmmm, no.

246,"were they 18? it’s not uncommon for some of us to have late birthdays after all. 

again, i’m not arguing against the rescinding of their admissions. i’m arguing against a continued witch hunt against these individuals for singular instances of what may have been immature indiscretions instead of indications of underlying deep belief systems (remember we still work on a presumption of innocence) before they matriculated at harvard. 

the thing that differentiates the med school student (i didn’t realize she had posted before med school) is her inclusion of medicine in her posts. 

if i post a racist comment vs i post a racist comment about shooting people and then go buy a gun... the second case is much more serious."
247,">**premise 2:**  
>  
>it can be reasonably assumed that this poster used the phrase ""ruining someones life"" in reference to harvard's rescindment of admission, and the associated fallout -- regardless of exaggeration, no one can deny that these are serious consequences (whether or not you believe they were enough or too much).conclusion:this poster would like to live in a society where \[blatantly racist behavior\] does not \[bring about significant negative consequences\].this is what we have freedom of speech for! say it proudly -- there's no need to hide behind vague statements and concepts, tell us all where you really stand :)

it seems obviously wrong that ""ruining someone's life"" was used in reference to rescinding harvard admission.

the poster said ""...am pretty fine with them still getting to have a life... "" which first introduces the idea of ""having a (presumable not ruined) life"" in the context of attending another, non-harvard school. also, nowhere in the post does he seem to condemn harvard rescinding admission, in fact he brings up the positive point of the student getting to reflect on their wrong actions. so it is incorrect to assume he is against harvard rescinding at all.

in the context of the post, ""ruining someone's life"" would be better considered as preventing the student from subsequently attending \*any\* highly ranked school. the poster seems fine with them having the serious consequence of having a ""fucking harvard admission"" rescinded. consequently, your conclusion does not follow."
248,"c'mon, it's pretty lame. the schools don't pay any taxes to the city. they only volunteer to throw in a token donation for an amount of their choosing. i'm not going to give them credit for shelling out a few extra bucks when they're stingy with their tax donation every single year.

255,harvard’s internet is insane. one time i plugged into the ethernet and was pulling over 500 mb / sec download speeds
256,"yes, but only if harvard actually pays property taxes to the city."
257,"agree. until non-harvard affiliates learn how to social distance and properly wear a mask (over both mouth and nose at the same time) then the campus, including the yard, should be closed to the public. the objective is to keep the harvard community safe while the world continues to grapple with a viral pandemic."
258,"i agree. and i want to clarify - i don't dislike tourists and locals on walks and such on campus. i'm actually happy to give tourists mini-tours because i love talking about harvard's history. they're often really nice.

the only issue is that their normal behavior also isn't super responsible/safe, right now.

i'd be 100% okay with the yard being open during this time if it didn't get so packed with people who don't respect distancing and not get in the way of students wanting to work. this just isn't the time to be bumped into, tripped over or have your space invaded so someone can get a selfie.

during this time, there's no reason why non-students 'need' to be there if they aren't being responsible.

any other year, everyone coming onto campus is something i've gotten used to, of course. and it's cool with me during any other time."
259,the building themselves are closed - it's the campus at large (mainly harvard yard/old yard) that's packed full of people who are not students.
260,lmao harvard has the endowment of billions more than the gdp of some countries and can’t provide its students with stable wifi is insane

269,i doubt they are having in person this fall since so many other harvard schools are going remote this fall but they are offering deferrals.
270,"exactly what i am doing. i already did some of these professional degrees at my local university for cheap, but need something more customizeable and specialized course wise online from harvard so hes it is."
271,the whole point of harvard is the people you meet and connections you make. online really hurts that. if i were a mc mpp i'd try to delay admission until this blows over. as a one year degree they don't have time to effectively make this up.
272,i wish i had that option. harvard is being terrible right now
273,"unbelievable, harvard went from ""giving asian americans lower scores on personality test"" to ""high school teachers write weaker recommendations for asian american students"". pretty much discrimination and defamation at the same time."
274,"even when harvard was given information by an expert connected with the plaintiffs that showed that they could increase urm concentration and vastly increase socio-economic diversity in incoming classes by doing two things:

1. dropping legacy
2. giving low ses applicants a 'boost' roughly equivalent to half of that received by recruited athletes 

harvard pushed back. 

why? because harvard wants to protect two things. legacy whites and rich blacks. while the urm increase in the aforementioned policy would happen, it would be driven by an increase in latino numbers from present levels and a slight decrease in black numbers.

harvard's current policy is structured to protect these two groups the most. "
275,i believe the main reason djt is pushing this is to cut back the $600 mil in federal funds. harvard can do whatever it wants if it doesn’t receive federal funds. 
276,"harvard fought very long and very hard to prevent even the tiny amount of data we have now from being released. for other ivy league schools, there is simply not much data publicly available. as of 2015, some schools, famously princeton, have even taken to pre-preemptively destroying admission files in anticipation of foia or ferpa requests."
277,"oh so this harvard case was an 'accident', like the data we have right now is a leak/unwanted release?

and does the government have the power to order the schools to give them admission files/data?"
278,"> republican war on education.

harvard has almost $40 billion in endowments, they do not need public money.  if anything, more public money should be going to community colleges and k-12.  the fact that you think harvard needs so much taxpayer money just shows how greedy the harvard community is."
279,"anti-harvard is anti-education?

&#x200b;

a king takes up large amounts of land and taxpayer money to build a pristine minuscule garden for him and a few friends with the most beautiful flowers in which to lounge by idly. once a year he let's one lucky person who is either a family friend or has worked very hard inside. everyone else lounges in infertile dirt and complains. are they anti-environment?"
280,"no, it serves multiple purposes. it encourages alumni to donate to the university, hopefully throughout multiple generations. after all: do you think john paulson's children don't deserve a little bit of favor in return for his $400 million donation? it fosters loyalty and good relationships between the university and its students' families. it also makes admission that much more special: you're not merely a student, but have been invited to become a harvard family. (that sounds weird, but it's true.) "
281,"it is the result of the current trial. the plaintiffs would like all court documents (with personal identifying information redacted) to be publicly released so to sway public opinion. harvard battled it for years, and ultimately had to release a small snippet earlier this summer by judicial order. hence all the current news stories about harvard's admissions practices.

&#x200b;

ultimately, yes. but it's not as easy as simply ""commanding"" it. i mentioned princeton earlier - last year they applied for an exemption from the doe to keep from honoring an foia request for admissions files, doe denied them, now they're engaged in a long lawsuit with the doe. ultimately after some years of battling, they will likely have to release at least small redacted snippets (assuming the files aren't destroyed - unlike medical files, there is no compelling law that mandates timing and method of storing academic files)."
282,"you typed a lot of words to basically say the same thing i did.  

>you're not merely a student, but have been invited to become a harvard family.

exactly. "
283,"i am sorry if i sound really ignorant (i'm not an american), but what was the reason harvard was on the trial in the first place? i thought the data got leaked, and that's why they were on trial, not the other way around (on trial -> ordered to release the data)."
284,oh do tell then.  harvard is a hedge fund with a school attached.
285,but why should you get both the monies from the legacy stream and federal funding? if 10% of the class is a fund-raising scheme should harvard not get 50 cents on the dollar or something?
286,"the average harvard student has about a 5% chance. a legacy applicant is reportedly 7x more likely to gain admittance. assuming that the average harvard legacy applicant is equal to the overall average harvard applicant, that is simply 35%. but in truth, the average legacy applicant is probably at least a little bit better (surprise surprise - smart successful parents are more likely to make smart successful children).

&#x200b;

the question is not are subpar legacies getting in. it is ""when only [13%](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_usc932_0.png) of asians in the top academic decile of applicants get admitted, what % of legacies in the top academic decile of applicants get admitted?"" if the answer is less than 99% i would be shocked.

&#x200b;

in reality, harvard should lose significant prestige compared to schools such as mit, caltech, and even stanford for its undemocratic admission standards. but americans seem to love dynasties. i do believe however that millenials will be less impressed with harvard  when it comes time to send their kids to college than our parents were. especially as science and tech keep ascending and harvard is seen more and more as a social science institution with strong professional graduate schools."
287,">with the college's acceptance rate, there's no chance in hell (most) legacies can get in with subpar qualifications. it's practically marketing, is what i mean to say.

yes, which is why if you want to get on the z-list, you also have to make a substantial donation.  iirc, jared kushner, a mediocre student (who isn't even a legacy student) got in due to a 2 million dollar donation from his father.  harvard is corrupt to its core.

just being a legacy student does substantially increase your chances of admissions though."
288,"i have a very vivid memory of my first week at harvard, and being alone in my room in the yard at night and hearing all the antics going on outside and feeling really crushingly alone. i'm happy to report that it does in fact get better - i can't speak for the current covid-modified freshman experience, but classes, clubs, entryways, random encounters, etc. all slowly give you friends and familiar faces without you even realizing it. of course there will be ups and downs, but don't loose sight of the fact that a lot of the ""friend groups"" that exist this early on are probably just circles of acquaintances from visitas - this may sound dumb but the only way i've ever been able to rationalize those weird early visitas friend groups is by thinking of them sort of of like micelles: balls of lipids that spontaneously orient and clump purely because of their hydrophobicity (i.e., people just don't want to be alone and group up with whomever they can). not a bad thing, but i don't know how many life-long friends are made during the first week of school. it takes time to find real friends, and it doesn't stop after freshman fall either. 

the start of school can be a difficult time for just about everyone from a social perspective. i'm sure you've heard and read things to that effect just about everywhere, but i think there are some odd factors at harvard that complicate the matter - ego and expectations of a grand experience can lead to let-downs and feelings of missing out. just keep plugging along, you'll meet some really good people (and some really annoying people) before you know it. if you're feeling really isolated, definitely reach out to room13 or some one of the other counseling resources if you need to talk things out."
289,"i'm not sure - but i do think it's helpful to remind yourself that this is not a typical year, at all. everyone i know at hc or any hu school finds their 'group' through just going to events and clubs or just hanging out in the yard...but that's during a normal year.

this year that's *way* different. much less students and a lack of student events or in-person clubs isn't helping.

so if it takes a little longer for you to find your 'group', don't be down on yourself. it's just a very unique year, to say the least.

most everyone i know has gone back home in the spring and didn't return to campus this semester  - so i'm always hanging out alone on campus, too. and it can often look like everyone has their group. so i understand.

but just remember this is only the first week and more importantly - the first week of a type of year that harvard has *never* seen before.

you'll find people. if i had any suggestions, just be as 'out and about' as you can - make small talk when you're stuck in a line at the store or a restaurant (from a safe distance, of course), ask people for directions or where to get good food just to break the ice. ask to exchange notes, let yourself get hit by a frisbee flying in the yard and ask to join.

i'm sure many here will have plenty of good suggestions for you :)"
290,i’m a first-year too. not at harvard though. i can be ur friend!
291,"wow. i guess we had the same first week at harvard. my friends and i later made a joke that it takes five people in a room (or outside or wherever) and some loud music to sound like there’s a rager going on. not everyone is out having a blast in the first few weeks, and that’s totally okay and normal."
292,surely harvard has lived through some pandemics.
293,"what a titanic visionary. immigrant attends penn, mit, and harvard and decides he doesn't really like how architecture and design are taught and handled anywhere in the upper echelons of higher learning, and so commits his entire life to making architecture that's both awesome and accessible, interesting and functional."

301,"a fun bonus of this law suit is hearing other harvard students shit on legacy admits like myself. increase my feelings of inadequacy, come on, i dare you. "
302,"it's 2 separate issues.

yes, harvard admits a lot of fucking legacy idiots like jared kushner because their families donate lots of money/are well connected, but that is indirectly, at best, related to how harvard evaluates and admit asians."
303,"it's going to do both. kavanaugh and roberts could put a sword through aa unless harvard goes the hillsdale route.

&#x200b;

which it should be able to. iirc, harvard receives about 500 million a year from the federal monies - the development office should be able to raise that yearly to cover that hole. "
304,"i respectfully disagree.

harvard is approximately 15% asian-american.  the us is approximately 5% asian-american.

harvard is approximately 6% black.  the us is approximately 12% black.

say it's your job to detect the most exceptional students in the population.  which seems more plausible - that asian-americans are 3x more naturally gifted than the average person, and black americans are 2x *less* gifted?  or that social structures make it harder for an exceptional black student to demonstrate their abilities in traditional ways?


i believe that:

(a) if exceptional people come from all races/genders/religions with equal probability, and group differences are a reflection of societal failings, a college should strive to accept the best students from each group.

(b) college education goes way beyond the classroom, and a diverse student body leads to a better education for everyone.


accepting fewer asian-americans and fewer white students, *as a percent of those that apply*, is an incredibly logical approach to building the most talented student body and the best educational environment.

"
305,"i don't think sffa will win in october in district court - there really isn't a chance for them to do so. however i can see this being appealed up to scotus. if that happens, i can see a scotus majority siding with sffa but as for how broad their decision will be - who knows.

this lawsuit was never solely about harvard. harvard is a placeholder for all schools that engage in this behavior. 

if scotus dropped the hammer on harvard via title vi, imo harvard would go the hillsdale route to preserve the quota system they currently use. 

but i could see the rest of the ivy league besides h and y having to go a lot more race blind and that would affect pretty much every school in the us outside of hys. 

&#x200b;

&#x200b;"
306,just to point out that your stats are screwy.  according to [harvard's own website] (https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/admissions-statistics) harvard is 14.6% african american and 22.2% asian american
307,"the us is 2% jewish, harvard is 25% jewish. 

are you suggesting that jewish people are 8-10x more gifted that the average population? "
308,"i must call the content of your post crap.  racial quotas and racial balancing have long beeln illegal.   
 when a university admits students who are decidedly inferior (300 sat points lower) than those who are admitted with no countervailing achievement other than ""preferred race"" to make up for that deficit, it is racial discrimination, plain and simple.  and you cannot tell me that a ""perspective from the ghetto"" is of any value in a lecture on differential equations.  the judge should ban harvard from collecting or considering any information about race or ethnicity as an appropriate remedy.

​

the elephant in the room is iq.  how can anyone keep a straight face and pin the performance of asian and jewish students on ""social privilege""?  iq has been thoroughly studied for more than 100 years and the data is there if anyone cares to look at it.

​

or feel free to pretend that everyone is of equal intelligence and that one student does better in physics than another because his parents have a country club membership.  if that were the case, then there would not be so many harvard students complaining that legacy students seem to be idiots.   why is it ok to call legady admits idiots but it is not ok to call affirmative action admits idiots?  they both got in based on something other than merit."
309,"some dirt on their raced based admissions process have been spilled, harvard was doing some sort of internal study that showed that their admissions policies were discriminatory to asians in... 2011 i believe, and they squashed the study before it could be fully completed (the plaintiffs are using this study as evidence in their case).

"
310,"harvard hasn't been 25% jewish in years.  it's only 50% white overall (i recognize that there are non-white jews, but not that many)."
311,"okay, so if your position is that some races/genders/etc are, like, genetically more gifted than others, you and i aren't going to have much to discuss.

i'm not an admissions office admin.  i'm a harvard alum who came from one of the subpoena'ed high schools, and who learned far more in the diverse environment at harvard than at my ethnically and economically homogeneous high school."
312,it's roughly 12% jewish according to hillel. harvard is 12% jewish and 38% caucasian. you can't roll them up in the same statistic. jews are not white.
313,">economically homogeneous high 

why did you bother to throw this in here lmao? let's stop pretending harvard isn't even worse about ""economic diversity""."
314,"unfortunately, you'd deny the ability of others to attend the school on the basis of merit in order to support blanket diversity while happily throwing all asians into an applicant group capped by a quota... because they're all asians, and all the same.

congratulations on having a wonderful experience during your time at harvard.  what does that have to do with discriminating against qualified applicants? "
315,"let's compare: harvard percentage of students coming from families making under 65,000/yr: 20. percentage of university of michigan students coming from families making 50,000/yr or less: 4. i realize these statistics aren't equivalent, but they give a benchmark. harvard isn't perfect, but they're doing a helluva lot better than a top state school that doesn't have affirmative action. "
316,"my high school was more homogeneous than harvard, racially and economically.  sure, harvard is absolutely not economically diverse.  but that's the comparison i have, and the one with more diversity was a better education. "
317,"there are far more qualified applicants than there is space at harvard.  lots of people are going to be denied the opportunity for all sorts of reasons.

i never said all asians are the same, of course.  only that society and the educational environment at harvard benefit from the admissions office acknowledging that race-based privilege exists."
318,"you don't see any evidence because you choose not to.  that's fine. you have that right. 

it's been a while since i applied to college, i graduated in 2012 but i don't think admissions have changed that much.

most competitive schools accept three metrics to evaluate merits of admissions. two quantitative, the sat and gpa. and another metric qualitative, the personal score which consists of what you listed above. 

here are the facts. asian americans as an applicant pool are above the mean in the quantitative metrics. asian americans have been applying to harvard in greater numbers. asian americans as a percentage of the incoming class have not reflected this change.

so what is stopping harvard from admitting more of these applicants? is it a quota that the admissions office is trying to target in the percentage of incoming asian americans or is it the qualitative metric that disadvantages these applicants?

if we see that asian american applicants have been becoming more competitive in the two quantitative metrics but are not becoming more competitive in overall admissions. all things being equal, this points to a racial bias.

as for your question of legacy admits. in a system based on equality of opportunity, of course i do not believe that should be an advantage. what i think is fair and what i think will happen are two very different things. "
319,"the numbers of all applicants applying to harvard are increasing, not just asian americans. harvard becomes an increasingly competitive school every year.

\> so what is stopping harvard from admitting more of these applicants? is it a quota that the admissions office is trying to target in the percentage of incoming asian americans or is it the qualitative metric that disadvantages these applicants?

or because other more qualified applicants determined by the qualitative measures are being accepted. not because the qualitative measures are broken.

nothing here points to racial bias yet. do you have any evidence that asian american applicants are ""becoming more competitive in the two quantitative metrics""? curious. but for all we know, other applicants could be also be becoming more competitive in those measures at the same rate. we already know the school all around is becoming more competitive every year. by the way, it is already illegal to set a quota for any race.

i think if the issue here is about fairness, attacking the legacy system should be a much more transparent issue."
320,"we can debate hypotheticals indefinitely but there's already studies on this.

https://www.unz.com/runz/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/

whether you feel the admissions percentages correspond to random chance or were university policy decisions is up to you.  however, parroting over and over that harvard is a competitive school and has lots of competitive candidates doesn't mutually exclude that they could be discriminating admissions in regards to race. "
321,not sure quite what you're responding to - but i don't disagree that meritocracy is debatable at harvard. in many of the ivys a considerable percentage of people are selected because their parents also attended (called legacy) or donated quite a lot.
322,"i've already listed discrimination, but you mean racial discrimination? i don't like how the article uses asian's americas growing population to prove there is discrimination. that doesn't seem very convincing to me. we don't know anything about the rest of the growing applicant pool and their increasing qualifications from it. we do know harvard is getting more competitive all around.

we do know harvard looks at race so there is 'racial discrimination' in that sense. the law is confusing about this epitomized by this quote:

""the supreme court has said universities cannot build a freshman class with specified percentage targets for each racial group, but it has allowed universities to consider race as a factor in admissions to obtain the benefits of a diverse student body.""

however is harvard limiting asians with racial intention? i don't see evidence for this. they do claim asians just rank low on their qualitative criteria. it would be good to compare it to other groups. however, its reasonable to assume that a larger than normal percentage of asians apply to harvard than the members of other racial groups so in that case the result would not be surprising."
323,"your takeaway from that article was that it argues there is a growing population of asians in the us?  of course that doesn't prove discrimination, it was one aspect to consider as they continued on to cover how thoroughly asian americans have dominated the top of the quantitative measures. compared to their population, they are outrageously over represented in becoming national merit semifinalists. 

you choose to ignore the sharp drop in admissions during certain years and then subsequent years maintaining those decreased admission percentages with little deviation.

i even capitulated that you don't have to believe the argument. but to look at these statistics and argue that there is no basis for which racial discrimination in regards to admissions can exist is stubborn. harvard asked the doj to throw this case out. how can we progress as a society if powerful institutions, particularly gatekeepers of future power aren't even willing to discuss if equality of opportunity is being fairly administered.  that is how policies like affirmative action ever made it to the table. 

perhaps most telling is your belief that admissions are justified because you believe asian americans must score lower in the personal score section.  yes, that's what i've been saying this whole time. this personal score section allows the admissions department great leeway in how they wish to shape the incoming class.

do you really believe these high achieving applicants aren't able to craft personable essays? that they are somehow coming off worse to admissions readers in their teacher recommendations? do you believe that as a whole asian americans just bomb the alumni interviews?

you choose to to ignore or brush aside the possibility of racial discrimination in the face of statistical evidence, yet are quick to believe that asians must score lower in the personal score therefore justifying current admissions percentages in the face of zero evidence minus the result itself.  i think that tells me enough about how you really feel about equality of opportunity. 
"
324,"i don't think anything you've listed here is evidence of racial discrimination.

as far as i can see harvard's acceptance rate has been decreasing every year except a slight bump up in 2018. so, when exactly where these decreasing admission percentages calculated?

\> do you really believe these high achieving applicants aren't able to craft personable essays? that they are somehow coming off worse to admissions readers in their teacher recommendations? do you believe that as a whole asian americans just bomb the alumni interviews?

we know that though asians represent 6% of the us, they are represented by 22% within harvard. it's highly likely a higher percentage of asians apply relative to their racial size than other groups in the us. it's absolutely likely that those applicants were not nearly as good as the other candidates in those qualitative measures - and maybe quantitative measures. of course, each student has a diverse mix of these.

it seems asians do rank well on 'objective' measures (like test scores and grades) but to assume non-racial considerations like personal statements, interviews, etc., are marked incorrectly is not firm. claiming that if someone is admitted who has lower scores than someone who was denied then the system has done something wrong is also not evident."

327,"i think harvard considers anyone who was ever enrolled to be an alum, even if they dropped out. probably for scenarios like these and bill gates :-p

edit: though https://alumni.harvard.edu/terms suggests otherwise, i've definitely heard the former as well. "
328,"i hear you. fulfillment comes from autonomously choosing goals and projects that matter to you, and seeing them through to prosperous perfection. at harvard, when people around you are constantly hitting huge benchmarks on their own projects, there's a lot of pressure to cut corners in this journey—to pick projects based on how impressive they'll look on your resumé, to achieve for the sake of achieving rather than because you care about what you're working on.

drew pendergrass just had a nice column [in *harvard* magazine](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2020/09/jhj-undergraduate-to-catch-crawdad) on this, where he proposes that pandemic isolation can be an opportunity to recalibrate your sense of rhythm and meaning by taking cues from the natural world instead of harvard's turbo-speed academic grind. that might not be your jam, but i've never regretted taking a step back to let some expectations fall away, go wander in the woods or an art museum or mt. auburn cemetery, and reconnect with my own thinking about what is and isn't important to me."
329,"if anything, the pandemic will entrench elitism because the ivory tower of academia is now even more separated from the community at large. i think it will eventually settle back into the way it was after this event dies down. institutions will always hold meaning because they are steady amongst crisis. people value that which stands the test of time. revolution, world wars, great depression, vietnam, the 60’s/70’s, 9/11, virus...and still harvard stands. 

as far as your own loneliness, i think it’s a natural feeling when you have high expectations and have made a huge life transition. challenge yourself to meet those expectations and when you sometimes fall short, give yourself permission to fail. when the pandemic is a thing of yesterday and we get back to campus, you’ll find much more solace in relationships and community. it will get better!"
330,"this was really lovely to read, thank you for taking the time out to share. 
i really resonate with stepping back and away for a while. to re-centre on what’s important. i think whatever harvard has to offer can be found at other places too and it just frustrates me that this single tiny aspect about me gives people a preconceived idea of who i am. so many permutations and combinations to why i’m at this point in my life (with healthy bouts of imposter syndrome). but largely i just find this incessant propaganda for elite american education systems in our world to be so baseless. i’m here. now what"
331,"it’s true that institutions have endured situations similar to this before but we’ve never gone through one in the digital age. information is digitally infinite (shoutout to libgen we love you). 
it takes a certain amount of self motivation, agreed, which is a yardstick if people who are at elite academic institutions —- but it doesn’t just begin and end there. literally you could just share your zoom class links with anyone at this point and they have a ‘harvard education’ too. my point is that maybe barriers to this seemingly untouchable ‘elite’ world need to be loosened and with that the participants of discourse are broader,

332,"i've only skimmed the book and seen the movie. i used to know some people who were good friends with her at harvard. even by harvard standards, i think wurtzel was kind of wild. people with far less dramatic problems still find it helpful to speak to someone.  don't be embarrassed if you seek out professional help. the counselors and therapists have heard it all."
333,"i hear your point. but, you should recognize that the reason that top consulting, ib, and law firms have such close connections to elite institutions is not necessarily because there academics are the best - which i'm sure we agree is not true. it's because they see these institution's admissions processes as weeding out individuals who do not have the grades as well as the **soft skills** (personality which can be gleaned through essays and interviews) to succeed at the highest level professionally. essentially, harvard, yale, princeton etc. do the lion's share of the vetting for these firms. i'm not sure the firms would ever want to forfeit this help."
334,"and that kids, is how i met your mother (or father? or non-binary person? all cool either way).... on r/harvard"
335,"harvard has the most money and pretty tough undergraduate admissions. it's important to remember that although most people think harvard college when they hear harvard, the college is only a fraction of what happens at harvard. a lot of the attention harvard gets is from the research it produces, which has very little to do with most of the undergraduate experience. there are several schools in the us where you can get comperable undergraduate experiences."
336,"i’m afraid i dont understand. like do you mean the school has more funding? or it cost more to pay the fees per semester, or better job opportunities because you went to harvard?"
337,"harvard has a large endowment and a large pool of alumni who contribute donations after they graduate. this large amount of money allows the school (hopefully) to invest in better libraries, labs, professors, and student life.

like others have said it’s important to not tie your value as a person to any school. having a goal like attending a top tier school is a very commendable goal. if that’s your goal. don’t let your parents or society tell you what you should want out of life.

where i differ from some opinions is that where i come from (work background) no one went to college let alone an ivy league school. so, i’ll bask in all the fucking harvard glory and everything that comes with it because i worked hard for it and no one ever expected that i would succeed at college let along harvard. 

maybe a lot of students have felt they were “at the top” of a lot of things in life. but i’ve been at the bottom for a long time and it feels good to be able to say i did this. i don’t feel a sense of guilt or privilege that oppresses me. for me it is a cool school, that’s why i decided to go here, it means something to me. 

the main point i’m trying to make is don’t do it just because it’s a cool school or because you think this is what people expect of you. and don’t tie your value to any school!"
338,"wait but like don’t you feel like accomplished and big happy that you made it to harvard, or is it like stressful and you feel like you don’t belong?"
339,"sure, but the point is that even if you don’t ‘make it to harvard’ it doesn’t mean you’re worth any less than someone who does. it’s cool to be treated like a ‘first class citizen’ and have access to the best resources / professors etc but it also can feel pointless. what you’re doing should be something you love so deeply and are passionate about where you don’t need to be validated by the big letters on the hoodie you wear that you know people are lowkey impressed by"

he has the harvard parent sticker on the back of his car too and while i understand your sentiments on things like that, behind most student accomplishments, there are parents who worked twice as hard to get their kids in a place where that's possible to get into an institution like harvard.

presumably $5k is somewhere around the ""true"" marginal dollars that harvard saves by not having someone on campus.  (since they've still got a lot of people and services they need to pay, even if students don't show up.)  i.e., not much...

obviously, there is thorny transfer pricing involved...but i assume this is roughly the math they are doing.

378,"no, you are correct--i suppose that further supports a marginal cost argument; fixed costs of ~40% don't seem that unreasonable.

of course, harvard sometimes argues that 18k doesn't reflect their true cost, anyway...so it is all murky."

384,"harvard was extremely intransigent about this—they really, *really* want to keep total control over the sexual harassment procedure. (i wonder why?) we did end up with several concessions on this, though:

* guaranteed **interim measures** pending resolution of a dispute—often all someone experiencing harassment really needs, at least in the short term, is accommodations to be separated from their harasser without ruining their career. reasonable requests along these lines are now grievable

* any form of **retaliation** for reporting harassment is now a contract violation, which can be fought with the help of a union advocate

* even though there's no third-party arbitration, there is going to be an **internal appeals panel**, theoretically more independent of the administration than title ix is, to hear complaints about identity-based harassment. when the union next negotiates a contract, this would probably be the starting point that we would try to build into a third-party process."
385,"especially since [gsas already gave us the raise](https://gsas.harvard.edu/news/stories/message-about-gsas-standard-funding-package), this feels like a bit of a money grab... what does signing this one-year stopgap contract really give students? why shouldn't we wait for hgsu to get a proper longer contract with more benefits?"
386,"this is not totally honest. [gsas](https://gsas.harvard.edu/news/stories/message-about-gsas-standard-funding-package) for example announced their 2.8% stipend increase almost a month ago, which happens regardless of whether the union contract gets signed. signing the contract gives up more than half of this increase."
387,"gsas was (perhaps deliberately) unclear about this, but the announced increase was very much part of the bargaining process. back in march, the administration had been offering 2.7%, while the union wanted much more (uconn's graduate student union got a 7% increase in their first contract, for example). then the pandemic blew up, the administration called a brief hiatus in bargaining to get a better idea of their finances, they came back offering 2.8% even though everyone else was suddenly getting a pay freeze, the union bargaining committee tentatively agreed, and shortly afterwards the administration sent out the announcement (without making any reference to the ongoing negotiations).

the way i see it, the union won me a 2.8% raise in a pandemic where the default would have been a pay freeze, and now i'm giving half of that back to help the union build power to get me a better contract in a year, when the crisis has (i hope) mostly passed. the largest slice of money from dues will go to our local for things like hiring arbitrators to adjudicate contract violations (paid equally by the union and harvard), paying union representatives to advocate for student workers who might want to file grievances and to continue to organize, etc.

and i'm sorry for being repetitive, but to be absolutely clear: you do not have to pay dues if you don't want to, regardless of how or whether you vote. you can sign an ""authorization card"" instead of a union membership card, which will give you the right to participate in the contract ratification vote without joining the union or being liable for any fees (although you wouldn't be able to elect union representatives, or have a say in how we set up our union's bylaws and administer the contract)."
388,is harvard really that bad?
389,"i didn't graduate college at harvard, and i had a very similar experience.

&#x200b;

i don't think you can expect more than that.

this happens everywhere. be prepared to meet awful people at work too.

harvard university is just that, an university.

&#x200b;

you will most likely miss it, over time. or at least some aspect of it. after i graduated, i didn't even want to go close to the location where my undergrad college is. but i do miss some of my friends. i graduated 5 years ago, and when i look back i do remember feeling **a lot** of stress. but when my friends and i look back at the experience, **together**, we laugh a lot.

i don't think i would do it again, ever, but a lot of my current life was dependent on the knowledge i accumulated there, for which i'm grateful."
390,"as another senior, i think this is very natural—especially because we're seeing so many posts about fulbrights, hoopeses, and senior awards. i'm just trying to keep in mind that those harvard arcs really are exceptional, that the vast majority of people just have the clubs, the travel, the professors, and the cool people (and most people weren't smart enough to study abroad, which was, as the cliche goes, the best decision i made at harvard). and that's totally fine. it's just one chapter of our lives."
391,"that's true i guess. i just guess i'm disappointed that my diploma is a medal and that i'll be able to leverage it for the next thing. 

but i can't get over the fact that harvard just felt like meal with randomly slapped ingredients together. i don't even feel a particular resonance with this school. it was just so random to me and it happened so fast."
392,"this is an astute observation, but isn't what i am really getting at. you're equivocating awards with satisfaction or having a larger purpose, which i think is a bad equivalency. i don't know what i wanted to do, and even if i had gotten an award, i don't see how that would have negated my experience. 

i also do not engage significantly with social media so i am not largely aware of those winning those prizes. 

the experience in it of itself was the problem, and external prizes or validation like the cool experiences i had didn't shake the feeling of impermanence at harvard each year."
393,"that's true. but even in the house, i didn't feel like i belonged. i talked to tutors, went to events, and made cool friends. but it never felt like home. it never felt like people really cared.

it's like the institutions of harvard, basically the way it was set up, was just made to move students in and out of the school. i thought i'd be excited to donate back to the school, or would be able to shoot a casual email to professors i had, but i don't feel a sense of permanence about this place."
394,"i'm not sure what that would mean. i think something i realized is that i don't regret coming to harvard because i didn't know what i was getting into. i didn't know that final clubs would leech energy out of the school, or that being on social media is important, or certain clubs had certain hierarchies. 

i don't feel that harvard wasn't social enough, it's just i didn't realize the nature of the socializing, and thus was never able to plug into it.

i dreamed of going to yale over harvard, but at this point i don't see an appreciable difference although yale's social scene is likely more accessible over harvard.

it's just weird. harvard is hard to explain."
395,"i see. i was just saying the social media/awards heightens the feeling of not having one ""thing"" that made harvard worthwhile, not that it caused that feeling, which as you say arose from the experience in itself"
396,"going to pile on the comments that a 3.7 gpa is pretty fantastic. i scraped a 3.3 in ec and life is good a few years out. i’m not sure how it works for doing advanced education, but as far as jobs go, they usually only ask “was it above 3.0?” or “was it above 3.5?”

not sure what organizations you comped, but my observation was that those are extremely difficult to pass as a frosh or even sophomore.

lastly, i can guarantee that *elis* are the last people you should be jealous of. same pressure cooker environment, just in another state (and a way shittier campus). if you’re really thinking that harvard isn’t the right place to be, maybe it’s not, but i can guarantee that the situation is not wildly better in new haven. use covid to take stock; maybe you would feel better at another school. it’s not unheard of. but if you decide to stick it out at harvard, try to focus on the positives and remember why you chose to be there in the first place."
397,"a 3.7 gpa is very good. college is what you make of it, and if you aren't vibing at h you probably wouldn't have vibed at other places. the illusion of college being some kind of ""golden years"" period is bullshit. 

we have 2 loci of control; internal (themselves) and external (environment). people have a tendency to blame bad things on external loci and give credit to good things with internal loci. flip the narrative. if you're having buyers remorse, get over it. you go to harvard. understand the level of privilege that gives you. 

also, life tends to suck in general, so, figure it out and instead of complaining, refocus on what's working and deserves more attention to make those things work even better."
398,"what's your concentration? i ask because unless you're going to like a major consulting firm or goldman or something, your gpa is less likely to matter. for example, i've been asked my gpa a total of one time in the 9 years since i graduated (and that was an interview for a job at harvard)."
399,"lol are you me??

but actually, rising senior at harvard here. trust me, i went through the exact same feelings of doubt, depression, and anger at myself for not exploring other college options for the same exact reasons that you're saying (my high school boyfriend was at yale, and i grew immensely jealous of the social experience there). i felt like you're currently feeling for a long time. i will say-- even if you can't imagine it right now, it does get much better. it took me longer than most, and i don't think i truly felt happy at harvard until my junior year, but it did happen and it will happen for you too.

dm me! i’m happy to talk. i definitely wish that i had someone to talk about this feeling with two years ago."
400,grass is always greener. i went to arizona state university for a whole year and it was hell. harvard is way cooler than yale so ultimately you made the right decision. you literally could not have made a better decision. just progress for as long and as intense as you can. it sounds to me you’re doing great with a 3.7 gpa so far. much better than my 2.7 gpa in electrical engineering.
401,"if everyone you know at yale loves it, and all of your friend hate harvard and say they should have gone to yale, then either apply to yale or consider broadening your field of friends."
402,if you transfer to yale there is a good chance you will realize that not everyone there is as happy as you think they are.  maybe take a gap year now and figure it out.  harvard is very accommodating about taking time off.
403,"if your experience has led you to have suicidal ideation, please dm me. we need you and want you here, and we need to ensure you are getting the appropriate care. ivy schools have high rates of both ideation and attempts, you aren't alone.  


you might have made a mistake. it's possible. it's hard to know when you are in the thick of school though. you didn't go to school to go to school, you went to achieve something afterward. so whether it is a mistake is going to depend on what happens *after* your school is over. why did you accept h? other than the clout, what did you actually write about in your application essays? what are your longer term goals?  


yes, the club culture can be toxic. that isn't exclusive by *any* means to h, i'm at georgetown right now and there is the same problem with undergrad clubs here. maybe clubs aren't the right fit--maybe it's something in the community that harvard has a connection to that will prove more rewarding for you.   


telling us more in an open forum is risky, i understand, so please feel free to dm if you want to talk more."
404,"college is what you make it and it’s 4 years of intense growing. i did my ugrad at a large state school. as much as i say now i loved it, there were plenty of times i was miserable. from what i’ve seen and it’s echoed here as well, all these places are the same. you learn the same things, you face the same personal challenges and you have to navigate the same life be it at harvard, princeton, state school or elsewhere. every place has their own brand of bullshit; as an undergrad we called it the ru screw (my school governing council tried to crest bolt man as a way to combat the ru screw if you want a laugh). 

i am sincerely sorry your having a hard time and if you want to talk it out, i’m here to chat! no judgements. the question if it would be better elsewhere i don’t think is a fair burden to put on yourself. there’s something to say with a bunch of achievers being stuck in a pressure cooker together, but from what i saw that’s college life. it’s okay to feel this way and your feelings are legitimate. sending some positive vibes my friend."
405,"i agree with others comment on the grass is always greener on the other side. i graduated with a 3.5 and doing really well career-wise. and if you think harvard's club recruiting is competitive, you haven't seen some of the other schools club recruiting."
406,"i don't think this counts as a mistake, it was still your choice, academically speaking it is undoubtedly a good school, when it comes to the other aspects you mentioned, you shouldn't beat yourself up so hard, life is funny that way and sometimes arbitrary circumstances determine whether we make friends or feel comfortable/loved in a place, so the reality is that there is no guarantee that you would have felt great in another university just because it wasn't harvard. but i really feel you and i understand why your mind would go to that thought, i think the best way you can deal with this void of not having had the environment and friends that you had hoped for is to look for them elsewhere and just appreciate the university for what it was and the positive it did contribute to your life. there are many ways to start making friends or find a community, the easiest way is to do it based on things you are passionate about (not necessarily your profession but it's a good option). good luck."
407,"it always helps me to put things into perspective, i would be willing to bet there were some real high points of your two years you may have left out!

if you are dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts those things likely won’t change just because you are at a different ivy. you need to reach out to a mental health professional! 

after speaking with a mental health professional it would be good to reassess your harvard."
408,"i 100% feel you on this, undergrad can be very miserable especially if you think your other friends are having more fun than you. but as for yale, one of my roommates always talked about how much happier he would be at yale and he ended up getting into a phd program there and a year later he’s back at harvard lmao. fwiw if you consider the environment of harvard and yale, harvard wins no comparison (basically it’s in the best location aside from columbia)"
409,i’ve heard the same about the other schools and actually the opposite of harvard. maybe i should reconsider where i apply
410,"hey i know i'm late to the game but i really vibed with this post. my heart goes out to you.

i went to harvard (lowell '19) because it was the cheapest option by a mile and cause, as you say, the clout. i didn't apply to any other ""top"" schools, so i didn't have to live with the regret of passing up any other great options for harvard. let me tell you though, i hated harvard. i always thought i was one of those optimistic people who could be happy anywhere, but i soon realized that being happy in cambridge is not easy. i feel you and i want you to know this feeling isn't unusual. 

the best thing i got out of harvard (apart from a handful of good friends) is a lot of mental strength. i rode harvard and i came out alright. once you graduate, every other living situation you will ever have that is not literally a turkish prison will seem wonderful and supportive. i know a lot of people from other top colleges who crumbled under the weight of grad school and young-professional life due to the lack of support or community available to them in the world outside college, but not me. hey, we survived the scorched hellscape that it blocking, house ""life,"" and finding a concentration advisor, so navigating a phd program is a dream. 

i've also accumulated a good many alumni friends since graduating and i've heard that many schools (yale, in particular) have similar social problems, but the campus culture is one that doesn't tolerate criticism. one of the cool things about harvard is that you can sit in the middle of the dining hall with your crappy brain break bagel and scream ""i hate my damn life and the resident dean is an awful person and my concentration sucks and i wish i could just dissolve into nothingness!!!"" and at least one person around you is gonna go ""lol same."" you're not forced to ""duck paddle,"" you can openly struggle and, while your useless resident dean won't give a crap, another kid might. that's rarer and more valuable than you'd think. 

also, free advice i learned the hard way: honey, if the club makes you go through an extended comp, the club doesn't deserve you. plenty of smaller clubs don't require comps. find one that gels with your interests. screw the crimson, screw the finals clubs, screw even the hoco if they make you jump through hoops.  this isn't high school. excluding people isn't cool anymore. it's immature af. 

3.7 gpa is amazing. don't feel bad. 

 most importantly: if it comes down to taking time off or hurting yourself, take time off. i lost one beloved friend to mental illness at harvard and i wish every day he'd just rejected the lie that ""time off means you've failed."" hang in there and always keep in mind that life gets better after harvard and that people love you."
411,"my two cents as a 2007 grad:  
i also couldn’t say no after ea acceptance and multiple times had significant doubts about my choice...i think most introspective and analytical people do.

i think the people that are drawn to harvard are the type that expect the best of everything, all the time.  not that yalies are any different, but there definitely is a sense from my yale friends that the “community” forged in their campus against nh almost forces them to bond in ways that harvard’s more expansive community doesn’t.   that being said, the house community becomes a wonderful enclave and i can’t imagine things being much different in a yale residential college.  also, the club scene at harvard dominates the social scene in ways similar to the societies at yale, however they’re a much larger percentage of the population over there; i would imagine this impacts social anxieties for yalies even more pervasively than at h.  

the quality of life is exceedingly high at harvard, and in many ways, the best of any ivy.  i do concede that the architecture at yale does portend a sense of gravitas that the h brick can’t match, though.  

i now am a practicing physician and loving life.  my gpa was not even close to 3.7 and even graduating in the low 3’s i was accepted to a great state medical school and ultimately the residency of my choice.   i also did a lot of extracurriculars that impacted my grades, but the breadth of resources to explore at harvard is really unparalleled.  i too was consumed with a comp, for me the lampoon, that ultimately bore fruit junior yr and believe that all the failed attempts made me a better artist- i just wanted it more.  it became the singular experience of college my senior year and made me realize another way harvard is one of a kind.  the lampoon is just magical.  

no matter what you ultimately choose to spend your energy towards, you’ve already achieved so much.  just try to soak as much in as you can.  walk or jog along the river, something your eli friends can’t do.  check out a sox game, and literally pinch yourself every few weeks because your that much closer to a degree from the “best” university in the world.  but what really matters is that college is what you make it, and it’s a challenge no matter where you go.  

harvard isn’t the end of the line, but it was for so much do your life.  now you may be searching for the next step, so reflect deeply and find a new passion and pursue it with the same fervor that earned you a spot at h."
412,"i'd like to add (and i say this in the kindest way): for your own sake, you need to accept the experience that you have had/try to make the best of them. getting quadded, getting some bad grades, and feeling down about the social experience all made me miserable for two years, but more than anything, i wish i had dealt with it more effectively for the sake of my own emotional well-being.

i don't regret coming to harvard anymore, but i massively regret allowing my circumstances to make me so sad for so long."
413,"i don't want to transfer to yale, just because i feel like it's too late at this point. i know not everyone is happy at yale, it's just hard to believe it's not a better life at harvard when all the people i know at yale love it."
414,"well it’s hard to say how it’s run now compared to then, but i know that there were definitely people who also tried many times without success.  the lampoon is a quirky and subjective comp process, and you are definitely at the whim of whoever is running the comp each semester, but i was just sharing my experience as someone who failed multiple times and eventually broke through and felt it was still worth it in the end.  the feedback is truly designed to be constructive.  harvard is definitely a competitive place, but in my experience not in a malignant way."
415,"more info: within the $2 trillion cares act, congress set aside $14 billion in  the higher education emergency relief fund to address student needs and  pandemic impacts on colleges.

“by federal formula laid out in the cares act, harvard was allocated  $8.6 million, with 50% of those funds to be reserved for grants to  students,” a harvard spokesman said in a statement. (boston herald)

i don't think trump has the authority to demand the cash back without changing the law. otherwise, it's gonna be discrimination, and harvard won't go down without a fight."
416,inb4 trump and devos withhold all federal funding from harvard
417,"non-harvard related guy here, am i right to assume this is trump demanding harvard return the money instead of harvard volunteering to return it?"
418,i'm out of the loop so i pulled up articles from [nyt](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/coronavirus-trump-harvard.html) and [the crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/22/trump-harvard-return-cares-money/) for ya.
419,"what do we think are the odds that this is payback for harvard putting out a ""roadmap to pandemic resilience"" yesterday ([discussed on morning joe](https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/harvard-report-details-steps-to-pandemic-resilience-82292293667), which trump watches) that contradicted [trump's recent insistence](https://khn.org/morning-breakout/governors-blast-trumps-claims-that-states-have-sufficient-testing-supplies-as-delusional-irresponsible/) that we have enough tests to start reopening?"
420,"the fact that shake shack, harvard and other businesses got money in the first place is what boggles my mind"
421,update: they are not taking it.  finally someone used their brain  [https://www.harvard.edu/media-relations/cares-act?utm\_source=twitter&utm\_campaign=hu-twitter-general&utm\_medium=social&mod=article\_inline](https://www.harvard.edu/media-relations/cares-act?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=hu-twitter-general&utm_medium=social&mod=article_inline)
422,">harvard won't go down without a fight.

24 hours later.

**harvard goes down without a fight.**

the orange idiot basically shamed harvard into renouncing the money.  

pretty, pretty...pretty bad..."
423,"so harvard states that they're going to use it for student financial aid. which is debt the students carry. which is secured like no other debt on the planet because of federal programs that subsidize the ""aid."" that's like offering to rescue a man in a well by giving him shovels and yelling ""dig deeper!""

universities shouldn't be playing the profit game. they shouldn't be luring children into bad contracts to secure subsidies.

universities are an atrocious joke."
424,these are not the same pools of money. harvard did not apply for money for businesses like shake shack did. harvard got money from a program in the cares act for higher education (and its all being distributed to students).
425,"yeah, so harvard is apparently operating on a gigantic deficit. you can't just dip into a restricted endowment to cover costs."
426, the money isn't even coming from the same pot. not a single small business was impacted by harvard accepting money from the higher education emergency relief fund.
427,"does this have any actual ramifications? trump does not have the authority to force harvard to do anything with this money. public anger at these allocations generally is going to be directed at trump (by democrats) or congress (by republicans) for writing a bad law, and will dissipate in a matter of weeks at most."
428,"the bailouts had to be passed quickly. there simply isn't time to dither about while the economy is on the verge of collapse. institutions that are financially sound, like harvard, have a duty to either not apply for such bailout funds or return money given to them."
429,"i don't know much about how endowments work, but i found this article helpful for understanding their situation.

[harvard's endowment](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/17/harvard-coronavirus-cfo-hollister-interview/)"
430,"i'm sure harvard had no idea about what epstein was doing. certainly harvard found out the truth at the same time the public did. even though every elite, politician, high-ranking official, and celebrity knew the truth, surely harvard didn't find out until much later.

what's this? ex-harvard president larry summers flew on the ""lolita express"" with esptein to his island and was a close friend of his?

https://www.google.com/search?q=harvard+president+larry+summers+epstein&sclient=psy-ab

you can show people the truth in their face, and they will continue to ignore it.

i don't think i need to bother providing supporting evidence for the other documents, given the problem you are suffering from doesn't seem to be a lack of evidence, but a lack of acceptance."
431,yeah... there are plenty of other businesses that need it. harvard gets a ton of money already.
432,"the public was outraged that harvard's private contractor dare to lay off dining hall staff two months earlier than usual because there were no students on campus. of course, harvard is so rich that they can just pick up the cost and pay their contractor for work that isn't being performed.

and then the few dining hall contract employees who remain in their kitchens started getting ill and harvard was again attacked by an outraged public and media for forcing these poor employees to work.

so one one end, we have the public demanding harvard pay contract workers, who are normally laid off in may, to dick around at home and on the other we have the public demanding harvard stop work for those it always elected to pay throughout this period."
433,"1) no they don't. they have a duty to do everything possible assist their employees and students. just like every other institution. coming up with good policy is the government's duty. 

2) if you look elsewhere in this thread, harvard is having various financial difficulties as a result of covid to which it can in good faith apply care act funds."
434,"it's literally illegal for a big chunk of the endowment. peer institutions regularly have to decline donations to the endowment because the contractual requirements are too strict and the faculty cannot accommodate it.

>to add to [friend], portions of the endowment are tied into formal contracts that outline what that money can and cannot be used for. some parts of the endowment are legally bound to initiatives that may no longer be active, even. 

>for example, college donor gives college $x 10-15 years ago to support scholarships for history majors/minors who write theses about constitutional history or law [0]. nobody applies for the scholarship and the faculty loses interest, but the endowment fund for the scholarship might actually grow over time as parts are tied to investments. some peer institutions decline departmental gifts and grants because the accounting and faculty administration overhead may not be worth the hassle. this is if the legal requirements are too specific, strict, or outside the scope of the department/school.

as stated by the other user, this is one of the reasons why harvard and other elite schools will harass you for unrestricted donations *until you die.*

[0] this actually happened at mit."
435,"yes and then destroy harvard now that they lose campuses, laboratories, art pieces, archeological pieces, rare literature and so on. do you think it would be a good idea for you to sell your entire car to fix a broken window?"
436,wait until this guy finds out about [harvard's ~~chemtrails~~ er...  geoengineering project](https://geoengineering.environment.harvard.edu/)
437,"it sounds like your narrative here is to push harvard into this image of an elite evil institution of some sort by showing us few bad apples from an institution that has literally tens of thousands of affiliates. i guarantee if you looked through a list of every affiliate ever to be involved with harvard you'll find people much much worse than even those mentioned in the articles you sourced, but you'll find a far greater number of incredible, intelligent and generous individuals.

even if larry summers was epsteins best friend, that doesn't mean bob loblaw, the 1l at hls is learning from a compromised curriculum and evil professors. i'm not sure what it is you want other people to accept. the things you said are true and ""accepted"". however, your conclusion isn't. i think maybe you have something to accept. is it possible that maybe, to you, harvard symbolizes a social strata opposite of where you see yourself? judging from your comment history, i think it is and i think you feel victim to that social group (the ""elites"" that ""run things"" through ""corruption"" in their ivory towers). but i'm sure you're not that much different than most of the people at harvard because most of the people at harvard are not larry summers and most of the people at harvard did not fly on the lolita express and most of the people at harvard are not corrupt. so painting the whole university with that brush doesn't seem very honest or... ""honorable.""

i should give you credit, your ""discipline"" toward getting your point across in this thread through all your replies is commendable. maybe consider changing your username from u/disciplineandhonor to simply u/discipline ?

also, please please buy uso"
438,"harvard's responsibility is to its students and employees, not to ""other businesses."" blame the federal government (congress + the president, specifically) for writing a bad law if you think the allocations are unfair, not a university for accepting what was legally granted to it under the law (not to mention during a time when it's operating under a massive deficit and is attempting to support its employees)."
439,"1) they also have a duty to be good faith actors in a bailout program.

2) harvard had to put up money to expand zoom. i see no reason why the government should foot the bill for these expenses given the generous size of their endowment. i understand most of the endowment has string attached, but there is a sizable amount of that endowment harvard can use as reserves. 

congress intended to help out struggling education institutions. i think it's fair to expect the university with the world's largest endowment to restrain itself from dipping into the fund."
440,harvard is a prime example of over indulgence though. does anyone really believe harvard is struggling with funding?
441,"an institution with the intellectual firepower of harvard has to hold itself to a higher standard than merely following the letter of the law. there are real moral and ethical concerns with a university taking money from a bailout fund for struggling education institutions when they have the world's largest endowment. 

a non-trivial amount of that endowment can be used for covering operating expenses, so save me the nonsense about all of the fund being tied up. harvard also has the wealthiest alumni network in the world. we're going to be just fine without gobbling up bailout money."
442,"it's not ""dipping into"" anything. it received the exact amount it is eligible to receive. there was no trickery, lies, or cooking the books involved, so yes harvard acted in ""good faith."" there's no definition of good faith that involves *actively refusing* money you are eligible for by law, and which was expressly given to you by law, and which you will use to support students and employees, because internet randos think you don't deserve it."
443,"nope. i’ve worked in fundraising before and legally their hands are tied. if a donor specifies that the money has to go to a certain place, it has to go there. many schools have been screwed because donors want to donate to the football team instead of giving to financial aid or stem programs. 

this is why harvard and many schools rely so heavily on unrestricted giving. most years they cover departments going over budget, building emergencies like burst pipes or fires, or are used as rainy day funds to help projects get off the ground that would never garner their own donors. but sometimes it’s the “shit has hit the fan” fund as it is this year for so many schools. no one willing wants to donate to the break glass in case of emergency fund. they want to give to the new soccer field, scholarships for kids from their hometown, or have a random bathroom stall named after them."
444,"“harvard evil cuz i can’t get in” i’m a community college student (by choice so i can money i have a high gpa) and i have no bad feelings for harvard. just because they have a lot of smug alumni doesn’t mean the institution and what it stands for sucks, if harvard university disappeared tomorrow we would all feel the vacuum."
445,"i don't know whats going on with the usual donors, but i do know that harvard spent alottt of money closing down the school since they have so many students from around the world that need to be transported and housed."
446,do you care to define what an endowment is? and do you care to explain how harvard could liquidate what they don’t have the legal right to for the specific reason they would like to do it?
447,"shucks; it didn't work. if only we could have succeeded in shutting you, the most astute free-thinker we've ever encountered, down. congratulations, you have demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt, with your three google links, that harvard as an institution is corrupt.

 i guess all the sheeple in whole world will know we're frauds now."
448,"my friend, i think you missed the point but that’s okay. the entire response hits on the “don’t let one bad apple spoil the bunch” proverb. i know you’re intelligent enough to see that. you’ll find a wide spectrum of individuals at harvard just like at any other large institution. and just like with any other institution harvard’s size, if you go there looking for an individual of a certain type you’ll probably find someone that fits that spec.

the whole university isn’t complicit in any of the things you mentioned. regardless, you’re looking for the bad apples at harvard, pulling a couple out, holding them up and yelling “hey everyone look i found this basket of rotten apples” and you’re ignoring the fact that the whole rest of the bunch is full of hundreds of thousands great crispy apples. you could do this at any institution, why you chose harvard i think is a personal issue you could use some time to reflect on on your own. many people choose harvard for this scapegoat, you’re not alone."
449,"harvard is not acting in good faith. the intent of the law was to support struggling education institutions. harvard is the most financially sound education institution in the world. merely following the letter of the law is a terribly law standard to hold harvard to, particularly during a global crisis."
450,"of course they have the money.

i'm just going to come out and say it - harvard is corrupt. that's why trump wants to take back the money. they don't need it, no one really believes they need it, and they've been up to some nasty things."
451,"yea they did. cloud services aren't free when you scale them up to the size of an entire university. zoom, pearson vue and scaling up harvards custom solutions. all of these things cost a lot money. students don't get a voucher code that says heres you new pearson or zoom account, but they get to use it as a '""tech"" tool'"
452,"and yet, harvard spent more than $5000 per college student because of the need to relocate the students and adapt the pedagogy."
453,"you'll notice if you read that, that harvard has expenses in excess of $5b each year. a significant portion of this ($2b) is covered by the endowment. when the economic environment is bad, the endowment pays out proportionately less. 


>laughable demands, coming from the guy who claimed a deficit with nothing to back it up.

given that every harvard affiliate received several emails in the immediate past from dean gay regarding the $30m deficit, it's not really necessary to cite this fact. i am curious to see your projection of this year's endowment distribution. given that revenues are quite a bit down with the cancellation of summer programming and the dreadful market dynamics of the last few months while expenditures have remained nearly constant, there would have to be quite a late fall stock market miracle for harvard to even break even. and this was the case even without the $30m hit."
454,"\> receiving money explicitly allocated to you by us government legislation that was passed by congress and signed by the president

456,"it's my understanding that the reason we're running a deficit is because of the cost of switching to online courses. i doubt fall will be canceled. it will probably be held online, as the summer school will be in a few months. i suspect keeping classes online for fall will reduce operating expenses for the university.

the real concern is with the endowment. dispersements from the endowment cover 1/3 of operating expenses. after 2008, the endowment lost 30% of its value. it slowly regained all of that and then some. the concern is that the endowment will lose value such that the annual dispersements will eat into the principle each year. this would require a sizeable decline of the entire world economy for a sustained period. even if this does happen, we have the wealthiest alumni network. i don't think funding will be an issue.

half of the 9 million has to go directly to students in financial distress. harvard should either return the other half or give all of it to students in financial distress. the 4.5m isn't going to make a difference in our long term viability. giving it back would generate a lot of good will and enhance our position as a leader during a pivotal time in a global crisis."
457,"harvard received a very large disbursement because a very large portion of its student body is very poor (i. e. eligible for pell grants, which population is the basis for the determination of the size of the award as stipulated in the law)."
458,"what does harvard accepting donations from a donor later revealed as a pedophile, a court case harvard won, and an individual professor being charged with an espionage-related crime have to do with the care act?

what about harvard accepting funding it is legally entitled to as per congressional legislation ""corrupt""?"

look i'm not going to sit here spelling out what's plain to see. it's ultimately your decision to see the truth or not."
462,"what does that have to do with anything? it's also the truth that over 20% of the student body come from literally the *poorest* recognized income bracket and pay nothing to attend.

pell grant eligible head count is what determined allocation for funds in the care act. harvard received the exact correct amount based on its quantity of pell grant-receiving students (which is a lot)."

how is harvard accepting funds it is legally entitled to under the care act corrupt?"
464,"so you don't have any actual statements to support harvard accepting cares funds as being corrupt activity. or to connect the 3 random links you posted with the care act. good to know. feel free to return when you learn to discuss above the commonly-repeated, brainwashed, cult-like level of ""[major institution] corrupt! trump'll show 'em!!! open your eyes""."
465,"the bailout fund's eligibility guidelines explicitly grant harvard $8.6 million, which it will use to support its employees and students (it is currently running a deficit doing so). if you don't like that take it up with congress and, to a lesser degree, trump. but any institution's foremost responsibility is always to its own employees (and students, for universities)."
466,there are serious moral and ethical issues at stake here. you shouldn't be content with harvard merely following the letter of the law. harvard is not in financial distress by any stretch of the imagination. we can afford to support our employees and students without bailout money.
467,"> there are serious moral and ethical issues at stake here. 

yes, and it is my opinion that harvard has no ethical or moral obligation to not accept this money, and in fact has an obligation to accept and use it (a position i outline above). you can disagree, but don't imply any position other than yours is simply failing to be ethical."
468,i disagree with them taking the money on ethical grounds. you believe they are only bound by the letter of the law. i think we should hold such a revered institution to a higher standard. harvard is financially sound. they are fully capable of supporting their employees and students without federal funds meant to help struggling institutions.
469,"perhaps it should be pointed out that harvard did not lay off any employees. their food-service subcontractor did - and now these employees are eligible for unemployment. everyone wins.

&#x200b;

this besides the fact that the endowment isn't (a) liquid or (b) unrestricted."
470,"how liquid is harvard’s endowment? every time i see posts like these i wonder how feasible it would actually be for harvard to just make payouts from their endowment, or if it would require a slow liquidation process."
471,"ok, that's very concerning, if true. especially considering harvard stands to benefit from the bailout bill. but i want a better source for this than this right wing propaganda site."
472,"if their union is happy with it, then so am i.

> unite here local 26 president-elect carlos aramayo, whose union  represents harvard dining hall workers, said he is “happy” with the  30-day paid leave policy, which will kick in next monday for harvard  university dining services staff whose dining halls have closed.

\- from the crimson article

cafeteria workers are normally furloughed when the students are not around. it happens every year, it is happening a month early this year because there is nothing to do."
473,"those are huds workers, and we're glad they're getting 30 days of paid leave as guaranteed in their union-won contract. 

the problem is for subcontracted workers at the law school. they do not have this contract protection, but the workers are equally screwed by the shutdown, and they and their allies would like to shame harvard into doing the right thing and giving them some emergency support anyway."
474,"but they also have suspended a ton of events, travel funding, etc. which means they should have cash from those. harvard is notoriously non-transparent about their finances, but i’d be willing to bet the liquid assets are there. if they were actually in some sort of financial bind where they didn’t have the cash to pay workers, they would use that as their excuse. instead they’re just saying “nah, no wages for you”."
475,"for sure it’s chaos in the harvard accounting department right now. all i’m saying is they almost definitely do have the money to pay these employees— and if they didn’t, i’d like them to clearly explain that that is the case."
476,"i believe you have every right to ask or request discounted tuition in the event of a partial experience at harvard. 

it’s not entitled behavior. one can only empathize with student’s agony of paying a hefty tuition but not getting the full experience. 

nothing wrong with that request! yes, every penny counts. bravo 👏"
477,"and just to pile on... if you don't like your harvard education, please transfer.  i'm sure somewhere else will open their labs and campus and give you that experience you need.  you'll look back years for now, when some other ivy grad gets that job you wanted, and say to yourself ""the campus experience for a semester was totally worth it""."
478,"nope.  it's not fair.  a harvard degree is a harvard degree.  why does the location of the instruction matter?  if you want a cheaper harvard degree, take extension school classes and get an extension school diploma.

a college degree isn't like a ticket to a concert where the location of your seat matters to your experience.  a degree is something that can't be revoked.  you can't un-learn your harvard education.

reduced tuition seems appropriate if you have a reduced diploma.  maybe if your ba, bs, ma, ms, phd had an asterisk that indicated you didn't really qualify for the full degree because you had remote instruction.  that seems fair.  call them ba-r, or bs-r, etc., so everyone knows you paid less and learned less."
479,i think you're missing the point of harvard if your primary focus is the diploma.
480,"... if you’re not using the space at harvard, you shouldn’t have to pay for the buildings to be maintained."
481,"if you want the harvard name on your degree, you pay the tuition bacow demands as tribute."
482,"relatively creative, yes. if they did it vs dartmouth no one would care. the harvard v yale game carries a weight outside of the ivies."
483,">almost 80 percent were self-made

that's something to be very proud of. it really defies the stereotype of ""all harvard admits come from wealthy families!"" our need-blind admissions and extremely generous financial aid sets the best & brightest minds, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, up for success."
484,"i think to assume that ""80% were self-made"" indicates that 80% came from disadvantaged backgrounds is sort of a fallacy. check out this [new york times compilation of statistics about harvard students](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/harvard-university). 67% of harvard students come from the top 20% income bracket of the u.s. **only 1.2% move from the bottom to the top quintile.** their definition of ""self-made"" only indicates that their money didn't come from their parents' inheritance. when you consider the less visible benefits that growing up in a financially stable/privileged household confers (e.g. confidence talking to authority figures/teachers/professors, access to extracurricular/interest opportunities, etc.), the 80% statistic is really not that significant."
485,"the university could just abolish legacy admissions to quiet some of that discontent.

488,"not sure i'm a fan of this -- the posts were made in private correspondence, not pinned to a dining hall wall. is harvard going to start expelling anyone who makes a shocking/offensive joke? 

another question -- would the students have been treated similarly if they had been making offensive memes about, say, milo yiannapolus? what about trump, or more generally republican lawmakers? "

490,"there is a difference between free speech and being a jerk.  the harvard admissions office clearly states that admission can be rescinded based on the moral character or lack of maturity of the candidate. 

being admitted to harvard is not a right, it is a privilege.

by your logic, cnn was wrong to dismiss kathy griffin for her decapitated trump head photo.  after all, it was ""free speech"" - right?

with rights come responsibilities.   if you want to say offensive things, that is your right.  however, people are not required to like you, let you join their private club, or be forced to agree with your offensive statements.

sadly, today, people think ""free speech"" means being able to say whatever you want, without consequence, and not only do you get to say it, but if you are a public figure, the people advertising on your program have no right to withdraw their support (infringing your free speech!). 

this is just nonsense.   these kids are not being punished for ""free speech"" - they are being punished for being *horrible people.*  and harvard doesn't need more horrible people."
491,"that was my initial reaction too, but based on the descriptions of the kinds of jokes they were making, i'm pretty sure i wouldn't want those people at my school... ribald jokes are one thing, but this stuff was beyond the pale.

i am a big freedom of speech proponent, but measures of character and maturity are rationally related to what harvard is trying to retain in putting together a class, so i believe their action is within the bounds of discretion."
492,it's pretty clear that harvard over-enrolled this year -- this was a convenient/pc way to get down to the required number. 
493,yeah but as a result they're also getting top offers for mod positions in [/r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/6fvdvj/harvard_rescinds_acceptances_for_at_least_ten/)
494,"says who? harvard asks for a ton of information that is usually considered private before they decide whether or not to admit a student. you even sign a waiver waiving your rights to this information as part of the admissions process. harvard has always judged you on your private as well as public character, so why shouldn't they expel you based on what you say in private? we're a private university, not a government body."
495,">and harvard doesn't need more horrible people.

qft. 

if the posts about the content of those messages is even 25% right, those kids need to be in counseling."
496,"where exactly did i mention ""free speech"" as a reason i wouldn't have advocated for their dismissal, or suggest that harvard doesn't have the right to do so? 

i'm not talking about students' rights, school or law-given -- harvard clearly has the prerogative to choose who matriculates. i'm just not sure it's prudent, from a school policy standpoint, that [these memes](https://thetab.com/us/2017/06/05/harvard-memes-rescinded-69413), given that they were posted in a private group, meet a standard necessitating removal from the harvard admitted student list. eldo kim is still at the school, for pete's sake! a ""one nasty joke/insult and you're gone"" policy, coupled with a consistently demonstrated administrative willingness to dig into students' private correspondence, seems like a recipe for a massively on-edge and unhappy student body. 

further, such a policy seems ripe for agenda-based abuse -- given (among other things) the school's asymmetric enforcement of the 'sgso' sanctions, would the school have been so quick to punish the posting of similarly shocking memes if they had been directed at characters less in line with the political leanings of the school's faculty and staff? i very much doubt it.

"
497,"i agree that trump and yiannopoulos are bags of shit, but i'm a little hesitant to say that hostility toward any one group is *more* or *less* warranted... i kind of feel like that gives people carte blanche to say, ""well it's not *as bad* to show hostility toward certain groups of people based on their sex, religious views, or unpopular political viewpoints."" not exactly encouraging constructive dialogue, is it? in terms of how to treat people who are different or whom you don't agree with? even toward people who hold viewpoints that any reasonable person can agree are morally loathsome, such as racism?

(by the way, i think harvard was within their rights to rescind offers in this case. most of us - myself included - have made inappropriate comments and jokes, but these jokes sound pretty sick and demented.)"
498,i don't think you realize how accepting harvard is of views that differ from what may be the status quo at the university. 
499,"its not serious. imagine a harvard dean overhears you telling a racist joke to your friend. you are not racist - its simply a joke on stereotypes. i know its hard to descern whos serious or not, but theses memes were so offensive it had to be a joke. "
500,"well,  i for one believe that harvard should stand for and support political views that encourage liberal humanism. in fact, i would argue the school has to do so if it wants to maintain the diverse student body that has made it so attractive as a place of higher education - i know many other minority/international students who turned down offers from other ivy leagues because they felt that campus culture was not as welcoming of students who did not fit the traditional ""white, male, american"" mould. let's not forget that it hasn't been that long since the days when the houses were basically racially segregated, with all international and minority students living in the quad. 

also, just fyi, eldo's no longer studying at harvard."
501,"it's also worth noting that there are more grey areas when a public university is involved, since that can be tenuously considered as punitive action by the government. but harvard is not a public university, so it's _definitely_ not a 1st amendment issue.

(mit grad here, i showed up because i heard about this incident and figured /r/harvard would be taking about it. glad to see that people's reactions are mostly reasonable, except for the upvotes to rgsii's whataboutism)"
502,"omg its a fucking joke?! i'm a bernie sanders supporter, but i enjoy a good offensive meme. does that make me racist?? does that mean that i don't support a ""liberal agenda""???? no. it doesn't. quite frankly, all this does is add to the alt-rights argument that liberals hate free speech. this does nothing to help liberals except make us look like a bunch a pussies that complain when we see something we don't like. so what if these students made offensive memes?? their political views should not be a deciding factor for whether they are allowed into harvard. harvard might have the right to do this, but god damn does it show how fucking weak neoliberales are. instead of allowing people into a institution based on merit and hard work, ultimately it's who they wanted to win the election that matters. fuck you for defending this bullshit, and fuck anyone else that does too. "
503,"had a little bit of hard time following here, but i think i see what you mean. i just meant that i wouldn't create a hierarchy of moral outrage. from what i've seen, liberal outrage over more conservative viewpoints on issues such as social issues has backed a lot of moderates/conservatives into corners and has made them cling even more to defending outrageous behavior by people such as trump.

(but i'll again reiterate that i think harvard was within their rights to rescind these admissions offers.)"
504,"i don't care about the alt-right, and i don't care about sanders. i'm not even american, and if i were i don't think you'd describe most of my political views as ""left wing"". all i know is i wouldn't have gone to a school whose students felt okay joking about stuff like ""slitty-eyed chinks"", and i'm pretty sure jewish students would think twice about going to a school whose students joked about the holocaust. diversity is one of harvard's traditional strengths, and if we want to preserve it then we absolutely should stop certain political beliefs from being present at our school.

oh, and here's a meme you should be familiar with: go finish your chicken tendies, kid, not everything is about you."
505,"it's definitely a real feeling. i find it helpful to decide what i want, and then ignore what everyone else is doing (academic- and career-wise) as much as possible. i also remind myself that success is not a zero-sum game. your classmates are not your rivals; they're your peers, and you can learn from them. that said, i think it's healthy (and interesting!) to surround myself with people who have interests and ambitions very different than my own. like if you're pre-med, maybe don't always hang out with the other pre-meds, y'know? it helps a little with comparing yourself to others, which is always a losing battle.

other times i'll catch myself feeling jealous of a friend getting some cushy  job or something like that, and then have to take a step back and think, ""i literally would rather cut off my right arm than do something like this."" we're just conditioned to value certain paths/careers over others, and i've had to do a lot of deconditioning, if you will, at harvard."
506,"picture the dumbest person you know at harvard. if s/he can be a student at harvard, so can you."
507,"i dealt with this same exact problem for months. 

you’ll come to find that most, if not all, harvard students deal with imposters syndrome. it’s why we’re here. harvard saw something in us and took a chance on us. 

most of us are over achievers and are very hard on ourselves. personally, i’m constantly comparing myself to my peers and competing to be the best. when i’m not the best, i feel like a failure. 

what helps is talking with my peers. they’re all going through the same thing whether it appears that way or not. 


you’ll be okay."
508,"i don't. i just live with it. 

in harvard or anywhere else, very few people have actually achieved things on their own to justify the incredible amount of financial and intellectual capital available to them at harvard. for most of us, it's privilege, luck, and making use of the opportunities we get. 

i think almost everyone understands this fact - and it is a type of impostor syndrome. i hope more would internalize it."
509,"there are very few supergeniuses at harvard (at least there weren't when i was an undergrad, which was... not that recently?  maybe things have changed).  there aren't even that many super-achievers.  it feels like there are, but in my experience, the super-achievers aren't actually all that smart; they just put in a lot of effort.  harvard admissions can generally see through that.  what super-achieving *has* happened is generally more a product of educational opportunities -- motivated parents with lots of free time, fucktons of money, a really excellent school system -- and not *really* personal excellence of some sort.  again, there definitely *are* supergeniuses, just not as many as you think.  most harvard students are actually pretty normal, just generally smart, probably like you.  for every famous musician or actor or imo gold medalist there's dozens of people who love learning and are really good at it but aren't superstars.  that's a really big ratio relative to almost anywhere else in the world, which is one of the reasons people want to come to harvard in the first place, but those supergeniuses are still a very small minority.  when i first came to harvard, i thought i was one of the least qualified students on campus, but i quickly realized that this just wasn't true at all.  i don't know what things are like now, but as a math guy, i was absolutely *not* going to take math 55, holy fuck no, i'm not a supergenius!  but when i ended up with one of the two highest grades in math 25 in my year, i realized that, well, i may not be a supergenius, but i'm still pretty good at this math thing, right?  (i guess probably could have taken 55.  i didn't particularly want to find out.)  i'm sure you have something *you're* pretty good at, or you wouldn't be at harvard.  most people at harvard are probably not that good at the thing you're good at, because they're good at other things instead.  and that's ok!  the way i see it, if you can handle the courses, you're fine.

the other side of this is that you *can't* handle the courses, you really aren't fine, and you probably shouldn't be at harvard.  impostor syndrome is only a syndrome when it's not real.  like, if you feel like you're an impostor *and you actually are*, you should, you know, reorient your expectations."
510,"so i’m from oxford and about to apply for a harvard phd. my 2 cents: it’s what you do with it. it motivated me to study even harder, so i ended up with distinctions. i honestly think it’s an asset, because it motivates one to be better. contentment terrifies me"
511,this is very toxic way of thinking... then do you feel better as you think about poor and malnutrition kids in africa? i’d love to read your college application essay where you probably said “i would like to make a positive impact in this world” lmao harvard should come up with a better application screening system 🤦‍♂️
512,"i mean if anything, doesn’t that make you more entitled (even though i have no idea who you are), because you got in cause you’re smart or talented, not because you’re rich, but because you deserve it and worked hard to get there. (i don’t mean this to be offensive in anyway :)

 (oh and i’m not actually in harvard (\*\*\*yet) btw i’m in 10th grade but i want to go there very badly)"
513,">this is very toxic way of thinking... then do you feel better as you think about poor and malnutrition kids in africa? i’d love to read your college application essay where you probably said “i would like to make a positive impact in this world” lmao harvard should come up with a better application screening system 🤦‍♂️

i fear for what /r/harvard has in its awesome memes war chest. this post should have never been made. it is as if lord nito unleashed a miasma of shitposting and cringe.

i hope /r/uoft survives the onslaught of the memes from /r/harvard."
518,isn't waterloo the harvard of canada? 
519,"i'm actually very happy with the way harvard has handled the situation. i still think the campus shouldn't reopen, but i get why they're doing this the way they are. i just hope they can successfully manage those who will stay there and avoid a major outbreak."
520,harvard’s a shitshow too. we just don’t have martha to meme on so there is less dissent on reddit.
521,"“is harvard a sh*tshow too?” 

why yes...yes it is.

virtually (pun intended) everyone knows at least one student that plans to take a semester/the year off and work on a project."
522,"jfyi to harvard. 

yes, the communication has been brilliant about campus opening for freshmen and making all safety arrangements. 

but the online chat-groups have a totally different plan. 

many are discussing about exploring boston, restaurants, life and culture. they are looking forward to all sorts of activities. 

local boston community has done very well in controlling the infection & spread. 

i just hope harvard can contain the new bursts of joy, adventure and adrenaline! 

it can only happen when each student sees it as a ‘personal responsibility’ for full 10 weeks to neither carry nor spread the infection. 

harvard must have successful outcomes from opening this fall!!"
523,"the problem clearly is your choice of school. harvard is handling all items well. the admissions folks return phone calls, the extension school is showing harvard college professors how to use zoom, and students located all over the globe regularly zoom-into classes, and have for years...

mr andy bernard..."
524,"as a grad student working in a lab, harvard has done a wonderful job on the testing front all summer. hoping the move to self-testing is as smooth."
525,"i haven't met a single cornell student who would say that about cornell, so 10 points to harvard!"
526,"it's just my interpretation of the situation, but i think they're going allow freshmen on campus to give them at least a bit of the harvard experience. with roughly 20% of freshmen deferring their enrollment, it's understandable that harvard wants to do something to stabilize the situation. the harvard experience heavily revolves around our campus, and while things won't be nearly as enjoyable and lots of things are closed down, being there can still be impactful for our newcomers and can help them adjust to the situation more easily."
527,"too much control i would say. i’m not in charge of course but since you asked for my opinion, i wish they would implement a combo of occupancy restrictions/testing/tracing/distancing/hybrid classes like yale, columbia, and cornell did. i’m not a fan of shutting it down and going online only. it’s a piss poor way to get an education, much less an elite one. just my two cents. 

i will concede that harvard has been great with clear communication about the plans though."
528,"i think both cornell and harvards plans are going to result in piss poor education. it's  a matter of trying to balance the cost of peoples lives, health, livelihoods and future. its not an easy equation to solve, and i don't know what a fair trade-off is."
529,"if you can study the preferences received by whites, none of which are race-specific, you should also ask ""what percent of harvard's black and hispanic students would not have been admitted without racial preferences?"""
530,"kidding aside, the author of this report is using this data to argue against having varsity athletes at harvard.  but this 43% statistic is deceiving.  that percentage should be expected to go up any time harvard diversity increases because the decline in the number of white students will mostly effect non-athlete and non-legacy whites.  in other words, this number reflects an effort to diversify, not an effort to give preference.  stanford just dropped 11 varsity teams.  that will hurt stanford’s reputation.   it will also decrease their yield.  but that is just a function the student/recruit mix.  number games ."
531,"and i therefore refer you to my answer. just enjoy a free article, well written and relevant to your experiences at harvard in many ways. maybe even share it with your friends if you enjoy it. i don't want anything from you beyond that.   


all the best."

534,"hang in there, remember you can reach out to residential staff and advisors or peer support groups like room 13 if you need to. these aren't substitutes for professional help, though, and it's a crying shame that student mental health care services are so stingy.

one of the reasons the grad student union is threatening a strike is that the union is asking for huhs to hire more mental health specialists or cover more off-campus providers, but so far harvard has refused to negotiate on this at all...on the grounds that “if we improve[d] health care for graduate students in the bargaining unit, we would have to improve it for all students.” [source](http://harvardgradunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/status-of-bargaining-october-2019.pdf)

then you go home"
536,boston is the largest and most diverse college town in the world. i think branching out to social scenes different from the ones you've been experiencing your 1st semester is a good idea. whether that's different social groups within harvard or other universities (disclaimer: am mit student).
537,"yes dating is weird at harvard. yes you should branch out now. don't feel funny about getting serious with someone soon. i met my wife freshman year, we were told constantly to not take it seriously. to date around. rely more on a social network of friends than eachother. that was about 15 years ago. those people are entering their late 30s single and with few prospects. finding someone at your age is important. branch out and take it seriously. don't measure your life by as achieved, measure it by the depth of your relationships. you're at harvard. graduate and you're going to be okay. find someone who will take you seriously and who you can depend on, because it is just the two of you in the wilderness when it comes down to it. i'd suggest looking at intercollegiate events, volunteering, or getting away from harvard people to date seriously. it is very hard to date other harvard people and have long term positive outcomes. it happens, but it's rare.

538,"harvard is full of individuals who have surprisingly little to no interest in relationships, as they are too involved in pursuing their career and academic orientated goals, even if they might not openly acknowledge it. of course there are many types of people present on campus, all with varying backgrounds and life stories and what not, but i have to agree with you that from what i've seen the dating climate is pretty lame. others will object, but all in all, just wait for that single person to come along one day who will truly open up their heart to you and genuinely love you. those who are tough to please, those who are too involved with themselves, are not worth chasing. a real relationship is not meant to be chased, but to flow naturally and fall into place with beauty and grace. i say this not making any assumptions about your situation but from the mistakes i've made in the past, wasting my time worrying about relationships when what i needed to do all along was focus on loving and improving myself, so that i can be the best boyfriend i can be when the time comes that i finally meet that special someone."
539,any advice on places to go/ways to connect with people outside of harvard at other schools?
540,"with the exception of my now wife, point 0 for me was always from off campus roommates. i only have one good friend i made during my time in boston not from school/clubs who wasn't at least a third degree connection with one of my roommates. that was someone studying for the toefl at the time that i randomly met at the starbucks in harvard square. i've heard good things about volunteering/group activities (i.e. sports)/meetup.com/religious organizations."
541,"yeah. harvard seems super bizarre to me in this respect; it's very tolerant and lgbtq+ supportive, but at the same time the actually community just isn't here. we basically don't even have an active lgbtq+ group. i don't know what happened"
542,maybe harvard's contract has language prohibiting this.
543,"interesting. my admittedly baseless speculations are mostly informed by what other colleges have been doing. i think seniors would only have priority in the spring, since it would be their last semester. i think it's crucial for first year to be on campus in the fall however, since i think it would cause irreplaceable damage on their harvard experience if they have to meet fellow class mates online. besides, they need to minimize any potential gap years from first years, since that would automatically translate as pressure on the class size for next year. housing in the yard is already very limited"

547,"it's fine. probably not worth the administrative hassle? lots of people got enough 5s, etc. to get advanced standing and didn't do anything with it, me included.  harvard courses are definitely tougher to get an a in than than it is to get a 5 on an ap.

554,"i don’t like it. i had a couple take photos of me walking into widener.

one time, there were two parents and a daughter (maybe 14 max). one of them pointed to me and told their daughter “i want you to be like him when you grow up”. this also happened outside widener. while this is the parents fault, i felt really bad for the kid. pretty messed up when harvard turns you into a zoo animal.

556,"people like to complain about it, and it can definitely be annoying when i'm in a hurry to get to class. 

but it feels kind of douchey to resent people who come from halfway around the world just to get a peek at the privilege we enjoy every day. peeing on the foot that little kids touch all day is definitely a dick move. and a big part of the value of a harvard degree comes from the fact that a lot of people fetishize this place, so i try not to sneer at them for it."
557,"it is like that at all the ivies i've personally visited. giant groups of asian tourists and scattered others. i'm not sure it they come to see the buildings and campus or to stare at zee smart people. you do get a few hard stares when you swipe in somewhere and people realize you're a student. they've had to post signs asking people not to trespass into buildings or stare into rooms.

576,"^ironically, the amount of downvotes on this post just goes to confirm how accurate it is. go look at the mean standardized test scores/gpa for native americans and compare it to white, nigerian, or asian students’. the sad part is that there’s nothing negative being implied in affirmative action alone. harvard wants diversity, and you contribute to it so you deserve to be here. it’s just these people making the big deal out of it themselves claiming that everyone deserves to be admitted for academics."
577,"harvard knows they have a powerful brand and that this would be the byproduct of them naming their programs like they have. 

don’t sweat it.  remember that the real prestigious people are the ones that build great things, not the ones with great school names on their resumes. 

it’s been said before and worth saying again: “people don’t care who you are, they care what you’ve built.”"
578,"over time as an undergraduate at harvard, i realized a lot of us felt like frauds at one time or another. there was a good article in the gazette about it (or maybe the magazine (?) ), several years ago. a good percentage of dudley house people ( transfers ) had similar feelings also in spite of the fact that it's very hard to be able to transfer in.  not unusual. glad you're a part of the community!"

580,">	don’t get the impression that i’m anywhere near the level of a harvard college graduate

i legitimately don’t know what this means... i can see it mattering in academia but perhaps even then it’s all so much more about the quality of work once you’re a couple of years out of school.

do good work in your field, look back fondly on your classes and professors, and let everyone’s misconceptions be their problem instead of yours. i didn’t go to the es, but i know many exceptionally bright and insightful folks who did."
581,"me, i'm pretty proud of my work at the extension school. it's why i'm able to steer my career the way i have done recently, and i'm highly satisfied.

but, you know, a lot of prestigious programs and schools are very oversold, and so you can seriously delude yourself into thinking the future is guaranteed to be brighter than it actually turns out to be, if you're not careful. i did that when i pursued my mba at uchicago years ago. great education but, eh, i could have done without it.

i'd say just focus on your work and don't worry about who thinks what about whatever. if someone asks where you went to school, just tell them you went to harvard or harvard extension school if you feel like it and let it go. wherever you went to college, whether it's harvard college, yale, brown, oxford, or timbuktu, it pales in comparison to what you do with that education."
582,"you aren’t a fraud; you got an alternative degree from a continuing education program. just tell people you went to the harvard extension school and call it a day. don’t tell them you went to harvard because that implies you attended the university proper. if you are honest about your status and someone misinterprets you, that’s their fault.

two weeks ago i saw a dude proudly walking around tercentenary theatre wearing a sweater that said “harvard extension school” with the university crest on it. be that guy."
583,"this is very true. the education at hes is pretty challenging but you will have haters. this goes with everything else in life. what counts more isn't that you did your ug work at hes and all that entails but also your application of your education to your career path. hes is a great resource for working adults and is just a different educational path at harvard. lots of folks will nitpick whether it is harvard college or not but, to be honest, hiring managers don't give a shit because they will focus more on what you've done over time rather than where you went to school."
584,"i mean... my two cents, it is worth it if you go there and are willing to work really hard. the work is just no joke. if you can achieve high grades, you can go on to some pretty amazing places. the professors are so kind, and down to earth, and teach so well, it's a truly remarkable opportunity. the low cost is also such a huge benefit. they could legitimately charge $50,000 a year to attend if they wanted to, and people would pay it! but they're genuinely true to the spirit in which the school was founded. 

but at least for me, it's such a rollercoaster just trying to explain where i went to school. and like i said in the original post, it is absolutely bizarre to say to someone, ""i didn't go to harvard college, i went to harvard extension,"" and then it's like (at least to me) if they aren't disappointed, i feel like a con artist. like, no, you're giving me too much credit. it's like if i don't down myself to people, i feel like a complete fraud. so even if it meant going to a school where i wasn't challenged, i'd still do so just so it wasn't a big issue when i told people where i went to school. 

so for example, i did a traditional master's program at another school after i completed my alb. when people ask where i went to do my master's degree, i just say the name of the school. not, ""i went to such-and-such university, faculty of english literature, etc. etc."" my degree just says ""ma in english."" not ""master of liberal arts in extension studies."" employers aren't confused at what subject i studied.

it's such a relief not to have all the extra stuff. with the extension school, it's like someone asks me where i went and it's like i have to spend three paragraphs explaining how i got my degree. and i feel like i have to put myself down in order to do it. and if i don't put myself down, and they have some idea in their mind that i must have gone to harvard as in harvard college, i end up literally feeling like a con artist. 

and here's the other catch -- if someone misunderstands where you went to school, they'll tell other people, ""hey, this guy went to harvard!"" and then you have to explain to *those* people you didn't go to the college, etc. etc. 

so for example, i remember after i graduated i interviewed for an internship. the subject of my degree never came up, but once the person who interviewed me hired me, she walked around the office saying, ""he went to harvard."" i'd listed my degree the right way on my resume and everything. and i was so ashamed to correct her in case she thought i was trying to fool her that i didn't speak up and say anything. i felt so awful that i ended up leaving the position."
585,"you may have heard of this “ape.”  he is also a harvard member, [his name is mark zuckerburg](http://thequotes.in/people-dont-care-about-what-you-say-they-care-about-what-you-build-mark-zuckerberg/)"
586,"largely the same professors as the other colleges at harvard university. it's not like you get bunker hill cc profs just teaching hes classes. 

one of the main differences is that you need to maintain a higher gpa to continue in the studies and graduate. a hks polisci graduate can float by with a 2.5 gpa. you could not."
587,"exactly, and other issue is when they are in harvard/princeton/etc, they are going to suffer because they didn’t learn anything of value in high school. it’s quite unfortunate for these kids.

does the college have the right to expel students if they lied on their college application post-enrollment?"

597,"if harvard's defense is that asian applicants rank lower on personality traits and this is the root cause of a lower than otherwise expected admissions rate, and the plaintiffs choose to meet them head on regarding this point, which it seems they want to do, then the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that asian applicants as a group are objectively not weaker in this category. 

based on an inexperienced reading of their filing (ianal) it does not appear that they have done this. rather instead, they have demonstrated that asian applicants receive lower scores in this area, (using some definitely janky non-standard mathematics, but harvard does not really dispute it) and then imply that because these ratings are subjective, they must be lower as a result of discrimination. they dismiss out of hand harvard's witness's contention that asian applicants are actually weaker in this category, calling it, ""offensive racial sterotyping... legally and factually untenable."" stereotyping or not, they have to prove it to be false, and that's actually really really hard to do. 

quotes from leadership who are not directly involved in admissions are not weighty, and it is not hard to think of explanations for why admissions-office ratings can differ from alumni-interviewer ratings. instead, the plaintiffs try to push the burden of proof onto the defendant, asking harvard's witness to present a non-race explanation for the lower personality trait scores. while his refusal to do so constitutes a weak defense, it is still plausibly coherent, and the plaintiffs must pierce it themselves. if they are unable to do so, then i'm not sure they have much of a case. 

***

sideways from the legal stuff, it is clear that harvard has a system that they implement that consistently produces the student body that they desire. the plaintiffs believe that the process should be different, resulting in a different student body composition. who gets to make that kind of decision, and how much control should the government have over it? these are some really interesting questions that are going to get answered as all of this plays out. "
598,"so i'm one of those asians with a  perfect sat score, high class rank + national level competitions/ extracurriculars in math and the social sciences, that likely got rejected due to  the caps 10 years ago. also i didn't realize it until college but my family was dirt poor compared to my peers (waiter + post-doc salary).  


ultimately all the ivies rejected me but luckily i got into another school with similar but not quite as  good career outcomes (like 25&#37; of class goes to ibanking and management  consulting vs like 40&#37; at harvard or princeton). in particular i remember my  upenn alumni interview went really really well and i was devastated when  i was waitlisted. also was bitter for a while because cornell didn't take  me but took my best friend who was an a- student with 300 pts lower on the sat than me but white.  
10 years later none of this matters much to my career but i can't help but think how different my future would've looked if i went to a non-target school instead. i likely would've ended up pursuing a career in engineering or medicine as opposed to finance simply because the recruiting networks weren't there.   
if edward blum wins his case and proves there were racial quotas of around  20&#37; of class for asian americans at most super-selective colleges, will there be class action lawsuits that harmed students can sign up for?  
also do yall think this would shift the dial on mba admissions at hbs? i would be very happy if the courts forced universities to publish similar data for their business school with race + gender that something reputable like propublica or brookings can dive into and analyze. based on facebook posts (not a great representative sample which is why i want official data) i have like \~10 female asian finance/consulting friends who've gotten into hbs or stanford gsb in recent years vs like \~0 asian males with similar careers (but the asian guys are still getting into other schools like michigan or booth).

599,"if harvard is a private university, shouldn't it be allowed to discriminate in its application process if it wants?  or is it like a private company where all applicants must be given equal measure?"

"
601,i feel like you can’t ever fully show something like that. they did some statistical analysis but of course harvard talked about other factors that weren’t taken into consideration
602,"there are certain groups that are protected understand as federal civil rights law from discrimination. and race is one of those groups, regardless of whether you're a public institution or private. it's why we don't have whites only stores anymore.

however, college admissions get fuzzier. this issue first came up in light of affirmative action, when a white student sued saying she wasn't admitted because of affirmative action for racial minorities. courts ruled that a university (public in that case) could consider race in admissions to create a more diverse group of students, the argument being that this was beneficial for the members of the cohort.

but there a couple of significant differences. that was a state school, and the plaintiff was white. here, those suing harvard are minorities in the general population, though over-represented in the applicant pool relative to that. to throw another wrench in the mix, there are some right wing groups pushing/promoting this case in get of abolishing affirmative action altogether."
603,"my understanding is that harvard is free to discriminate, but it would have to give up access to federal funds like student loans. maybe they'll bite the bullet and give up the funds in the name of diversity; their endowment can support them for ages on its own.  unlikely but who can tell what'll happen these days."
604,"is the claim inherently racist? i don't think so. i think it *may* be, but is not necessarily so. 

the plaintiff filing argues that asian applicants as a group get stronger academic scores than white/black/hispanic applicants. the implication is that this is fair because asians are objectively stronger in this category. how come this statement is accepted as not racist against the academically weaker white/black/hispanic groups? is it just because there is evidence for it, so we know it to be true? 

the main difference between the situation of the academic score and that of the personality score is that we are able to point at corroborating data for the academic score. there is no such point of reference for the personality score (potentially intentional on harvard's part to make it easier to defend), so it could be true, or it could be bullshit. if it's bullshit, then it's racist. but if it's true, then it's just like the academic score, which the plaintiffs definitely don't think is racist, right? 

edit: now, do i personally think asian applicants are objectively weaker in the personality category? no, outside of seeing reliable data that tells me differently, my default stance is that they are not. this is corroborated by the information the defense has provided from alumni interviewers and high school counselors. however, this is not a preponderance of evidence, and harvard's assertion that there may be intangibles hidden in things like personal statement essays (which we maybe conveniently don't have access to) is at least plausible, even though it's far from definitive. ironically, the closest thing we have to actual data in this regard are the disputed personality scores. 

i do not think either side is doing a very good job. however, since the legal burden of persuasion lies with the plaintiffs who are bringing the claim that harvard is discriminatory (different from evidential burden, which shifts from party to party based on claims brought), they need to do a better job in order to win.

i have no idea what things are like now because i'm old, and i have even less idea what things are like now because of covid, but if they're at all similar to when i was an incoming freshman, there will be *plenty* of help on hand to guide you in figuring out which math courses to take.  55 might be for you, or it might not.  good luck!"
623,"generally, if you do undergrad at h, you are discouraged to do grad school at h unless it is in hbs, hks, hms, hls.

also, harvard’s math department is gorgeous. profs are awesome, community is awesome, classes are awesome. probably, the best math department in the world.

edit: what i said above applies to fas grad school which includes math. harvard wants you to explore labs other than your undergrad lab."
624,">the reason is that they want you to explore other places and do math somewhere else. 

i didn't go to harvard for undergrad but my own alma mater math dept highly recommended doing grad school somewhere other than the undergrad institution, which was still a very solid program."
625,lmao what? i know lots of people who have gotten their md/jd along with an undergrad at harvard. unless that’s what hbs and hks mysteriously stands for?
626,"i think this only holds true for phd pathways, where you’re generally always encouraged to do you phd elsewhere. harvard does seem to be the school that makes the most exceptions, they love taking their undergrads to phd programs (anecdotal! i don’t have any statistics on this lol).

i’ve heard rumors that 25% of hms is made up of harvard college graduates."
627,"maybe i should have added more qualifiers but you cannot do college and phd for things like math, physics, cs, stats, etc. harvard wants you to explore different labs before maybe coming back. i should have written fas i guess, but my previous comment addresses op's post anyways. so, please don't butcher my karma."
628,"just to clarify on behalf of uniformlyconvergent, hms is harvard medical school (so, md) and hls is harvard law school (jd). many people do stay for med/law/business (hbs) degrees"
629,"this is true, but i think harvard is the one school where this is the exception. many phd students in econ and hbs that are from the college."
630,"why though? wouldn’t they want students who are prepared for the grad school ”their way”? and also, if you get an undergrad from harvard and then go to some state university, no job is gonna care that you went to harvard unless you’re not applying using the phd merit"
631,why am i being downvoted lmao? i’m simply asking a question stating what i presumed to be the case open to be proven wrong. seems that most people here aren’t close to be qualified for harvard...
632,"there are many state universities who are much stronger than harvard in certain specialized areas. most people don't choose phd programs based on general name recognition; they choose based on research reputation in their specific area.

here's an example from my field: if you are applying for math phd's and wanted to do your phd in graph theory, it would be very dumb to go to harvard. you would get far better job prospects if you went to, say, university of illinois, which has one of the strongest graph theory programs in the world."
633,"see my edit above.

also, yes that generally helps. but harvard can't do everything. there are so many sub-fields in each area of science that one university can't possibly be good at all of them. this is true for any of the top universities. the fact is that, at a phd level, the research is so specialized and fine-grained, each university develops its own areas of specialty. and often relatively unknown (""state schools"") places hire people that are very talented at a specific area. if that happens to be your area of interest, then that's probably where you should go! 

your phd advisor usually weighs much heavier than where you got your phd, because when people are looking to hire you for your expertise, they don't care about the name; they care about the research you did and if it was with someone well-known. 

once again, harvard has many well-known faculty and has some of the most esteemed and expert researchers in the world. but that doesn't mean it automatically outweighs a state school. it depends on what area the phd is in and what sub-field it is."

635,harvard broke my heart
636,"it's a school of harvard that allows working professionals to take classes either in the evening or online... or even just during the day. anyone can take extension school classes but to get into a degree program you must take two degree specific classes and pass with a b or higher. then you can apply to a degree program by submitting an essay and taking some english proficiency tests. all degree programs have an on campus requirement, though some degrees require more time on campus than others. the percentage of graduates from the extension school is pretty low but not everyone in the extension school is trying to get a degree. however, even of people polled from their first classes that stated they wanted to get a degree, very few of them finished. if you want i can try to pull the sources for you."

i'm just curious because i suspect my school will have to do something similar, but the terminology used is often so vague."
641,"the legacy situation is tricky. i went as a legacy to my parents alma mater(not harvard). i had straight as and all the required stuff on my resume to get in but nothing super exceptional like being all state in a sport or having some obscure minority status. i got in, loved my time there, my parents feel more of a shared connection with the school now. i can even say that if my child one day was well qualified and they rejected them, they can forget about any donations or me helping the school out as an alumni. this is what they are worried about. having a strong alumni network is hugely important for many reasons. having a bunch of alumni who feel slighted right around when their career potential at its peak is horrible for a school.

&#x200b;

my parents friends had a daughter who was rejected despite having a resume pretty much the same as mine. they are both powerful doctors and they will never donate, attend a school game, alumni weekend, ever again.

"
645,"i'm sorry to hear that. if i could offer some advice, you are certainly not alone. almost everyone experiences these feelings to a degree (especially at harvard). the way i overcame some of these thoughts was to change smaller things before changing bigger things (e.g. the way you walk to class, the food you eat, the places you study). after enough small changes, the big changes come easier. 

i would also encourage you to reach out to uhs mental health services if you feel you would benefit from their help. they are really professional and they can make a big difference. "
646,"harvard can be strange and intense at times. as others have pointed out, a lot of us have felt this way at some point or another so you're not alone, but you also won't feel like this forever. 
for me, freshman year was particularly strange for a lot of the reasons you describe - but by mid sophomore year, i had a different friendship group and different extracurriculars and a whole different take on it all. it's not going to happen overnight, but one of the great things about harvard is that every new term can be a completely fresh start in terms of classes and extracurriculars and social life.
while you still in the midst of creating conditions for change, one thing that really helped for me was simply making time to get off campus as often as possible. go for long walks or take the t and explore some of the nearby neighbourhoods. make time for those things you know you enjoy, whether that's movies or sports or whatever. i promise you, you don't always need to be putting every moment in the day to 'good use' (part of the learning curve of harvard is learning what is really necessary). i'd also really recommend choosing a low-time-commitment extra-curricular unrelated to your academic interests. i got a lot out of once a week after school tutoring with pbha - the chance to get out of the harvard bubble and interact with ordinary people living ordinary lives. i also went on one-off trips with the outing club or trips targeted at freshmen or particular house residents (e.g. trips to salem, hiking, apple picking, etc) - it can be a good, low-pressure opportunity to meet some new people who are also willing to dedicate some time to self-care and fun (and may also be going through some of the same struggles)"
647,"when i underwent a personal crisis at harvard i also wanted some validation and empathy from the administrators that i had to deal with. i've received more validation and empathy when calling customer service at my bank.

"
648,"she wrote this: 
>shortly after i reported my sexual assault to my house staff, i was told by a senior member of the college administration that the administrative board was very unlikely to “issue a charge” against my assailant and to launch a thorough investigative process because my assailant may not have technically violated the school’s policy in the student handbook.

then this, which i feel like is what you're talking about when you say they offered to investigate:
>the school was extremely reluctant to take any action against my assailant without a fair investigative process. in theory, this approach makes perfect sense. everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and you cannot take severe action against a student—such as forcing him to move to a different house—without a formal investigation process. but in practice, this works against sexual assault survivors at harvard.

taking these two together, as i read her she's saying the figures responsible for addressing allegations of sexual assault on campus preferred to hew to the school's narrow definition of sexual assault rather than actually try to help her in any significant way. yes, she does say this makes sense, since it's not like random administrators can change school policy by themselves. but she *also* seems to be arguing that that definition reflects a broader unwillingness by the university not only to address allegations of sexual assault, but also to offer basic support to a victim of sexual assault.

so that's the context of her saying (to everyone's horror!) that in practice ""innocent until proven guilty"" works against survivors of sexual assault at harvard. basically, ""innocent until proven guilty"" for the school doesn't mean ""avoid light accusations and rely on thorough investigations so everyone's treated as fairly as possible."" instead, for people in her situation it means ""the school refuses at every turn not only to make rudimentary efforts at investigation, but also to offer basic support. we prefer to force this person to resign herself to unsympathetic mental health counselors and sexual assault response staff, and stonewall her requests until eventually her only recourse is to transfer to another house to avoid seeing daily the person who assaulted her.""

there's a lot the school could've done without even coming close to violating the presumed innocence of the person who assaulted her, but as she tells it they did none of those things."
649,"i wouldn’t call someone else’s experience dramatic

sounds like they had a rough time making friends with people not of their socioeconomic and/or cultural background which definitely happens and is not so much a product of harvard as of those disparities in america."
650,"i think it probably also depends on when you attended harvard... minorities in 20 years ago had different experiences than those today. having graduated recently from harvard as a brown person, i think it's a very accepting campus."
651,"like most elite colleges in america, people will have varied experiences. 

at the end of the day, if you can graduate from harvard, you will have many more opportunities than if you didn’t. 

as much as life can suck at any university because you don’t fit in, it’s a tiny moment in the overall scope of your life."
652,"i know many people i’d consider “privileged” at harvard (on a socioeconomic level, yes, but also because they had stable home lives, parents very involved in their education, etc.) and many of them are white, but many of them are not. privilege comes in many forms at this school, especially considering harvard’s racial and socioeconomic demographics are quite different from the us as a whole (actually less white than the us is, but far far wealthier). race is just one of many complicating factors in the way privilege manifests itself here."
653,"from a grad student perspective i wouldn’t say the place reeks of privilege but it reeks of massive amounts of hard work and success. i think there’s a difference. yes the people at harvard are successful and more successful than my peers from ugrad but from what i’ve seen they also work harder and prepare more than my peers from ugrad. part of this is yes some of them do have connections or make connections with classmates but also everyone here is driven for success. my .02, do with my observations what you may."

655,i'd say thats more boston in general than harvard specifically tbh
656,"i've encountered willfully ignorant people at harvard more than once, but this is an exaggeration, to say the least. not to invalidate his, or anyone's experience, but basically dividing us into privileged racists vs. the racially oppressed is more representative of his mindset rather than his experience. as someone already mentioned, it also matters if they attended harvard 4 or 40 years ago. harvard has so many inviting and safe spaces for poc, people of different religions, ethnic groups etc. that can help people find their place if they find it hard to adjust in a new environment. 

you will most definitely feel out of place if you're surrounded by people whose lifestyles you can't keep up with. it's easy to feel alone and like the odds are against you, and while i'm not disagreeing that harvard houses those with socioeconomic privilege and that elitism can still be found in some places, it's unfair of him to say that his experience is representative of how things are."
657,"id beg to respectfully disagree. i think that this is an experience that is not representative of all students. i understand that that you may think that it was a sheltered environment. however, isn’t university supposed to be a sheltered environment in the first place? it is supposed to be a heart warming and welcoming community to nurture and develop personality, talent, and passion. i strongly believe that harvard does so. if it comes to ignoring the world about racial tensions, that is fine as long as it is publicly available at the institution for those who choose to utilize it. due to the highly diverse community at harvard there is the potential that some may get offended when certain issues are brought up. this, i conclude that a neutral stance is the best stance for an institution such as harvard where various people of various backgrounds can nurture and develop their talents."
658,if you think racism exists at harvard you are delusional.
659,"i think it really depends on you finding your niche. if you manage to find a group of people with similar backgrounds then it will be an amazing time but from the start if you hang out with privileged friends then your lack of privilege will become apparent and frustrating. i don’t believe this experience is indicative of harvard as a whole, as it indeed is an extremely diverse place (coming from a fgli student)."
660,"however, as an international hub, harvard does have a lot of socioeconomic diversity in a very condensed area. furthermore, after the election, racism did flare on campus..."
661,"hot take — if you’re at harvard, you’re now privileged. 

we all know the doors it opens and you might choose to not pursue a career in finance or consulting, but you could and having the option to make 100k+ a year after college is absurdly privileged."
662,that doesnt justify racism at harvard.
663,"many lifestyle differences stem from systemic racial plight though... also, just because i’m going to school doesn’t mean that i should have to shed my dignity and not want respect. that’s so dumb of you. everyone everywhere should be respected no matter what, and at some institutions, people don’t give you a basic sliver of it. finally, if you care so much about the african american community, why does your post and comment history have “chance a real n**** for harvard,” and “the guy shooting is a fucking badass. fuck around and find out antifa blm punks!”? 😐"
664,"look the whole situation sucks, but if the entire class of 24 is escalating this to a huge extent (not to say he hasnt done any wrong) you’re really just fighting fire with fire. if all he has is some acceptance letters from people i really dont see him as a creep in terms of the instagram ownership, just a shitty guy. like he’s gonna have a shitty time at harvard so just let him have that instead of pouring oil on the flame. he wants attention. he’s getting attention."
665,i honestly really hope someone ends up sending all this to harvard.  it's really unacceptable for him to get away doing stuff like this and making everyone feel uncomfortable all around
666,is someone sending this and the main thread against albert to harvard?
667,"i've been admitted to both harvard and cambridge. i'm a british student so would be an international at harvard. i plan to study bioengineering in hopes of going into biotech.

668,"i was lucky enough to be accepted at harvard and yale. i am an icelandic climate activist hoping to do environmental science and public policy. 

i see that it’s a very small department and i was hoping to ask someone if they feel that it gets lost in the other ones (cs, econ, math).  and just in general, what is the program like?

also i had a question about the special concentration (aka picking your own major). how difficult is it to get something like that approved? if i can make up my own major in sustainability, that would be a deciding factor for me

669,"harvard v. brown

not 100% sure what i want to do, but i’m going into chem and will probably end up doing pre med (or something related to medicine/drugs... probably not engineering tho)

so i’ve narrowed down options to the two schools i mentioned.

i was set set on brown (accepted after being deferred), but i was shocked when i got into harvard. the thing is, i love browns laid back culture, but harvard is harvard and i can’t get past the prestige. if i decide to change my major, i don’t want to look back and regret passing up on h.

besides location and prestige, i think brown’s laid back culture would be somewhat of a better fit for me— and the open curriculum allow me some wiggle room if i decide to do something other than chem. i also come from a lower income background, and heard wealth plays a large role in the social culture at harvard which wouldn’t be good for me lol. also, apparently h professors are more focused on research than teaching? getting sidetracked but i can’t stop imaging myself passing up harvard and beating myself up for it later wondering what could’ve been."

674,"harvard vs stanford

hey everyone! i am currently in the process of deciding between harvard and stanford for my undergrad years. 
i am a low-income lgbtq+ student from fl planning on majoring in bioengineering.

i would love to talk with current bio students or students who share other similarities with me to learn more about harvard and gauge the nuances of bio at harvard vs at stanford. feel free to pm me!"
675,"harvard vs. umich

likely bioengineering or biochem. costs are not an issue. on mobile so sorry for formatting.

hello everyone, hope you’re all safe and well. i was accepted to umich early after most of my high school life being so umich oriented and i was so damn grateful. i aimed at getting accepted at an ivy but never really considered the possibility. thankfully i got accepted into harvard too, and i never thought i’d actually be in a position where i need to make a decision. it seems like harvard is the way to go and everyone expects me to commit, and i’d love to of course, but as the deadline approaches i’m dreading detaching from umich.

that said:

umich (lsa) ——— pros: -quite close to home

-in state tuition and i’m covered very well with financial aid, plus amazing scholarships

-i’m quite familiar with the city and campus of ann arbor, and i love it so much.

-amazing programs and research facilities for stem. the undergrad research opportunity program i know a lot about

-party and social life seems very compelling (i’m an extremely social person)

-i have many good friends attending there to help introduce me to and guide me through programs/courses

-i can choose to live in an apartment w friends, cook my own meals, cheaper than dorms and i get financial aid as a check

-i’m already used to michigan weather lmao.

cons: -missing out on a completely different lifestyle at harvard

-still just as difficult a courseload and expectations as harvard

•	⁠would have to try to transfer to engineering department to major in biomedical engineering. this would be an issue cause the engineering department is much more difficult to get accepted to. so taking a big risk if i go down that route

-everyone freaking out i didn’t accept harvard

-don’t know about meal plan and food quality if i dorm there

harvard —————

pros: -literally harvard

-grade inflation

-many internship opportunities in the cities.

-bioengineering degree ( b.s. ) courseload is basically set, easy to select as major

-i have multiple good friends accepted from class of 2018/19 and know a couple alumni who can help me out along the way.

-very new lifestyle completely independent of family and i’m excited to adapt

•	⁠very very good financial aid, plus return on some scholarships. i’d start freshman year off well

-cambridge/boston have lots to explore, entire northeast section of america is more accessible to me

-long time friends are at mit so we could meet up!

-forgot the rest but feel free to add more pros and encourage me

cons:

•	⁠taking a bioengineering (b.s.) major means little flexibility in schedule to take interesting/ fun courses. a b.a. means i need to take more steps post undergrad to get my degree accredited for a career.

-i know i’m going to college to study not party but i sacrificed so much social life these last years and with corona stripping my only semester with freedom away, i so desperately want a better party atmosphere. this may be biased off their experiences but according to my friends there and others online, those rare moments when you’re not blasted w harvard courseload the parties aren’t nearly all that.

-the fooood. i’ve heard it’s not the best and cooking for myself isn’t the best option either. i have some religious dietary restrictions so i kinda need to consider that. in terms of city restaurants, i don’t know how many good options there are that suit the restrictions, i’d bet there aren’t many.

•	⁠i’ve visited campus last summer and it didn’t strike me as much as ann arbor’s does. i’ve only ever self toured the harvard campus though.

-i cannot process urban city life. it just seemed like the weather and air itself was less enjoyable. things were more rushed and cramped. usually cloudier. i’m very comfortable w the more suburban close knit feel at umich. although i’ll be spending most time on campus so i think i won’t feel this as much.

that’s all i can think of for now i hope i don’t come off as ungrateful or pretentious or anything. i just so desperately want to make the most out of every college experience (barring the shutdown doesn’t extend till fall semester). i’d appreciate as much input as i can on both and a decision.

thank you!"
676,"hi, also a british student, who chose to attend harvard. my background is computer science, but i did some research in bioinformatics. i have friends at cambridge, and i did spend some time there as part of their residential program. so, pretty relevant experience in answering your questions!

it comes down to how you work, and what you want from a university experience. cambridge is academic to the nth degree. this is for a number of factors, but lack of holistic evaluation, and the short terms mean that when you are at university you are working your ass off. there is a social scene if you really look for it, but students at cambridge are either happy doing lectures 6 days a week and homework on sundays, or can pressure themselves into doing it.

now, i'm probably biased. i love harvard. but with a 4 year course, you have a certain amount of flexibility that is just plain cool. like i said, i am a computer scientist, and in the uk i would have been locked into it. this year, i have done chinese, ancient greek warfare, genetics and bio ethic etc. etc. along side my usual computer science studies. you spend a significant amount more time actually at university as well, so there is less of this cram culture, and you get to make more meaningful connections and enjoy your time there a little bit. boston in beautiful, and a real city very much unlike cambridge. you get to really live independently, as there is no way to hop home all the time (or have parents visit every other weekend). the academic flexibility is unparalleled, you get to really explore your subject and any other academic interests you have.

there are a few cons, but you can spin all of them:

roomates- honestly not that bad, and it means that you have instant friends.

work / interning - really easy to do, with your student visa you get 12 months work time over here, so you can intern in la if you want over the summer. you also finish a little earlier in the summer, so if you want to come back to the uk you have a slight edge.

drinking age- i wouldn't worry about the 21 thing ;)

football - yes, they call it soccer. but also yes american football is surprisingly entertaining. harvard yale is really something else.

happy to answer any other questions about uk specific things, but if i were you i'd go harvard. people on the cambridge subreddit will probably have their own views, but i think in terms of maximizing this once in a life time university experience, harvard is the way to do it."
677,"i am a mechanical engineering student at harvard and can weigh in a bit about harvard only. the engineering department right now is relatively small. there are about 100 engineers total that graduate each year. this includes bioe, meche, ee, and enviroe. with this small size, you end up having a pretty close knit academic environment, which was a plus for me. i feel that undergraduates in general are well treated in harvard school of engineering and applied sciences (seas). we have excellent access to professors and opportunities to do research relatively easily. advising is readily available if you put in the effort to seek it out. 

there is also the opening of our new engineering campus you have to consider. i just went on a tour of it while it is still is under construction. it is beautiful and might be a really nice part of your college experience. lots of spaces for undergraduate engineering students. i could definitely put you in touch with harvard bioengineers if you want their perspective on classes and curriculum."
678,"i found that the professors at harvard are very invested in their teaching (those that i had anyway). often, their passion for their research only improves their passion for teaching students and sharing their breakthroughs with pupils. i had several classes with world experts in their field and the fact that their research was so renowned made my classroom experience much more enjoyable. it meant i could learn things that weren't written in any book, website, or any other class syllabus in the world."
679,"dartmouth is a horrible culture, unless you like frat houses or the great outdoors it’s not a good environment. cambridge and boston are wonderful cities full of wonderful people, with diverse communities that i truly feel like anyone can find a home in. no one i’ve met at harvard takes dartmouth seriously as a school.

source: i almost went to dartmouth, my brother transferred out of dartmouth, and my dad graduated from there in the very animal house-esque 1960’s. i love harvard very deeply."
680,"i just submitted my thesis as a mechanical engineer at harvard, which means i have satisfied all of my abet requirements. you can certainly do it in four years. some people even work in a minor as well, usually in computer science or applied math or the like. however, it is not easy. everyone else in the college has about half of the amount of required courses that you have. this means that you have much less flexibility and have to be   a bit careful with course selection in sophomore year and beyond. you always have the option of switching to the non-accredited degree, which has fewer requirements. i personally tried to front load my courses and ended up having a relatively light course load in my senior year, which gave me time to work on my thesis.

my view on classes. in general, engineering is hard and i think that’s just as true at dartmouth and harvard and anywhere else. because of our small class size we have excellent access to professors and administration. also, you will have a brand new campus at harvard which will offer many great resources (undergraduate labs, students spaces, slick lecture halls...). i toured the facility recently."
681,"this is incredibly helpful! thank you so much for your detailed account. i have a few follow up questions.

on the cambridge sub reddit they were emphasising the depth of learning around a subject. if i were to complete my concentration in bioengineering at harvard do you think my depth of knowledge would be less than if i had done so at cambridge? i know this will in part be affected by classes that i choose to take but intend to take classes that are academically rigorous. 

and if i were to come out of harvard with 'less knowledge' than at cambridge do you think this would make me less employable? the last thing i would want is for biotech firms to favour british educated students due to a more thorough scientific background.

but i do really like the flexibility in classes and am very excited to take up a new language, continue with writing and enrichment classes.

also in terms of work/interning would employers need to fill out additional paperwork to give me an internship place as an international ? would this make it less likely for me to get any places? have you observed an american citizen bias? though if this is not a problem boston being a biotech hub should be great!

i think i am leaning towards harvard at the moment. in terms of accomodation i've seen some youtube videos where the bathrooms look quite appalling. how common is this? i think my parents are quite concerned about roommates but i think it should be okay.

i don't drink so the alcohol thing isn't a big issue:)

also in terms of boston weather, are the winters much colder than the uk? do you think i'll need to buy winter boots? or should normal uk winter wear be okay?

also did you buy a laptop in the uk before coming to harvard or whilst in the us? this is probably a stupid question.

thank you so much for providing such a comprehensive pros and cons list. i may message you again a few weeks down the line if i have any more questions :)

tldr do you think cambridge graduates come out as better scientists than their harvard counterparts?

if cambridge grads to have more depth of knowledge are they more employable than harvard graduates?"
682,"no, i don't buy the less knowledgeable thing. cambridge students get their masters in bioengineering, and harvard students get their masters at cambridge. if there was a discrepancy here, it would not be possible. you do cover the same content, and if anything the incerased industry exposure you get through the us system makes you more employable. if pure academic bio tech was your thing, there might be a greater argument for cambridge, but i still don't think it cuts close enough to make a significant difference.

the university handles most of the paper work. you have to do an extra tax form or two, but there isn't any bias that i am aware of.

living conditions as a student are not as nice as what cambridge offers, this is true. the first year halls are particularly old, and so some of the bathroom arrangements are less than optimal. i guess it depends on your standards, but the bathrooms are cleaned by dorm crew, and the set ups in years 2 3 and 4 are significantly better.

i really liked my roommates, as do the majority of people. sometimes they are your ""friends for life"" and sometimes they are just people you see in the evenings, but you have your main friend group elsewhere. remember, you are sharing with other harvard students, so a pretty good demographic to get randomly placed with!

no worries on not drinking, there a plenty who don't. in fact, because of the law etc. there really isn't any pressure to do so.

boston gets colder. it is more similar to the very heaviest days of our winter for a month or two straight. winter boots would be a good idea, but the harvard snow team work through the night with a fleet of snow plows making sure all the paths are clear. unlike the uk, they are actually prepared for more than 2 inches.

i bought a laptop before. if you full financial aid, they will give you $2500 dollars or something toward a laptop once you arrive, so that's quite cool. i have a surface, which is great because i can write on it with the pen thing.

good luck in your decisions, remember i am biased, but harvard really was the best decision i've made."
683,"i wouldn't say they are bad, but the structure of how the degree works is fiddly. note: you can take any of mit's engineering classes as a harvard student. they even run a special shuttle, and it counts towards your harvard degree. people like to complain about the engineering department, but it's largely hot air."
684,"i can chime in on this. i'm a senior physics concentrator, but for a little while i was in ee and took a lot of classes in it. although this isn't bioengineering, i'm familiar with the bioengineering requirements and have some friends doing it (and bme as well). 

i would say that the engineering courses i've taken have on average been rated more poorly than courses from other departments, and to be frank, i didn't enjoy those courses very much either, although i like engineering and will be studying it in grad school. but i will say that the one area where i think harvard shines in engineering is absolutely bioengineering! harvard has fantastic bioengineering resources, and there are amazing research labs here. look up the wyss institute, especially! most of the bad comments about engineering you see here and will hear at harvard are mostly about the meche and ee programs, not so much bioengineering, but you will share courses so there are some shared concerns.

when people say the degree structure is weird, i think it's because of the whole ab vs sb thing. take a look at the following: [https://www.seas.harvard.edu/bioengineering/undergraduate-program/concentration-information](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/bioengineering/undergraduate-program/concentration-information). it explains the 3 different kinds of bioeng type degrees you can get, two of which are ab and one of which is sb. the sb degree is definitely what you want if you want to be an engineer and/or go to grad school to continue studying bioengineering. you will typically have a much more demanding schedule than others, at least in terms of sheer requirements. 

i don't think you should underestimate the immense value in the biotech community at harvard and in the greater boston area. if i were in your shoes, i'd choose harvard, though i admittedly do not know how strong cambridge is. feel free to ask me any more questions!"
685,"it’s unlikely that your first year advisor will sign you off on taking a class at mit for the first semester because they’ll want you to get used to the rigor of courses at harvard. you also meet a lot of peers through introductory courses in the first year. the shuttle is nice, but it is a huge time sink and, for a general science class, wouldn’t be worth it unless you’d be willing to lose a whole day for a class. 

i have had friends who did bioengineering and they all agreed, it’s hell because of how demanding the course requirements are (i believe the advisor was new as well, and that didn’t help). they all went for the ab degree and not the sb degree, but i don’t think it made much of a difference in the end for the career paths they chose. 

a very very important note that someone has already commented is that boston is a biotech hub, so you’ll find an amazing amount of opportunities there. also, labs in the area are very receptive to taking undergrads (even from freshman year), even famous/high profile labs if you don’t specialize in what they do. i had a friend studying physics who was able to work in a great stem cell lab. the research experience and connections you make through that are what make a lot of harvard students successful for grad school and beyond, not just the courses they take."
686,i wish i read this when i was a senior in high school and again at graduation from harvard.

688,"it’s funny that quite a few of my posts are offered as exhibits to hes related posts, lol. just doing me part. a hes automod is ok although i think we can fend for ourselves. the op are usually fine, it’s the comments that derail the thread. perhaps a hes affiliated mod(or really any mod) can work the comment section for these posts. 

truth be told, i am not interested in hearing what non harvard affiliates have to say with respect to the extension school as it relates to other schools within the university. imo that’s the biggest issue."
689,"i answered this in a thread from a while back - https://reddit.com/r/harvard/comments/fqnloz/what_do_you_wish_you_had_known_as_a_freshmen/flv2beu/

i focused mostly on academic stuff though"
690,it’s harvard. what did you expect? yale?
691,"i agree with you. i'm an older alumna, but even when i was there so many students put their extracurricular activities first that it's easy to understand why you would do that. it's not that there aren't many serious students, but many of the flashier, more extraverted types are heavily involved in activities. and if you were someone who did well at one of the major organizations like the crimson or the lampoon, it probably helped your career.

a friend of mine said his father took one look at the craziness of harvard yard during the moving in period and told him to find one activity by the end of the week and commit to it. although his father was college-educated, he hadn't gone to a place like harvard. he could tell it could be overwhelming, which i thought was very astute. my friend's choice worked out for him."
692,hard to believe you go to harvard. you misspelled the names of two important authors. it was remarkable how many people there spoke different languages.
693,hahah ;) so far harvard students are already exceeding my expectations!
694,oh i’m sorry you think ya some kind of law funny guy huh? well you know what we do to law funny guys at the harvard subreddit? we ban them
695,">instead of opening outposts in china, harvard could be opening campuses in the midwest and using the new locations to expand and experiment with new models of education.

do we have an outpost like that? i know there's a duke and nyu in china. there's also a cornell med in qatar that looks pretty cool."
696,"uh... sure, i guess? i'm not convinced that starting a new university would do much to improve the higher education system, but it's not like the harvard corporation needs all this money it's sitting on."
697,"i don’t think we do. the only thing that comes to mind in china is that harvard shanghai center, which isn’t the same as an “outpost” — more of an alum clubhouse."
698,"and in 2013, there was this ...  jeffrey epstein, science financier, changes the course of evolution at harvard

708,"weinstein brought more scrutiny to a house that has been plagued by documented problems for years. students of course have a right to be uncomfortable with sullivan representing weinstein, but the other issues (concerns of budget abuse, parade of house admin replacements, lack of care for house events, lack of care for students and house staff, active hostility, etc.) should have been enough to warrant a deep review. sullivan and robinson’s responses to any sort of criticism over the last few months have been out of touch and ridiculous. at the end of the day, the faculty deans are for the benefit of students, and with the climate in winthrop deteriorating, i’m glad harvard finally decided to cut them off."
709,harvard wasn’t on the list! only yale and stanford
710,"i do worry that as more stories come out criticizing the admission process people will begin to question the merit of a harvard degree or degree of an other elite institution . that is not to say that the college admission process, especially at harvard, shouldn’t be strictly evaluated and be made more equitable. "
711,there’s complete morons who go to harvard. 
712,the fbi arent done investigating. i have a feeling as the fbi progressively catch more people committing admission fraud someone from harvard will get named.
713,"i actually think the opposite may be true. the reason there's admissions drama in the first place is because it's obviously very desirable to come here. any time someone criticizes the admissions process, it's an implicit endorsement of the immense value of a harvard degree, which is why people are so concerned about making sure the process for gaining access to it is fair. "
714,"i mean, i think people already do to some degree; if you’re an idiot who went to harvard, they’re going to question how you got in. but that’s really the case with every school."
715,well see. i feel like people who buy their way into harvard do it the old fashioned way; donate a building or endow a scholarship. 
716,"harvard has been fighting the fight for opaque admissions for decades. in the wake of this and the sffa, i think harvard needs to have a long hard think about whether it wants to keep up that paradigm. i know there is definitely the unfair assumption floating around boston that there are two kinds of harvard students: the truly brilliant, and those that got in because of their parents' money or influence. it's unfair to the vast majority of harvard students who truly earned their spot. getting rid of the separate admissions track for children of celebrities and politicians and donors would be a great place to start...

edit: this isn't unique to harvard, but its commitment to admissions opacity is certainly not doing it any favors."
717,i think it's like harvard's community college.
718,i wouldn't be surprised if harvard gets named soon. i've met some pretty questionable students in my classes lol
719,"factoring in how many of those accepted students were legacy: jesus, that's fucking low.

i remember how getting accepted to college was my entire world in high school. after checking out r/applyingtocollege (out of morbid curiosity, i suppose) i see a lot of cynicism, despair, and depression, and my heart goes out to these kids.

rejection letters are dreadfully well-crafted prices of trite clichés, but when they say stuff akin to ""you'd be a great student here and you'll be successful elsewhere,"" when a cutoff is that arbitrarily low, it's true. there is absolutely no intellectual difference between some accepted and a lot of rejected applicants, and this truth gets diminished by the thoroughly toxic culture of elitist rhetoric surrounding admissions, the vast majority of which comes from outside. and this toxic culture carries over into the accepted class with almost this strange variation of survivor's guilt i've noticed. 

i think if one would be successful at harvard, one doesn't need harvard to achieve whatever one would wish to achieve. those kids just gotta not let the heartbreak get to their psyche, or channel it to propel themselves forward.

i just feel for those kids who feel so down now. just wish they could know that harvard college has a lot, but doesn't have it all; though this place is wonderful, other colleges offer wonderful things which this university does not. such as warm weather. 

to those accepted: congratulations & welcome to the best university on earth! to those not: i feel like it's impossible to say something about how great other other undergraduate experiences are too without sounding patronizing. take cs50 through edx this summer for a bit of the experience.

but i didn't go to harvard college, that's my disclaimer, i'm merely immersed just enough to have a better sense of what the college is like than most. if any college students here have differing thoughts on the subject, i'd love to hear."
720,"there is no need for you to send the evaluation form.  as a tf you will be evaluated in harvards q-score system by the students and that info will be available for you and other students to see once its compiled.

what courses are you tf'ing for?  because that matters.

in cs classes what is important is that students get the intuition behind what is going on, some are just lost.  you have to identify their weakness or what they are lacking and guide them to resources so they can improve.  you want to give nudges in the right direction.  

i would be very active on the forums, and compile your office hours/section around what common things people are having trouble with.  if there is a problem specific to a student, i would save that for one on one and not section.   

success as a tf is being available and helpful. it is not for everyone and can be challenging if you have a course load yourself.  people depend on you and so you must stretch yourself to deliver on expectations.  it can be very rewarding."
721,"i did alumni interviewing and go to some harvard club events in my city every so often. i also give every year towards financial aid, because i benefitted so much from it when i was there."
722,"if you are local to harvard, you could consider asking one of the undergraduate houses about being a nonresident tutor. you can occasionally (maybe once a month) go to the house and interact with students."
723,"football games (not just the game, but as many home games as i can manage), the harvard club, and an annual gift."
724,"i’m still paying the loans down, so my relationship has pretty much been one of “debtor”

i went to my 5 year

i answer donation calls politely, but decline to donate

i vote online for overseers/alumni board, mostly for anybody who brings variety of expertise and experience to the table

i wrote a strong letter of recommendation for exactly one high school student who stood apart in 5 years of teaching

i maintain paid membership in harvardwood. it confers approximately zero benefits to me, but i’m in the entertainment industry and it’s $3.75/mo. i’ve thought about trying to build a chicago chapter to help connect alums not working in nyc/la.

i go to the harvard in your city events every now and then and occasionally bump into a classmate

i follow the crimson, the harvard gazette, and publicly push for improvements to institutional behavior, ex. divesting from fossil fuels, supporting grad student and employee unions"
725,the harvard club of new york hosts a monthly cocktail night which i try to go to. it’s nice to see friends and there’s a ton of networking opportunities. i’m trying to be an alumni interviewer but i heard it’s hard to get since there’s a surplus of harvard grads in new york.
726,"you may get ideas if you are on the mailing lists for the harvard club, harvard alumni association, and follow harvard and harvardalumni on instagram and other social media."
727,"i travel back to attend the harvard law school parody every year, and am on the board of its alumni association, plus i donate to it annually."
728,"it just wasn't my vibe. i like that it felt harvard, so to speak, but i wish it felt newer and more representative of the student body at present. i know that wouldn't make any business sense, just what i would personally prefer. something younger feeling?"
729,"it felt very friendly but very stuffy. 

harvard is very, very dear to me. but i moved to ny because it is vibrant, creative, energetic. i work in media now. the clothes i wear to work, where i meet with high level executives and sometimes celebrities, are not within the expected dress code. i just am never in situations where it is convenient to drop in and feel natural or comfortable, it's always something i would have to go home and prepare separately for."
730,gotcha. what would you suggest then as far as what spots are great for being social or networking hubs for recent grads? (harvard related or not)
731,i’d do anything to live in cabot right now if i could still be at harvard!
732,"that’s why i transferred from currier to lowell.  great decision and i didn’t look back.  : )  currier didn’t even feel like harvard—it felt like an old marriott hotel from the 1970s.  plus, the shuttles."
733,"harvard business school does, but they aren't free for mbas. i think they give them to phd students for free though."
734,"the vast majority of what you see online will be people with negative experiences looking to vent. tons of people like/love the school, but being a young adult is difficult, and harvard does have some qualities that probably amplify the struggle. are those qualities unique to harvard? i’d say no for the most part. 

take a couple thousand of the world’s most high achieving students and dump them together — there will be some who find the environment rough for the first time.

edit: also, harvard students on reddit do not represent harvard demographics as a whole. plenty of students don’t use reddit, and there may be reason to believe that the group of non-redditors is less cynical. this subreddit is mostly frequented by prefrosh tbh, and the stories you hear are repeated a lot by the same people."
735,"loved it. harvard is a special , awesome place. there is something for everyone.

&#x200b;

the only thing i hated was boston weather."
736,"people are more likely to post and comment about negative aspects than positive ones. in occasions because they want to know if they are the only ones perceiving it as such, as it most likely is an unpopular opinion.

i can't find the study about this right now, i will try to post a link to it once i find it. it has to do with [negative bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negativity_bias).

overall, some if not most of the complaints i see here are really more *about the college experience*, rather than harvard. i do believe that most people can't simply compare harvard to another institution because there are only a few transfer students who have actually experienced harvard and another school.

for these reasons, i wouldn't take in consideration the comments posted here as a representation of the student body's attitudes toward the school. at the very least, i wouldn't treat it as gospel."
737,"the time of year also affects this. late winter to early spring is the most difficult time. 

i loved my time at harvard, but there were dark days, too."
738,"i think most people feel a little anxious here, if only because harvard's status has a tendency to amplify all the usual anxieties one gets when going to college/grad school. it doesn't help when everyone around you perfects an air of serene well-adjustment.

&#x200b;

beneath that, i think most students like it here. it's a special place, no doubt, in spite of it all."
739,"as someone that graduated from there few years back, i miss it quite a bit. kind of like restaurant reviews, people usually post more when they have something negative to share. harvard itself is great so its more edgy to talk to shit about going here. trust me, way more people love it here than hate it."
740,"if this post is in response to mine, all i will say is it is very difficult if not impossible to understand the college's situation if you haven't gone there. i don't really talk to harvard to people who don't go there, because they really can't wrap their mind around it."
741,"i for one not only like, but *love* harvard."
742,"i'm a graduate student at harvard, but i love it! there's so many resources that i can take advantage of, both for research prospects, and various general skills. they also have pretty good resources for mental health, because they know students tend to put too much pressure on themselves.

i love the cities around harvard."
743,"eli5: what does prefrosh mean? apologies as i am not a harvard student, but i'll be working for harvard soon."
744,"the adcom rejects ~95% of applicants. they definitely know how to weed people out, and they clearly chose you because they felt you were good enough for harvard."
745,"first, thank you for bringing this up. 

i spoke with another classmate less than a week ago about changes in family behavior towards us that sound similar to the strangeness you report. family and friends back home may feel alienated, left behind, like their world isn't good enough for you. we both made clear to our parents and friends back home that the life back there with them is just as much, or even more a part of who we are at harvard. i feel like explicitly making clear that they are not being forgotten and are loved definitely helped. 

what you report is not out of the ordinary. consider bringing it up to someone you feel closest to at home and see if they can help you diagnose the issue from a back-home perspective. "
746,"what your grandma is saying is demeaning to your great accomplishments. when people say these things, and perhaps your grandma isn't intentionally trying to communicate this, it is often to make themselves or others feel better. 

furthermore, if this encounter still puts you off, i would think about how incredibly stupid the statement is all together. how are 'book smarts' and intelligence any different from reasonable common sense and judgement. intelligence as a whole is so much more complicated than 'book smarts' and judgement. additionally, none of those things are mutually exclusive. you're a smart person, that's why you go to harvard. fuck what grandma said."
747,"i noticed you had flair for harvard extension. i too am studying through the extension school (online), and i feel like i'm cheating the system, in a way. like my enrollment through harvard extension isn't truly part of harvard, and like i don't deserve to enjoy the same rights, privileges, and prestige of studying under the harvard university umbrella. 

assuming you're a student in the extension school, how have you dealt with any feelings of inadequacy, if any?"
748,"if you are an admitted degree candidate, then you deserve to be in the school.  the admission rate with extension's admission process is about 31 %, higher than the college of course, but lower than schools like divinity. so give yourself a pat on the back.

you should be in school because it is a fit for you, not because you feel the need to drop the h-bomb or want prestige. irl, i never mention harvard extension, as i am doing the degree for me and i am enjoying myself. i think dropping the h-bomb is even worse for me because i feel the need to explain that is is a continuing education masters degree and then it comes off as ""humble bragging"".

in my experience, the people who talk about a ""back door"" into harvard are those who care more about the name of the school than getting a great education for non-traditional students.

enjoy yourself , learn as much as you can and get the enjoy the experience.

edit: the 31% admission rate was from 2016 i believe."
749,"pros:
went to hes for free
great local alumni scene. 
made great connections. 

have good friends from the college and hbs ,despite what reddit thinks about it. 

worked with amazing students.  

have no problems getting interviews

proud parents/hometown lmao. 

cons: 
constantly being quizzed by tryhards 

major league insecurity by those with no/inferior degrees (their words, not mine), when i couldn’t care any less. 

not being able to talk about harvard all that much as to not be ‘that’ guy. 

having to explain what hes is. 

no sleep.

750,"throw away account.  i went to mckinsey, then bcg, then svp at fortune 500 then c-level at fortune 500, all in first 10 years and before turning 35.  combination of skill and luck, but the name helps open doors that otherwise wouldn’t open. 

don’t listen to people who tell you hiring managers throw hes resumes in the trash.  i’ve worked campus recruiting for several of the above and it’s not true.

always emphasize the challenge of working full time and going to school, let alone harvard, full time.  and have something else showing distinctive leadership on your resume.  it’s impressive to people."
751,"i might be posting a bit too late for visibility, but i'll chip in that hues has been life-changing for me.

i got a great music education through high school (studied privately with two of the most well-known names in jazz education, kind of by accident) and walked into a professional performing career at 18. i spent almost three decades playing music— touring the world, living overseas for long stretches at a time, doing a fair amount of teaching. for the last decade i've been working mostly in theater, to the point where i'm currently the artistic director of an emerging developmental theater company. but i've always felt that the lack of a formal degree was limiting.

a bit over two years ago i decided to start at hues. i thought the expo-25 course was the biggest mistake i'd ever made—my professor was great, but i wasn't prepared for how intense the requirements were. the feedback was sharp and spot-on, definitely not for the thin-skinned. and the attrition was completely unexpected—we lost six people after the first class meeting as their writing was deemed lacking, and one more of my classmates withdrew in the third week. but i did well, finished all of the entry requirements, and gained admission.

since then, as i said above, it's been life-changing. the advising staff is fantastic; responsive to questions, proactive with suggestions, and generally very supportive. the academic quality is first-rate all the way. i've taken a number of harvard college classes in the unique way that hues offers them, as live/recorded lectures with an hues tf assigned; one of those classes set up discussion sections that included both college and hues students. one course i took last semester was cross-registered at the t.h. chan school of public health, hks, and hues.

but, to the question: the academic opportunity is what pursuing the alb degree has changed for me. i'm transitioning out of the performing arts world into a parallel career with public policy, social science, and arts elements. i'm looking at graduate research in those areas at a few places; the admissions departments i've corresponded with are impressed that the hues degree is both a harvard degree and that it's earned while working full-time—one professor told me that the fact of juggling both was more impressive in itself than any single thing she's seen on a grad school application. so, that's my experience.

to echo what a few other posts have pointed out, it's rare-to-nonexistent in my own experience to encounter someone treating the degree as some kind of second-rate education. it's been the opposite—folks tend to accept that harvard isn't going to put its name on something lightly. one of my biggest supporters as i've been juggling my schedule over the last few years is a harvard college grad who works in my company, actually. she's always asking about classes i'm taking and has been vicariously excited for me on every campus trip i've had. anyway—hope this helps!"
752,"i loved it. kept my current gig, started a side company. more money, more opportunities. 

it really is just a great program for people who are already working full time. 

being associated with harvard just elevates your resume to a whole new level."
753,i’m there now got me a position at jnj currently and an interview with mckinsey and bcg. i worked for it like everyone else and joined the consulting club and the like but it’s good shit. it’s a harvard education.
754,"i did the post-bac program and am starting med school next month. a friend starting in the program and ended up transferring to masters program in harvard gsas. hes sets you up with great contacts and internship opportunities and, as someone previously stated, you have access to all harvard resources"
755,"i'm currently in the degree program, so i can't offer any personal post-grad insight, but what i can tell you is that when you graduate, you'll have access to the benefits of the harvard alumni association.  essentially, you're walking out with a ton of contacts and will have access to a huge professional network of university alumni.  this can absolutely help career trajectory.

the extension school also has an annual career fair, so students are fairly well positioned to find new opportunities before graduation."
756,"it's harvard courses offered for non-traditional students who have had a break after an associates, incompelte undergrad, or no college to pursue a career. most employers will look at it better than a normal harvard college degree. it proves an employers ability to follow through on 60+ college credits in a traditional timeline while working full time and advancing their career. 

i've had friends who went through it and transitioned into a masters or phd at harvard college and other ivy's. a friend of mine worked as an executive assistant at a boutique pe firm. after graduating he made vp at alliance bernstein 2x faster than a traditional ib graduate. obviously every story is different, but it carries the harvard name and proof of a good work ethic."
757,"i am nearing the end of my master's degree in software engineering (really, data science) at harvard. it's been a terrific experience and i highly recommend it - i particularly recommend it if you can actually move to cambridge and take part in university life (even if that means just attending lecture).  


unlike my mba at uchicago, i was able to pay for this completely out of pocket. i had some company sponsorship at points, but mostly have just paid as i've gone so - no student debt from that.

i never really expected anyone to oooo and ahhh about the fact that i'm going to harvard, but recently i got a pretty darn lucrative consulting engagement that was based in part (the hiring manager tells me) on the fact that i am at harvard. so there's some definite reputation value there, at least in that case. (and he knows that i'm a part time student pursuing one course at a time... i work >50 hours a week so there's literally no other way on the planet i could to it.)"
758,">don’t listen to people who tell you hiring managers throw hes resumes in the trash.  i’ve worked campus recruiting for several of the above and it’s not true.

i don't get the stigma associated hes. a significant portion (maybe even slight majority?) of the courses are cross-registered with ""actual"" harvard courses and also a lot of the professors are harvard faculty. plus, you get all the resources of harvard university. definitely one of the best-value continuing education programs in the country imo."
759,"“most employers will look at it better than a normal harvard college degree.”
wtf did i just read."
760,"i simply explain it's a school of the harvard university umbrella (others being harvard med, college, law etc.) and that extension houses a wide array of degree programs otherwise not offered in harvard's other schools.

don't forget the part about it being friendly to part-time students if working full-time during is a particular flex for your interview haha."

762,"it's one of the best educational deals in academia. and the only time i see 'stigma' is commenters on the harvard crimson who are terribly insecure that hues may 'dilute' their status. never heard or seen 'stigma' in my real life in my time on campus the past 3 years. funny enough - hues likely left hu as a whole much more prepared for remote learning due to covid.

i've friends in hc, gsas, hbs, etc. most of my classes the past 3 years were the same syllabus-wise as my buddies' and we had the same professors. harvard professors are busy as can be - one of them told me that they're teaching harvard classes, so why change the material? plus, they don't have time to write new syllabuses and teach different material for the same subject."
763,"> yes, hence ""have had a break after an associates, incompelte undergrad""

graduate students do not have an incomplete undergrad nor can they enter with only an associates, hes graduate programs require a full bachelors degree. 

>it's harvard courses offered for non-traditional students who have had a break after an associates, incompelte undergrad, or no college to pursue a career.

i interpreted this as ""it enables those with no college to pursue a career"" but i wanted to point out that many of them already are in their careers."
764,"the oldest son was a decent fencer, and had competed at a higher level before he came to harvard and competed for three years. not like usc where people who had never played a sport were suddenly recruited athletes."
765,"stay away from the pre-professional organizations, including the crimson, finance clubs, hccg, and so on. not to say that there aren't nice people in these clubs, but the proportion is going to be lower, and most people are going to have their game face on anyway.

i loved my experience with harvard taekwondo and aadt."
766,"club sports, also after housing day you don't have to wait to be a part of the house community, and i had a great experience investing in that.  never did any of the affinity groups but i agree the farther you stay from pre-career the more chill they'll be.  also see if you can meet anyone from the co-op / drop by: [https://dudleyundergrad.harvard.edu/co-op](https://dudleyundergrad.harvard.edu/co-op) i never knew anyone from there but the people i knew who hung out there / went to their parties were awesome, very chill."
767,a drinking team with a lacrosse problem: harvard club lax. 
768,"i have personally had a wonderful experience with the outdoors community at harvard. outing club runs trips where people can get outside for a day for the sole purpose of enjoyment and making friends.

organizations that have altruistic interests are also wonderful places for meeting compassionate people! pbha programs or public service-related clubs (e.g. engineers without borders or conservation society) have great communities.

besides that, making friends with entrywaymates and housemates is really rewarding, as these people know you in a non-academic setting and can serve as your family and home base :)"
769,"from my experience and from the responses here, i think the problem isn’t the students that are in the groups, rather it’s the situation the students are in. club sports are great because it’s explicitly non-academic/professional so the natural competitiveness of harvard students drops significantly."
770,"i don't know; harvard's a decently large school with a fairly fragmented social scene (at least, that's my impression). i haven't had any luck just passively finding nice, chill people."
771,"you’re really not alone in that my freshman fall suuuuuuuuucked and i found more of my people freshman spring through joining a sorority and getting closer with my blocking group but harvard is a hard place to be and many people are less than genuine. i can say though for real that freshman fall was the worst. i’m still not loving it, but it’s better. feel free to message me @whoever "
772,i don't see how this is relevant to issues with the harvard social scene...
773,depends on your definition of harvard's social scene. many people have many different ideas of this definition. 
774,that’s usually false humility. like the sickening attitude of so many harvardians when playing the “i go to school in boston...well near boston...across the river” game. 
775,"“...it’s still important for the rest of the world to know that you go to harvard.”

no, it really is not.  it’s just sad that anyone would think otherwise."
776,i would imagine that falsely reporting a harvard degree vs actually providing a transcript and degree verification doesn't do anything more for these people other than fluff themselves up. i seriously don't understand how these folks cannot understand the difference between a degree and a weekend certificate either. the latter shit doesn't show up on your transcript because it doesn't earn credits.
777,"i found a therapist a few years ago who was very excited that i was an alum. i wasn't sure why. she claimed that she had gone to harvard. i had asked what year, and she just went on to say she also went to tufts and neu.  
after a little digging, i found out she did a week-long program at hms... and to this day continues to tell people she went to harvard. i know that people who go to hes also put this on their resumes and linkedin."
778,"one of the best things about harvard is also one of the worst things - they offer thousands of courses per semester that many students struggle to narrow down to 4.

while i agree that one should not take a freshman seminar just for the hell of it, and also agree that it is not a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" experience, they can add value.

 if you have a strong interest in the topic or the instructor **and** taking a freshman seminar does not prevent you from taking a course needed for your concentration, then apply for the seminar. if not, don't. 

plis, a lot of these seminars are taught by tenured faculty who have crafted the seminar as one of their academic interests or personal interests,so they are really passionate about the topic. there are not that many opportunities for first years to potentially learn from a full professor is a class with only \~12 people. if the seminar is in a potential concentration, the course **may** apply to the concentration.

i was fortunate to have taken 2 freshman seminars, each of which was in a totally different area from my concentration, and they were among my two best classes."
779,"exactly, our freshman seminars at my uni 100+ people. smaller groups foster conversation, and allow people to get comfortable with their new environment, and as you said a lot of people came from hs were that want available, but also harvard has a lot of international students..or at least it did a little while ago."
780,"not a christian, but happy to talk with them.  pm me for more info if you like. an important note for them: harvard is free if your parents make under $60k or so, and it’s a sliding scale up to 10% of income for families making $150k-ish."
781,"did they get a likely letter, or an acceptance? admissions decisions came out a while ago. regardless, send them over to our [student discord,](https://discord.gg/4mjvcnp) we’ll set them straight.

you may also want to share with them this [financial aid info.](https://ofr.harvard.edu/pages/financial-aid)"
782,"here is a better site for financial aid info. right on the front page it says that 100% of students can graduate debt free. https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid

the other thing to pass on is the graduation rate. almost all schools have a lower graduation rate, so who wants to go to a cc and not graduate or a free school where you will graduate."
783,"i think the real difference here is are the two options literally harvard and a random local cc in the us. in that case it’s a no brainer, kid should go to harvard because they are not comparable. 

if we start going more the “kid got into the honors program at the state school which is top 10 in the country for major of choice,” well you can start having discussions about what else matters in a college experience. that really doesn’t sound like what’s going on though."
784,""" there is a mom on this thread saying they know lots of harvard grads who work at starbucks with 6 figures of debt ""

\-depends on your major though i dunno where she is seeing these crimson grads with 6 figure debt working at starbucks by the droves. i don't know what a ""likely letter"" is...did they get accepted or not?"
785,"you should definitely put a comma after harvard

edit: wait actually dont "
786,"i know the only reason i got in was because i had an influential donor write me a letter. now it was my accomplishments that even put me in the running and provided me access to the donor, but that was the factor that tipped the scales. do i care? no. i have a harvard diploma and i fit in just fine there. view it or not, you got in. don’t short change yourself!"
787,"i wouldn't. it sounds more like a very strong impostor syndrome to me. i also don't have any idea why i was allowed to enter harvard; i have been told my whole life that i wasn't good enough. and yet, here i am. i'd think about that and revisit how you see yourself. apparently, you were accepted...i assure you, harvard only wants candidates who are willing to put in the effort and succeed. i think that's what they saw, more than anything. cheers."
788,nah skip it. you're bigger than your admission to harvard. you don't need whatever validation it may/may not give you
789,"don't harvard students typically encourage people to explore/confront their privilege? given the racism that asian americans face in harvard admissions, i think it's laudable that some people are at least willing to acknowledge how they might have benefited from it."
790,"here’s how i see it, and i’d love for someone to disagree:


harvard has traditionally had a white alumni base. harvard, regardless of what it says publicly, admits legacies more frequently than legacies. so it’s likely that whites are admitted more than minorities due to legacy status, all else equal.

harvard has a ton of athletes. i was an athlete myself, and while there are sports asians are well-represented in, i don’t think many would disagree with me that other minorities and whites are more represented in intercollegiate sports than asians, but i will stress that *this is only from casual observation and i could be overstating how much this is true.* but, if it is true, whites and non-asian minorities are admitted more frequently than asians due to sports, all else equal.

harvard does admit students from tough backgrounds. overwhelmingly these are non-white and non-asian students. so again, non-asian minorities are admitted more frequently than asians due to circumstance-affected admissions, all else equal.

so it seems to me that asian students are caught in between traditional factors that favor whites and progressive factors that could benefit asians but more likely benefit non-asian minorities more, leading, in my view, to fewer asian admits than there “should” be."
791,"think about it this way- harvard accepts a tiny fraction of all graduating seniors- the admissions staff isn’t using process of elimination because they would be left with a group of qualified students many times larger than they can actually admit— this is what bacow meant in his email this week when he talked about affirmative admission (different term than affirmative action!) essentially, students are getting selected *in* based on some outstanding criterion. since we know there are certain groups in the us who have been historically disadvantaged, it seems pretty reasonable for admissions to favor, for example, a female hispanic candidate over a white male candidate for a given “spot” if they’re both qualified. at some point, admissions is going to need to make relatively arbitrary decisions to chose between the many 4.0-earning, all-state [athlete/musician/etc.]s who have held leadership positions and performed community service- why not use it as a chance to level the playing field and correct some historic wrongs? "
792,"i'm going to make a guess... harvard will become 80% asian students, and the rest would be white, if we go via academic results. "
793,"i think this would be completely true based on data from 50 years ago. going off the slowly rising diversity of the incoming classes, with 2022 having an unprecedented majority non white student body, we see the alumni pool becoming more and more diverse as well. given this, i wouldn't necessarily refute your point that legacy students are majority white as of now, but we can see the system becoming more refined and less biased in that sense. 

when it comes to athletes, we first need to clarify the comparably very small amount of recruited athletes. out of all the athletes in class of 2022, only 12% were recruited. when we see the sports mainly focused at harvard, let's use football, the dominant players are not primarily  asian for a variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors, although there are notable exceptions. again, i wouldn't necessarily refute your point but it's skewed to fit the narrative presented in the case. 

if we're going to mention athletes, we also need to mention other extracurriculars not directly recruited for but definitely an important aspect of an application. based on the cost prohibitive aspect of music careers, we could assume whites and asians are more favorable candidates. but again, not meaning to further skew data as i'll explain later, and unfortunately harvard doesn't directly offer data sets on it. 

when saying ""tough"" backgrounds it's racially insensitive to suggest the overwhelming majority are non white and non asian, as over half of the class of 2022 are on financial aid. it might seem as if different demographics fit into the ""tough"" background stereotype but plenty of asian students are unfortunately in that situation as well and there's no definite data to back up the point of view that these students are primarily non asian or non white, just stereotypes. 

and if we take a look at the lawsuits, none of these points are really brought up. the main argument is that they're discriminated on the basis of character. for some reason, data is skewed against asian applicants in character scores where whites and other ethnicities consistently score higher. the admissions office seemed to display a pattern of assigning lower scores to asian applicants basically calling them ""uninteresting"". the debate is wether the systematic lower scores of these asian applicants are based on a bias against them based off stereotypes such as""tiger parents"" or coincidentally, asian applicants seemingly lack personality based off cultural factors that pressure them in the college application process. 

the factors you've described are constantly being accounted for by the admissions office and should ideally not exclude asian applicants. while i don't think harvard is necessarily racist in their aa methods, they do raise questions as to the factors being weighed in scoring asian applicants based off character. "
794,"hi! disagreement! it's a good theory but it doesn't pan out.

the analysis for the defense (harvard) is done by professor card (of berkeley), for the plaintiffs, professor arcidiacono (of duke). arcidiacono’s baseline sample excludes individuals who enjoy highly preferential treatment in admissions (e.g. legacies, athletes) and the many individuals who have probability 0 of admission based on observables. card includes all applicants in the sample. that's analogous to studying the effect of a minimum wage law, except that instead of constructing the employment-to-population ratio of a subpopulation likely to be affected, you include the entire population (including individuals who have probability 0 of employment, like infants, and people making tons of money). interestingly, the infants don't seem to react to the minimum wage law, so our results are attenuated toward 0.

(p.s.- there are a lot of other more complicated things in card's use of the data that is unorthodox to say the least. such as including individuals for whom covariate x does not matter attenuating the true effect of covariate x on those individuals for whom it does matter and refusing to accept a panel data study because supposedly admissions processes differs year-to-year (really?). running separate regressions for a bunch of years, failing to reject the null in those separate regs, and claiming an overall null result is highly suspicious.)"
795,"you have a good hunch, and it seems like the [best statistical analysis confirms your suspicions](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/diverse-education/files/expert_report_-_2017-12-15_dr._david_card_expert_report_updated_confid_desigs_redacted.pdf) that the observed effect is attributable to legacy/athlete effects. 

for a much better analysis than i could do, see dynarski's thread on card's analysis (and plantiff's responses) [here](https://twitter.com/dynarski/status/1007632595641946113?lang=en). but, tl;dr, adding in those variables (and a few others) to the regression eliminates the discrimination observed by sffa."
796,"i’m not a harvard student, but i looked over admitted applicants’ profile as i applied there last year. from what i’ve seen, legacy(without donation) plays a very little role compared to ethnicity."
797,i seem to remember that most black people admitted to harvard come from wealthy and privileged backgrounds. and considering that poor white people are one of the most common demographics in the united states - among all impoverished people 40% are white - you would expect a lot more of the disadvantaged groups at harvard to be white if harvard was actually being fair in the way they admit.
798,"> tl;dr, adding in those variables (and a few others) to the regression eliminates the discrimination observed by sffa.

sorta, card's analysis says if you include non-quantifiable measurements harvard uses to evaluate applicants, it explains the discrimination...

which doesn't hold much water when, we are talking about how non-quantifiable traits are the way they are discriminating against asians.

"
799,"i’d say that legacy status goes into the black box of harvard admissions along with other qualitative considerations so that there’s really no way to *prove* who is given priority, but you might find it slightly suspicious after spending four years on campus how many students you meet with family who are alums."
800,"they also happen to score the ""personal characteristics"" of latino applicants higher than that of white applicant, and black applicants higher than latino applicants. i am not saying it's impossible for different demographics to have personalities of various degrees of desirability to harvard, ranked in that that exact order, but i do find it extremely convenient that the final outcome of such scoring resulted in a stable racial makeup for over a decade, which looks remarkably like a quota system to an outside observer like myself."
801,"i agree we should be suspicious of harvard's use of non-quantifiable traits -- as an asian undergrad here, i spent a decent amount of time thinking about this -- but this comment is somewhat disingenuous.

for example, just adding ""legacy"" and ""athlete status"" to the model eliminates the discrimination observed by sffa. these are ""quantifiable"" in it that they're y/n questions for an applicant that increase their chances of getting in by some amount, not unlike the way 10 extra points on the sat would.

if a white non-legacy non-athlete has the same chance of getting in as an asian non-legacy non-athlete given identical test scores/extracurriculars, that's hardly discrimination.

i agree that we should be sus"
802,"i did, a couple of times. let's examine the logic:

> since we know there are certain groups in the us who have been historically disadvantaged, it seems pretty reasonable for admissions to favor, for example, a female hispanic candidate over a white male candidate for a given “spot” if they’re both qualified. 

if that was the case, then logic would suggest that given the applicant pool size wouldn't, say, hispanics be the largest group as they've managed to overcome the greatest social difficulty? yet they account for only 12% of the accepted pool. 

out of 42,000 applicants and 1950 accepted, that's 228 hispanic students accepted compared to 975 white students, or a rough 4.3:1 ratio.

and wouldn't that suggest that all else being equal, the majority of harvard students would come from disadvantaged backgrounds or overcame poverty? the reality is a far cry from that. 

my response to that is, wouldn't it make far more sense just to make it an *actual* meritocracy? they already examine social background (plenty of white socially disadvantaged students), parental income, read background and supplemental essays, examine high school school's average standardized test scores, and all of that. they can clearly see who has overcome adversity without setting artificial boundaries of ""we are only going to accept x number of students of this ethnicity this year"".

why not make it an actual meritocracy? as you said, admission teams aren't using a process of elimination. they can simply say ""let's choose the best 2000 students of this group"" and make it actually fair by eliminating something that really has no reflection on their academic or social capability. 
"
803,"you are assuming that affirmative action means that applicants are being considered as a member of a racial group instead of holistically as an individual (or at least that’s what i’m inferring from your use of summary statistics and ratios.) these are irrelevant because admissions *doesnt* look at all of the students in a demographic and compare them to each other. if harvard was using a quota system you’d be absolutely correct, but that is not the case. 

it’s also important to consider that there is no objective way to pick the “best students” — a lot of this debate assumes that grades and test scores make someone “better” or more qualified when it is just the case that since these measures are quantitative and therefore easier to work with (though the accuracy of these measurement tools is also debatable!)"
804,"i still haven't heard the argument for why race plays a role in light of all the other far more complete data, aside from their attempts to sustain an image of artificial diversity at the cost of .

given that harvard has all the other background information regarding the applicant's financial background, location, high school, extra curricular, does a white student who suffered through poverty  thereby suffer less or more than an hispanic or asian student who experienced the same thing?  if their argument is that asian students aren't as participatory in sports or leadership, why not just exclude *students, regardless of ethnicity* who did not display athletic or leadership skills?

education should be a meritocracy without artificially capped limitations. the best argument against future racial discrimination is to eliminate race from the consideration. "
805,"we are. it was discussed quite a bit for decades and it's been debated that it needs to stop. harvard has been long criticized for it and personally i don't believe in it either.

again, i'll use mit as a comparison, as they don't care about legacy status and still haven't burnt down yet. "
806,"you're last paragraph is entirely misguided. don't look at mit because they aren't race blind, look at the california university system where affirmative action isn't used. it's exactly what you describe people's fears are. to determine admissions strictly on merit, completely ignores the holistic aspect of the admissions process harvard prides itself in. also, one of the only reasons i'd give as to why a poor hispanic or black student has more to overcome than a poor white student, it'll be the institutionalized racism the white student will never face. look at the disparity between sat score averages among ethnicities. standardized units of academic merit are currently flawed. "
807,"neither of those are diverse, but with a historically racially biased school like harvard, 40%+ is diverse. "
808,"harvard divinity school acceptance rate is about 15%-20% for doctorate and about 35% depending on which master’s program (mdiv, mts). obviously the doctorates are sub 20%, masters programs are generally less selective and the class profiles show).

harvard kennedy school is in the 20%-35% range depending on which program

harvard extension school is 32% acceptance rate

harvard graduate school of education is in the 25%-40% acceptance range. wide range due to the many different 1-year program concentrations.

gsas phd, business school, medical school, and harvard college have the most selective rates.

despite all that, every person i have met on campus has been a unique and interesting individual and i believe they belong here. i may not agree with vp pence’s views, but it is not fair to accuse his daughter of what you are assuming, nor fair to make assumptions or question why or how someone is a student here."
809,remy isn't a stray. but we do have a lot of stray harvard turkeys on campus!
810,"countries like canada take help from the university of toronto and several third-parties such as wes to validate transcripts and degrees. i have been fighting a losing battle for over a month with them because the graduate certificates awarded by harvard are not up to their image standards. will we, in the future, be seeing harvard working with third parties to ensure that this is a seamless process for alumni? maybe a way to send transcripts and certificates electronically for each school?"
811,harvard uses [https://nscverifications.org/](https://nscverifications.org/) for third party verification. companies can verify degrees and transcripts.
812,"companies can. but countries like canada have specific guidelines. many universities across the world get their degrees attested faster than harvard...

edit: fixed typos"
813,i’ve never heard of harvard awarding these. can you link to the harvard graduate certificate program?

816,"i’m a current harvard college student thinking about taking a semester off in the fall. after half a semester of online classes, i can confidently say that zoom classes don’t hold a candle to the community at harvard and the friends you’ll make. don’t waste your freshman fall on zoom."
817,"there is a petition and letter going around to the president of harvard to postpone the semester instead of doing it online. signed by class of 2024 and classes 2020-23 can sign too

it has over 500 signatures and you can find it in the facebook group"
818,"i agree with this statement, what would you be doing in your gap year? i could also understand deferring if harvard was the only school doing distance learning but everyone is going to be in the same situation. 

plus you would be delaying graduation by a year and in my opinion, when the world turns upside down like this, there will be opportunities for those who land on their feet and can find those opportunities in the rubble."
819,you should learn this now; harvard admin will disappoint you—constantly
820,"> personally, i love this school. i love the people, i love the resources, and i love the culture. i feel like going here was the best choice that i ever made in my life. that being said, it’s not for everyone, so do some soul searching.  

i loved it while i was there, too. amen to almost all of that.

seems what op is referring to is the current covid situation and not being able to experience any of those great things you've mentioned due to the remote-learning model harvard (and everybody else) is using to deliver its content right now and in the near future.

i don't know op, but i didn't read ""harvard is potentially not for me."""
821,"people have touched on the social and emotional bits in this thread. lots of great comments. i guess i'll talk about academics. 

in terms of broader academic tips: harvard is a much more fulfilling and worthwhile place when you know what you want to study and what you want to pursue after college. you'll be able to tailor your experience starting from day one to maximizing your success in your concentration and connections in your department (especially if you want to do things like research). you don't need to be a super academic person for this to be important for you. whether you want to spend time on academic research, industry career opportunities, politics/policy, art and creative pursuits, etc, once you know what you really want, you'll be able to pour time and go in depth on that thing and not waste too much time running around everywhere else. and time at harvard is very valuable. it's 8 semesters and you're out. i'm a senior and it's crazy to me how quickly the time flew by.

exploration is good! i am not at all trying to discourage that. i have done my fair share of curiosity driven exploration in creative writing here, even though i am stem focused. but as far as primary pursuits go, i know people who have run around the whole gamut of concentrations and opportunities, and while it's more or less worked out for them in the end, their time at harvard has been much more stressful and a little less worthwhile than it could have been. the freedom harvard affords you with your curriculum is great, obviously, but it's sometimes a curse when you can't figure out what you exactly want to do. other colleges with more stringent major requirements lock you in early on, which i think for some people is strangely beneficial.

maybe you are already very sure what you want to do. but if not, try to narrow your interests to a couple things prior to arriving, and explore those things while you're here. keep an open mind, and try to identify things that you feel really excited and motivated to work on! but do so by keeping in mind that it will be best to commit to something early on. 

in terms of less broad, more detailed, day to day academic tips, my advice is sorta common sense, but something i wish i had really stuck with early on (common sense isn't so common lol): 

1. go to class, all the time. connect with your professors and faculty by going to their office hours; they want to spend time with you and discuss the material, and you will love your education so much more for it. some are intimidating, but embrace the discomfort and go talk to them. you'll be surprised at how few of your peers actually do this. you'll thank yourself when you're searching for recommendations later on. 
2. start your work early; assignments are going to get much harder and more involved, and you'll need to spend time grappling with questions. this ain't high school work anymore. in most cases, your academic success will start to depend less on your innate intelligence and more on your diligence in starting work early and getting help in office hours.
3. make sure you understand things yourself when you are working with others. in some really hard classes here, i see people routinely just getting trickle down answers from the few geniuses in class or generous tas in office hours (cough cough cs124). working together is great and all, but try to make progress yourself first before seeking assistance. 
4. the timeline for locking down summer opportunities/internships seems to get earlier and earlier every year. start thinking about summer stuff the fall before summer (and if you're into finance and tech stuff, start the spring of the year before the summer in question -- i know, it's ridiculous).
5. practice time management skills prior to arriving by using a planner and/or online calendar, and find out how to do work in a style that best accommodates you (i'm a big proponent of the pomodoro technique). it's still going to be difficult adjusting if you are the type to push yourself. but most get the hang of this throughout freshman year; you'll be fine. 
6. try not to take more than 2 highly demanding courses each semester. sometimes this will be hard, especially because more often than not courses are only offered during fall or spring, not both, and there may be courses you don't want to delay taking. if you plan on taking 3 (or god forbid 4) demanding courses, cut your other obligations. you will thank yourself so much for it. you will do bad work if you are constantly sleep deprived from excess obligations (not to mention you will be miserable too).

i fully admit that academics are the most important thing to me here. not everyone cares this much about school, and that's totally fine. and some will disagree with me that early specialization is important; that's fine too, but the point stands that you will get better at something the more time you spend on it. these are the things i really wish someone had told me before i came. i turned out fine and will be going to a great grad school, but i could have avoided lots of stress by following the above."
822,"look all the comments on here will remind you of the importance of opening days and what not, and it is true that friend groups form quickly! but most of that is random, and you can't really beat yourself up over that. i would tell my freshman self to take advantage of my common room more and invite people over. you really only meet people by putting yourself out there, this is not false.

&#x200b;

but! be yourself! i know this sounds straightforward but harvard is a really intimidating place, people initially seem fake (a nonnegligible percantage of them stay that way) and cold (especially if you're really foreign to the new england way of things as i was), but don't try to pretend to ""fit in"". harvard has all sorts of people and there is no way you don't fit in. so don't be afraid to be yourself."
823,"i'm a harvard senior, and i highly resonate with your post. you hit the nail on the head with the second paragraph. it's hard to understand how you will feel here until you're here. in high school, i tried to mentally prepare myself for the environment here since i knew i was gonna try to push myself from day one, but until you get here and you're having trouble keeping up with advanced courses, your gpa is .2 points lower than you need it to be, not all harvard labs are excited to take you on, internships reject you left and right, your sleep schedule sucks, etc. it's a degree of inadequacy most will likely have never felt prior to coming to harvard. but you learn to live with it, accept it, and move on. i suspect much of the ""sophomore slump"" has to do with this withdrawing from school when all this sadness hits you. but my friends and i all sort of had a resurgence junior year."

825,"my pleasure! glad you found it helpful. i am first gen, low-income, immigrant as well, so i know how you are feeling, and i especially prefer being realistic to people about harvard (i find that a lot of the more idealistic advice about academics and careers tend to come from people whose families are well off). 

you use my.harvard to find classes, and you will see a link to a class's ""course evaluations"". every semester when you finish a class, you rate the class and its instructors, log how much time you spent on it each week outside of class, and write a review on it. this data is published in the course evaluation system, so you'll be able to see it for each semester the class has been offered. there are classes where the average workload is 2hrs a week, and there are classes where it is over 25 hours a week (for one class!!!). you'll see all this in the course evaluations. this is also how you can tell if a class is actually good/well taught, i.e. if its overall score is greater than or equal to 4/5, and if the reviews are mostly positive. but most people will take some intro classes which have sub-4 ratings that you have to take because they're concentration requirements; there's no way around this but it won't dominate your experience."
826,"wow, that seems so much more realistic than the more idealized harvard environment i imagined."
827,i was todd once & now all my relatives keep asking me when i’m dating a harvard girl again. fuck. me.
828,"https://library.harvard.edu/spaces

also, if you explore the basement of widener i think the 'd' floor has an underground tunnel that connects to the pusey library, and from there, you can go down another floor. it's a pretty good bet you'll find some peace and quiet."
829,"aside: this was crossposted from /r/cfb, which has a surprising number of harvard fans on it. definitely a subreddit worth checking out if you're interested in crimson football in general!"
830,"i think this was a great response to the situation - he told the community harvard's history of his donations, which honestly isn't bad considering that he wasn't known to be a sex offender or anything at that time. when the allegations came out, harvard rejected his donation, which is the appropriate response, especially in contrast to mit media lab. i think harvard did a job well done with this."
831,"a few things the statement doesn't address: 
* there are indications that epstein continued to make donations beyond the fl conviction, including to harvard’s theater troupe and a nonprofit linked to elisa new[[1]](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-epstein-has-a-secret-charity-heres-who-it-gave-money-to). * continued interpersonal relationships between epstein and harvard faculty after the fl conviction [[1]](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-science-professors-kept-meeting-donor-jeffrey-epstein-despite-his-n1028536) * the 8.9m figure doesn't include donations harvard has admitted epstein ""facilitated"", including the donation that funded rosovsky hall [[1]](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/9/13/epstein-wexner-hillel/). * accusations of abuse implicating faculty members marvin minsky [[1]](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/9/20798900/marvin-minsky-jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-island-court-records-unsealed) and of course (the devil himself) alan dershowitz."
832,"the university is responsible for the university, not every organization affiliated with it or every single thing harvard faculty do, this is a part of academic freedom. [marvin minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marvin_minsky)'s harvard ties are not relevant; he graduated from harvard college in 1950 and was a junior fellow (whatever that means) before he joined the faculty of mit in 1958."
833,"edit: i didn't realize this would be such a controversial point. please allow me to clarify. 

as president, you set the tenor and helm the university. i believe that bacow is qualified to do so, as are a great deal of the other candidates. i am not opposed to his nomination in any way. i would only like it if someone who is not a white man was nominated, someone who can understand the positions of a black or brown person, and better adjust policy in that way. harvard has a lot of institutions that were made without minority groups in mind, and some legacy things that are specifically built on the backs of enslaved minority groups. i'm not saying that harvard remains guilty of racism. my point is that never once, never once, has there been a president who has been able to specifically empathize and guide policy looking out for minority groups on campus. that is the reason that one might oppose him, not because of what his qualifications are, but because of the passing over of minority candidates who would do an equally good job. this is not me saying i believe the selection board was racially biased, nor that it should be. i am merely expressing regret that a thing i wanted to happen didn't happen, and i feel as though the response has been both out of character for the harvard community i know, and informed by my own comment, which was poorly worded. i apologize if you were misled by my original comment, but if you are still offended by the sentiment of my clarification, i would love to talk about why in a constructive setting.

end of edit.

nothing specifically against him, he seems remarkably qualified in the ways you've pointed out, but i would have liked to see a person of color and/or another woman as president. 

that being said, i, similarly to /u/hia10 , wish him the best of luck and wish the best for the university."
834,"bacow is a highly competent campus politician, and will see harvard through whatever agenda he decides on.

if that agenda doesn't match what you think is in harvard's best interest, however, you'll curse the day you first heard his name."
835,"[this article has an interesting view on eldo that many have been discussing.](http://harvardpolitics.com/hprgument-posts/eldo-kim/) [in particular, i thought i'd share one of the top comments.](http://wetheda.blogspot.com/2013/12/my-thoughts-on-eldo-kim.html)"
836,"harvard was already completely online, these schools were doing some hybrid thing. all harvard is doing now is offering housing."
837,the writing is on the wall at this point. you should definitely be making plans for harvard shutting down.
838,as a harvard student i wish to volunteer for studies
839,"i had a really tough time soph year not bc of the school, but some specific folks & happenings, and always thought about what life might have been like at stanford or down the street. however, now as a senior, i finally understand that a lot of how i am and how this place feels depend on what i make of it/my attitude/ how i prioritize things/ who i surround myself with/ what i choose to do with my time.

once i get over that and reach this understanding, i’ve enjoyed harvard a whole lot more."
840,this post kinda inspires me as a penn deferee who would rather go to harvard but didn’t apply bc it’s too selective lol. 
841,"might just be a ""grass is greener on the other side"" thing: from talking to a friend a mit, he says that having chiller classes would be nice and having a more well-rounded student body would have made for a more fulfilling experience.

that said i don't disagree about the whole vapidity thing, but i don't think it's exclusive to harvard as it is to all our peer schools."
842,"> the general attitude of ""sleep is for the weak,""

i feel like harvard can be like that too though.

"
843,why don’t you want to go to penn? what attracts you more to harvard?
844,i attended radcliffe in the '70s and '80s. there were no sororities. the heraldry doesn't look like anything i associate with harvard but i could be wrong.
845,"i don’t know if there are any now, but there certainly weren’t any harvard or radcliffe sororities in the 70sz"
846,"i believe some branches of fraternities and sororities were formed but they aren't recognized by harvard. a relatively recent rule that forbids students from joining single-sex social organizations was aimed primarily at the snobby finals clubs, many of which are still all-male, but it affected greek organizations too and they sued.

 [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/harvard-sued-fraternities-sororities-over-single-sex-rule-n942961)"
847,"yes, i'm sure there were no sororities when i was at harvard, or technically, when i was there, harvard-radcliffe. afaik, there were no fraternities either. everyone lived in the yard, the houses, or off-campus. i'm not talking about the final clubs."
848,"maybe but why? everyone i know who did or does advanced standing regrets it. harvard isn’t just about getting degrees or racking them up. it’s about learning from those around you and truly having a transformative and unique college experience. your connections, social life, and ability to be involved will suffer if you do advanced standing or their concurrent masters."
849,"it's possible. you can graduate in as few as 2.5 years without any advanced standing if you overload on classes (5-6/semester) and do summer school (3/summer). you have to petition the ad board to do this but if your grades are okay they'll approve. i probably wouldn't advise that - the person i know who graduated early that way regretted it. enjoy your time in college, it'll be some of the best of your life, and harvard is a great place to be. that said, sticking around all four years and landing a masters would be equally possible using that method."
850,"right now i'm in my first year at the college, and when i came in i had similar questions about advanced standing. however, within a week it became clear that advanced standing really isn't something to worry about.

you don't even declare a.s. freshman year. the only thing a.s. might affect your first year are class choices (because you don't want too many courses that are already covered by ap credit).

a.s., while requiring aps, is something to consider once you're more familiar with harvard."
851,"just throwing another perspective in: 3 of my close friends did it and really loved it. so i guess not everyone regrets it.

that said, i think people who enjoy it tend to be on another level. these three were (quite literally) among the top 10 physics / math students in the country. is this you, op?

the vast majority of very motivated harvard students don't do it. i think this says something. but if you really want to, more power to you. don't let anyone on reddit stop you."

855,"using this thread for a quick q: what's your favorite ""hidden gem"" restaurant at/near harvard? will be looking for some good eats when i visit in a few weeks for sure"
856,"i have a couple questions:
1.what is the environmental science and public policy program like at harvard? i'm comparing the environmental program to other schools so i would love to hear specific examples.
2. what do harvard students do during harsh winters? 
3. is the social experience at harvard similar to a typical college?
4.what does the atmosphere of harvard feel like? (both academically and socially)"

865,"it’s because they made a deal with the city of cambridge that the space must be open to the public and for the public, not just harvard students"

i totally get your concerns. even being online primarily, i wanted my harvard id. i’ve worked my entire academic career to get to this point and i wanted to go to harvard haha, the emotional ties to that little piece of plastic mean a lot. hopefully your not to far and can get it! good luck with the semester :)."

869,>yeah it's almost a guarantee every school at harvard will be online. i hope i can defer since my program needs face to face interaction. this sucks.
870,friendships at harvard aren’t important?
871,please keep an eye on this page: https://dso.college.harvard.edu/coronavirusfaq
872,"i've spent nye similarly, but i'm mentally in a better stage than you're at rn. but i've felt the way you have before.

camhs sucks. i don't blame them because they're probably overloaded with stressed out kids, but that means they'll give you the cookie cutter group therapy sessions or give you meds. it's good that you've seeked help but i'm not convinced they'll really give you the guidance you need. (my personal opinion is that you shouldn't need meds and they'll do more harm than good but i'm a luddite in this regard.)

if you look at this sub's history like a good third are kids complaining about shithole harvard so you're really not alone in this regard. a conversation a day sometimes is the solution to making this place more tolerable, so if you need someone to talk to just send a pm.

also hit the gym, no meme, it is nice because you can't think when you're trying to lift a big heavy weight. which is to say being alone in your thoughts too much makes people like us self-loathe so try to escape that."
873,"really appreciate it. i will work up a gym schedule again, i fell off my game too quickly. i think being past the adjustment stage will make it easier to keep a schedule. thanks - and love your username. that's also one of my favorite things about harvard"
874,"thanks a lot. i agree that the person you see is important - i don't feel like i really clicked with the camhs people i've seen (the first one left harvard after a couple meetings). i will see how the evaluation goes, and maybe see about people outside the school if medication isn't the right choice. thanks for the great advice."
875,"hey man, for what it’s worth, i found the first semester easily the most difficult. you hit the nail on the head of never having to study in high school. i went to uhs as i was depressed as well. i felt a lot of the same insecurities that you listed and feelings of inadequacy. it sucked. i cried when i was alone and part of me wanted to drop out. 

stick with it, work hard and make an effort to be social. everyone is going through their own struggles at this place. take comfort in going through it together. those relationships will help you, but you need to keep active and help yourself as best you can. take it one day at a time. get some exercise and fresh air. 

you’ll find your groove, your friend group and harvard will feel like home. good luck."
876,"hi! i’m a sophomore and i 100% relate to your feelings. when i got in, i thought that harvard was the happiest place on earth and that it would fix all my problems. i was wrong. i also come from a shitty public school and i was not as academically prepared as some of our peers. i didn’t know a single person before coming to campus. i developed really bad social anxiety (which i had before, but it got worse not knowing people) and that made me feel even more isolated. my grades have been so crappy and, for the first time in my life, i’m genuinely struggling academically. this semester i finally went to camhs and i’m in the process of getting an adhd diagnosis, which was previously masked but is now kicking my ass. academics haven’t gotten better for me yet... i feel you. socially, i still haven’t found a best friend or an insanely close group of friends, but i have found communities on campus and i’m building stronger relationships. this semester, i just forced myself to be more social, to reach out to people, to participate in clubs, etc. it was really scary, but i think it’s paying off. also, i don’t have summer plans yet!

i don’t know if any of that was helpful, but i just wanted to communicate to you that **you’re not alone.** there are so many people on this campus struggling, but we just don’t talk about it a lot. **be kind to yourself.** enjoy the little things**.** you’re only going to be here for a small part of your life—try to get some cool memories, but know that in the end your time here doesn’t have to define you or your future."
877,"other people already spoke well to the mental health side. here are a few logistical suggestions:

1.) take easier classes. it used to be cool in hs to take the hardest classes you could, it’s not anymore. especially if you had less academic preparation in hs, take a really easy load next semester. the q guide is your friend here. 

2.) go after unofficial summer positions and less prestigious locations/organizations. even with the harvard name, it’s really really difficult to get internships when you have to apply as a freshman. chances are, if it’s a company/organization you’ve heard of and has an online application, they’re getting 100+ applications mostly from uperclassmen. either find organizations/startups that most people haven’t heard of, or find internships that don’t have applications by emailing people at organizations you like that don’t have postings and asking to intern with them. that way you won’t be competing against 100 seniors. 

3.) join campus clubs that have multiple years of students. first year programs and friend groups are great and all, but all-frosh friend groups are fragile af and they won’t be able to help you with academic advice or navigating harvard systems. having even a few uperclassmen friends will replace what those advisors are supposedly for and will lend some stability to your social circles.

878,"i can’t help with your medical issues; see a doctor or a therapist and follow their advice. 

however, i am a harvard alum (‘99), and i can otherwise relate. before harvard, i was always the best at math and science.  i won all the awards and got straight as. then i got to harvard and realized i wasn’t all that special. i got placed in math 1b, and barely got a b in the class. i thought i’d expand my horizons and took anthropology second semester, and i got a very gentlemanly c; i think my tf thought i was straight up stupid. i finished the year with 6 bs and 2 cs. on top of that, my freshman year was the first one with the house lottery. i didn’t get invited to join anyone’s rooming block, and i realized i had no friends. 

i’m probably not helping, but i just thought i’d say that it gets better. i muddled my way through school, somehow graduated with honors (i had a b average in math, i guess). most friendships people are making are completely superficial, but the harvard part endures at least. doors will be opened, and it will all be worth it. (unless you get sent to the quad. if that happens, just drop out.)"
879,"my first semester has definitely had its rough points as well (i’m a first year). a lot of self doubt, feeling like everyone else has found their place here and i’m just left watching them enjoy their time at harvard. for me, reflecting on the good things and the people i do have in my life has made me feel a lot better. always stay optimistic and hopeful for the future. realize that the problem is not you, it’s your circumstances, and those circumstances are in your control to change. make plans, and if they don’t work out, don’t stop trying. take things a day at a time and cherish the nice moments. if your entire day sucks, then there is always the next one. i’m not sure if any of this will help, but just know you are not alone and time tends to improve things on its own sometimes. if you ever need someone to talk to who is willing to listen, send me a private message. best of luck! hang in there."
880,"> when i got in, i thought that harvard was the happiest place on earth and that it would fix all my problems. 

yikes. i think this is why it’s really important to find a mentor or at least a current student/alumni who can set you straight."
881,"life is good. i wish i got more out of harvard when i was there (took better classes, went to a football game, had an adviser who actually knew my name, etc.), but the last 20 years have been just peachy. my son is a senior in high school and applied this year. i told his guidance counselor that harvard was my alma mater and she non-sarcastically (probably?) congratulated me. how many people are still being congratulated on the college they got into almost 25 years later? unfortunately, my son got deferred without even getting an interview, so i'm pretty miffed about that."

cumulative gpas, areas of concentration, fields of study, minors, certificates, prizes, and academic awards are displayed on your harvard transcript.

master of liberal arts in extension studies

bachelor [or master] of liberal arts, harvard university extension school.

bachelor [or master] of liberal arts, extension studies, harvard university.
"
890,"personally, i list both extension studies and gsas special student on my résumé. 

yet, i doubt if i left gsas special student out of my résumé, a recruiter would rant about it. 

to me, this suggests that the 2,917 hes degree candidates sometimes face unfair hiring discrimination because they may be grouped with the 25k non-degree students and try to avoid it by leaving out the extension studies part. 

i think degree candidates should include something that distinguishes them from other schools in order to accurately attribute part of their accomplishments to hes, but should also be able to more explicitly distinguish themselves from non-degree students possibly with a degree name that reflects what they have studied, or by changing the school-name résumé guidance based on degree vs. non-degree. 

additionally, in most cases, i wouldn't call it deception, rather a way to more clearly distinguish themselves from non-degree candidates (though extreme examples like listing an ab or am are inaccurate). as long as the degree candidate is listing alb or mla, i think that should be enough to credit the extension school for a part of the student's accomplishments. admitted hes students represent 13% of harvard university degree candidates, only behind the college (30%), and gsas (19%), so listing harvard university shouldn't be an issue. i see most people throughout the university list harvard university, rather than their school, on their résumés and then list their degree (at least on wikipedia, facebook, and linkedin). hes degree candidates doing the same is not a break from university tradition."
891,"oh lord, another tale of *those damn* hes ~~students~~ grads , running around without adult supervision . look , i've seen my share of misbehaving hes students and maybe a few grads here and there but that is few and far between, lets call them pinheads. i highly doubt these pinheads (25 to be exact) are so  trifling that each and every one of them selected something other than hes in your recruiting application. sounds like its poorly designed, or is it even necessary? many others don't have separate drop downs for hes even though i appreciate when they do.

""i agree with you. at my company specifically we do a lot of recruiting at the college and hbs (separately) so maybe they hope to fall between the cracks. it doesn't work, because there's a separate step that they need to apply through the college or hbs' internal career system that gets linked to us.""

so what, you used a different method of getting resumes then your practically bulletproof method of perusing through crimson careers(?). that doesn't make a lick of sense.

regardless, as i've said before and will say into perpetuity,

if you are an extension student and your resume doesn't have extension anywhere in the name (even if you include alm), you're a fraud. stop it. take five minutes to go and fix it. now. own it, be proud of it! it's a great conversation piece!

""nope, hes is not being sued. you're thinking of the college.""

hes students and grads have nothing to be ashamed due to a couple pinheads acting foolish.

894,"they shouldn't have an associate's or bachelor's program it conflicts with harvard college and if your first bachelors degree is an hes degree well you really didn't to college yet, that encourages back door mentality. if you have a bachelor's degree from harvard 99.99% of people will assume it's from the college, that's a problem. however, the graduate program is extremely difficult and has a very low graduation rate, something like 5% and in that sense its just 1 of harvard's 13 degree granting graduate schools. the associate's and bachelor's should never be lumped in with the grad school. "
895,the guidelines specially say you can list harvard university as long as you specify that you your degree is in extension studies.
896,"i don't have issue with listing harvard university, as many phd students do this, but always include their department and usually the fact they're a phd student. the issue comes with trying to list harvard vaguely with no details as a means of deception."
897,"sorry, but respectfully disagree. you distinguish yourself from non-degree students by listing the degree you’ve earned or are in the process of earning. a non degree student at any school would not list that school’s degrees. and hes grads should be accurate in the degrees they list - i read about 25 hes resumes and only 4 or 5 listed an alm or alb. 

i don’t think everyone is trying to be deceptive, but the fact that my company is one that heavily recruits heavily at the college and hbs make me think these people were trying to act as those students, not separate themselves from non degree extension students.

the biggest problem i have with “harvard univeristy” over “harvard extension school” is that hes is a drop down option on our online app. not one person chose this option, everyone self-entered harvard university into the box."
898,"> so what, you used a different method of getting resumes then your practically bulletproof method of perusing through crimson careers(?). that doesn't make a lick of sense.

i pulled the resumes from the internal application system. the full time recruiters only get access to the harvard system, and i'm not fully sure what that looks like or what they do, since i'm not a recruiter. all i know is, i clicked filters for harvard college and noticed a filter for harvard university as well, and pulled resumes from there, and out of the hundreds that i downloaded, the 25 i got that listed harvard university were all extension. there's many more to go so maybe it's more rampant than 25, or maybe it's only the 25 i read. but 25 hes grads who have applied since july 1st is still kind of a lot, imo.

just to be clear, i'm not a recruiter for my company. i am a phd doctoral student and i just followed our recruiter's directions for what the process is, and that's how i ended up getting those resumes.

>i doubt anyone is really going to be fooled. harvard college usually have it front and center on their resume, recruiters and employers are privy to the game as well, if hc is what they desire.

i agree with you here. basically any company that recruits at harvard won't be fooled, especially given the on-campus interviewing portion that coveted positions have."
899,"hes has been around for a hundred years or so but is still relatively unknown on campus. they grant degrees but put ""liberal"" in the title. whereas students of the college/gsas earn an ab/am, extension grants the ""alb"" or the ""alm."" 

it started out as a way to outreach and provide affordable education to the surrounding community but has more recently morphed into a ""back door"" into harvard. the diplomas look identical except for the word ""liberal"" in the degree name, and they graduate at regular commencement with all the other schools. the main difference (and what causes the controversy) is that the admission rate is higher than all the other harvard schools, but that doesn't matter to most employers outside the new england area who aren't familiar with the difference. it's a legit harvard degree and the h-bomb magic works the same, but anyone geographically close to the campus or in the know will understand the difference. maybe some think the quality of the student is different, but i say that if the work was done and harvard sees fit to give them the seal of approval, then so should we.

from what i understand, there are a ton of people that sign up for open courses through hes, but not many actually graduate with degrees. it's bs for someone to sign up for an open course and claim to have attended. i do, however, say bully for the ones that actually get admitted and graduate, they should be proud of the accomplishment...but they do need to abide by the guidelines of the school. they're allowed to say they are graduates of ""harvard university,"" but the degree is written as alb or alm, which denotes the difference. it would be ""harvard university, alb '18"" as opposed to ""harvard college, ab '18."" clear as mud?"
900,">do folks feel the same way about law and business school graduates who dont specify their specific school on linkedin/resumes?

i'm the op, and i don't think listing ""harvard university"" alone is a bad thing. i do it, some people in the college do it, many faculty who graduated from harvard do it. for me, it's listing only harvard paired with a misleading degree or some other information and avoiding anything that mentions the extension school. in my case specifically, my company allows for applicants to select harvard extension school as their university (same goes for the college, hbs, etc) but no one did this out of the many resumes i pulled - they self entered ""harvard university"" instead."
901,anyone listing a degree from “harvard university” either has one from hes or is completely lying; anyone with degree from the college or one of the other graduate schools will list which one.
902,">i also agree that whatever degree was achieved should be listed in accordance with the guidelines. 

i think the issue most have is that the guidelines from hes mention extension in some way (either through listing harvard extension school or extension studies as the degree) and most people avoid mentioning extension at all."
903,"hes is the third largest school, with the students making up 13% of degree candidates at the university; this ""really went to harvard"" narrative is irrational and outdated (unless you also are aiming to alienate all 11,948 students or 52% of the university which are not at the gsas or college).

listing harvard university makes us easier to find relative to being pooled with the 25k non-degree candidates that also take classes at hes. students should list their alb or alm degree after identifying themselves as a degree candidate at the university if they identify themselves as such. "
904,"phds, postdocs, etc usually list harvard university, their department, and any other academically relevant appointments."
905,"i think we have a lot of common ground to agree on here. 

>you distinguish yourself from non-degree students by listing the degree you’ve earned or are in the process of earning.

true, my issue is that it needs to be more clear that earning a bachelor of liberal arts in extension studies with a field of study in government is much different than taking one course as a non-degree candidate, say, american government, and listing harvard extension school, american government on a resume. it only serves as a point of confusion for recruiters unfamiliar with how the school operates. 

> the biggest problem i have with “harvard university” over “harvard extension school” is that hes is a drop down option on our online app. not one person chose this option, everyone self-entered harvard university into the box.

for this point i would still say that its an issue of distinguishing oneself from non-degree candidates since the vast majority of students at hes are non-degree candidates. one perspective could be that if there's a 10% chance that someone listing hes is a degree candidate, but a near 100% chance that someone listing harvard university is a degree candidate, and you're a degree candidate at the university applying to jobs with recruiters that are pressed for time, why wouldn't you list harvard university to make more clear that you're degree-seeking student or an alum and make yourself easier to find? 

recruiters like yourself probably are not a fan of searching through 10 resumes in search of 1 degree candidate, so degree candidates try to make it easier on you and heighten their chances of being reviewed by categorizing themselves into a pool of candidates that they can still honestly identify themselves as (""harvard university"") and which is much more likely be filled with degree candidates. the mistake comes when they don't list their sub-category within the university to credit the extension school with their academic accomplishments. "
906,"quick question - when you selected the filter, why didn't you also pick the ""harvard extension"" filter? 

i think i know why you're getting tons of hes folks."
907,"i agree with you on all but two points. 

> the main difference (and what causes the controversy) is that the admission rate is higher than all the other harvard schools.

i feel like applying the traditional admission rate metric (the data is not available for hes in the first place) as a measure of selectivity in the case of hes fails to accurately represent the school's non-traditional admission process. 

a measure that would better allow the comparison would be the proportion of students admitted that first began courses with the intent to apply.

further, the ""application fee"" (three required courses before application submission) is around $4,350, so you would see selection bias within the applicant pool for individuals that would be very strong candidates in the first place.  

>it started out as a way to outreach and provide affordable education to the surrounding community but has more recently morphed into a ""backdoor"" into harvard.

i appreciate your knowledge of the history of hes. however, i have to disagree with you about it morphing into a ""back door"". there are no backdoor, unwarranted admissions into the university, only a diversity of paths to admission. i understand how non-traditional processes or ideas can be scary or taboo for a time, but i guarantee you the process is creating value for hes students, students at the other schools, and the university as an organization, while driving positive change in the wider educational environment. the geographic, cultural, and background diversity at hes is unmatched as is also the case with the flexibility students possess with regard to their studies.


"
908,"ok. here's my best guess as to what's going on: so, hes students do have access to crimson careers just like the college students do, and so as far as a ""path"" to interviewing, it is broader (as far as the uni is concerned) than the one your company wants. so know from the outset there is going to be some over inclusion there.

because your filter is screening for harvard university or harvard college, you aren't seeing all the resumes that contain the string ""harvard extension"", so the ones you are seeing  are just the ones where people have abstracted away this detail, so it appears to your eyes that no one wants to admit they're an hes student, when there is selection bias at work.

probably also at work is that many people have surmised or suspect that they'll get more hits if they use ""harvard university"" as a label because that is the search term people use and it isn't an untruthful statement outright so it isn't going to run afoul of most people's scruples.

and as far as the whole am / alm or ab / alb distinction some people are failing to make, well, *i* wouldn't do that because it crosses the line for me, but they are probably rationalizing that it is content-wise the same thing (ie it is a proxy for the equivalent body if course work) and it is a search term more likely to be used. i think this is more true for the ab vs the alb than the am / alm, which tends to be more specialized material, but that is probably their line of thought."
909,"i don't think this is true. a lot of phds and faculty list the harvard university on their cvs and linkedin, but have a degree/department to back up with it. the issue is usually when they're adding on a degree that doesn't make sense, those are usually hes"
910,"at the end of the day it all shakes out and the ones that graduate are deserving. the way i understand it is that the anybody can attend an hes class but to be admitted into the school you have to pass three harvard classes with a b average. and then you can start  pursuing a degree. it's kind of an interesting selection process, kind of a prove it to me approach."
911,"i don't actually know how recruiting works, as i'm not a recruiter. my company employs alumni and current students of universities to do part of the resume review though. 

at my company specifically and several other jobs i've applied, many of the points you stated are non-issues that don't necessitate differentiating hes graduates with non-degree students. i'll just speak to my company specifically.

if you're a current student (i just went through this process last year), you enter the schools you attend or attended. the next question that pops up is something to the effect where you check either degree-candidate or non-degree. so no need to differentiate there - the application already does that. you also have to upload your transcript which will also identify this difference.

this has been pretty similar to many of the job application databases i've used, including harvard's databases for both faculty and staff. my point is that most companies have the mechanism you're describing in place, not just for harvard extension but other places too (community college probably deal with this far more than hes). "
912,"my company only does on campus recruiting for hbs and the college, in partnership with each school's career services. the extension school, as well as every other grad school at harvard, does not participate in that process. i am only reviewing resumes for college on campus recruiting, so i only selected the filters to get college resumes.

if an hes, hgse, hks, law, med, etc student at harvard wants to apply to this company, they would have a completely different application/hiring process than the college and hbs."
913,"i actually do agree with the first bit. in my mind, the ones that have the money to pay for hes outright (i don't think they offer a lot of aid and i know they don't attend for free or low-cost like a lot of hc) combined with the discipline to finish the degree probably come from a background of life experience you won't find in the younger college students. 

i also didn't mean back door in a negative way. it's a total back door. i wouldn't call it ""unwarranted,"" but the fact is that it is easier to get in to harvard through hes than any other way. but i wouldn't say it's easy to make it through to graduate, and therein lies the difference. 

the gazette had an article a while back about some dude who graduated this year that came from a broken home, had a super interesting personal narrative, then spent years commuting from his home in texas while working full-time and finally finished with straight a's. that's incredible. according to the article, he is now headed off to graduate school at yale. apparently yale thinks hes is legit enough. that guy, and i'm sure most of the graduates of hes, could probably compete with the hc students as far as being smart and interesting. it seems to me they just did it later in life. 

unfortunately, there may be a stigma for those guys among more traditional members of the campus (and their employers) as they go out and seek jobs. i don't think that will bother them as they will just overcome the adversity like i suspect most of them already have. it really surprises me that any of them would lie and try to say they had an ab or am. it seems like they should be proud of what they earned. i think if the university eliminated the open-registration part of hes and only allowed people seeking admission to enroll, that would ameliorate a lot of the issue. but i highly doubt that would happen."
914,"i think that's probably a big part of it. think about all the work you did to get admitted (congrats, btw). you probably worked incredibly hard in high school and have a 4.0+ gpa, 32+ act, and some sort of ec or hook that set you apart. regardless of what got you in, you focused and worked for it for a long time. now imagine that someone else who didn't put in all the effort you did and also got admitted. how does that feel? that's essentially what harvard is doing with hes. however, i think they have to work much harder to earn the degree once they are in. i know of one guy who does it with a full time job and a family. you can't tell me he doesn't work as hard or harder than anyone else.  

keeping in mind the original point of this thread, i don't think improper formatting is the issue, lying is. i do think it's a bit much to force them to include the words ""extension"" in everything though. the difference in degree name and (i assume) the school name on their transcripts would suffice. apart from that, i view them as much a part of harvard as everyone else."
915,">does all of the distress of improper formatting largely boil down to elitism and/or harvard college folks feeling bitter because getting in was harder for them

i don't think it's as basic as improper formatting. in my small sample size, there was a decision made in the application process to not choose harvard extension school, and also many who decided to write the incorrect degree - usually ""bachelor/master of arts in xx field"" instead of ""bachelor/master of liberal arts"", and everyone excluding the ""in extension studies"" part.

i'd be bothered if i attended any university and someone tried to say they earned the same degree as me when they did not actually do so. i don't think students at the college care that much aside from brief moments on here, their interaction with students outside the college is not super common anyway."
916,">here's my best guess as to what's going on: so, hes students do have access to crimson careers just like the college students do, and so as far as a ""path"" to interviewing, it is broader (as far as the uni is concerned) than the one your company wants. so know from the outset there is going to be some over inclusion there.

i don’t know if hes students can apply to the same jobs as harvard college students because the accounts are set up differently and there are limitations to who can apply. for example on our job posting for this year, the application is only made available to college students with a march or may 2019 graduation date. so a college junior can’t apply, nor can a graduating hes student.

also, in my post specifically, i am not getting resumes from crimson careers. 

>because your filter is screening for harvard university or harvard college, you aren't seeing all the resumes that contain the string ""harvard extension"", so the ones you are seeing are just the ones where people have abstracted away this detail, so it appears to your eyes that no one wants to admit they're an hes student, when there is selection bias at work.

the way the filtering work is that in the application, you choose your school (college/hbs/hgse/hes). there is an option to fill your own option in (for applicants at schools without their own filter) and this leads to the problem i faced. hes students self enter harvard university, creating its own filter that i picked. 

moving forward i won’t be using that filter since it had only been used by hes students (and the instructions i got today for resume review make no mention of this filter - just says to check harvard college).

the big problem for me lies within the fact that hes students were not choosing the appropriate filter and self typing harvard university instead. in my view, this seems to be at best, a dumb move that you don’t choose your correct school when the option is presented, or at worst, a deceptive move to try to avoid the having hes added onto your application."
917,"> maybe it's an east coast thing to list the specific college

when they say the college they mean harvard college - many list ""harvard college"" and ""bachelor of arts, xx"". the college here doesn't have multiple colleges/schools under it like other universities."
918,"i was referring just to harvard, not universities in general."
919,"hm, if you mean only phds, and not any other graduate or doctoral degree holder, i suppose their situation can be confusing. because regardless of which school they’re in, all phds are technically conferred by fas. they might list harvard university but with their school; that extra information is key and is like adding “extension studies” for hes students.

or are you saying there are people who list an mba from harvard university, with no additional information, instead of harvard business school? are they assuming anyone would know which school offers that degree?"
920,">now imagine that someone else who didn't put in all the effort you did and also got admitted. that's essentially what harvard is doing with hes.

i graduated high-school at 16 and slept in a supply closet at a fast food restaurant and showered in the restroom for two years in order to save up enough to apply and move to cambridge all while working full-time and going to college full-time getting straight a's in the process. 

while traditional students had the luxury to work on their gpa, sat, and act scores i was out supporting myself and self-funding my entire college education because of the non-traditional circumstances i experienced. 

i think it's a bit naive to ascribe a blank slate background to hes students or assume the entire process is low-effort. even now, my efforts continue as i defend my chosen method of attaining knowledge and making a better life for my family. 

i would be curious to find out how often other students at the university have to defend their choice of trying to get an education at harvard. 


"
921,"well - i wouldn't be too hard on them, you know. job searching is tough and most people don't obsess too much over institutional details like this. i wouldn't presume an intent to deceive. to the extent they generalize their education, they might simply fear bias or being excluded in this filter-driven recruiting world, and this fear might be well founded.

i know at uchicago when i was in the mba program, there was a separate part time program that was administered separately in many ways (even though the classes were a 100% match and the degree name wasn't one letter different). yet some people in the full time program i was in thought they were somehow ""better"" or ""different"" from the part time folks. it was all mythology, a kind of tribalism. now we are in the working world, pursuing the same kinds of jobs, and some in each group have met with more or less success than others in the other group and in that sense we are all equal now.

my experience of harvard extension has had an important difference: i've never met a single harvard college / gsas student with the snooty attitude i found at uchicago. my experience has been that harvard students universally have a mature self-assurance about them - they realize that all those who wish to learn come from varied paths, there is no one ""right"" one, just as in literature there is no one ""best"" book."
922,"i mean only phds. here are [example](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bmilmanda/files/bfm_resume_august2018.pdf) cvs [that](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/cuicui_chen/files/cv_cuicui.pdf) that do this. all phds at harvard are in gsas technically anyway.

i also know a few friends of mine at the college also list just ""harvard university"" on their linkedin, but usually not on their resume."
923,"**survivorship bias**

survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. this can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. it is a form of selection bias.

survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance.

924,"i don't like the idea of banning stuff like that, but on the other hand, i don't like the idea of having it here either.  maybe a new subreddit could be spawned specifically for harvard admissions questions?  that would have the downside of there not being any actual harvard affiliates/alums to answer questions, but at least people can still *ask* them somewhere.  then again, maybe this wouldn't be a great idea.  i don't know, just throwing it out there."
925,"which is a shame. i enjoy reddit, and i love harvard, but there's nothing of value on this sub."

928,"have you actually attended yet, or are you entering for the first time this fall?  also, based on your use of ""college email"" i'm assuming you're attending as an undergrad at the college and not at the extension school.

the college student handbook says:

"" harvard student email accounts ordinarily will be made inoperable and deleted for those harvard college or graduate school of arts and sciences students who have been unenrolled for a period exceeding six consecutive terms. students will be sent a notice to the email account one month prior to the closure, and again ten and five days prior to the closure, so that students may take steps to save any material they want to preserve elsewhere. if a student re-enrolls at a later period, a new student email account will be made available.

932,"hey!  if it was a brown wallet with studs on it, i found it and turned it in to the cambridge police, since it wasn’t quite on harvard campus. if that’s the one, though, they should be able to give it back to her. if not, i really hope you find it!!!"

934,the harvard police have recommended this path to us; my husband is contacting them while i interface with our daughter.  there are a lot of moving parts when trying to help from several states away!
935,"the median family income of a student from harvard is $168,800, and 67% come from the top 20 percent. about 1.8% of students at harvard came from a poor family but became a rich adult. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/harvard-university"
936,"depending on which source you look at, somewhere between 45 and 70% of students receive some kind of financial aid. 20% of students pay nothing to attend harvard."
937,"i don’t want to speculate too much, because i don’t think there’s income data broken down by race, so most of what i’m saying is based on my own experience. 

i would say a good portion of african-american students at harvard are the children of african immigrants and they tend to be from a higher socioeconomic bracket. in my experience, those that are not, as well as hispanic students, better reflect the actual socioeconomic distributions of their populations. many of my african-american and hispanic friends are proud low-income and first-gen students. 

these may be general trends, but there’s always many many exceptions. i know plenty of asian and white first-gen students as well."
938,"thank you for your insight on harvard’s demographics, it was interesting to learn! :)"
939,wow that’s super interesting. i always thought harvard’s holistic admissions takes into account of adversity and diversity.
940,there's youth shelters in harvard square like y2y that might be able to help
941,"if you have res on desktop, enter the konami code on the /r/harvard homepage. it will make sense"
942,"this is fantastic, and i feel great for him, but i'm also puzzled. the most 'wow' thing on his application is the national merit scholar thing; everything else is pretty standard for a high-achieving high schooler. i've seen kids who made inventions for nasa, became self-made millionaires, and got into the intel finals all be rejected from the ivy league schools, especially harvard. i really want to know--why this kid? is there something incredible about him that wasn't mentioned in the story? again, he absolutely deserves this and i'm sure he'll do great at harvard, i'm just wondering why him in particular.

also, i've never really been the type to complain about affirmative action (sometimes it even seems like college admissions are biased *against* minorities), but so far there have been six news stories about kids ""getting into every ivy"" and they were all black.
"
943,wow... i figured there'd be more student outrage on reddit than what i'm seeing. there's a difference between sex positive and objectification. this was very clearly objectification and the fact that you guys think this is somehow acceptable behavior completely justifies my opinion that harvard is just another shit-tier school that's coasting on reputation.
944,only the most sexually repressed puritan would even care about this. so i guess i can see why harvard students are freaking out.
945,"even if you personally think it's acceptable, the entire team signed the student handbook, which explicitly bans this sort of behavior -- it's totally harvard's right to do this. "
946,"elite college? haha, thanks for the laugh. harvard is nothing but just another shit-tier college coasting on reputation at this point."
947,"> a fair share of posts in this subreddit are about how lonely and sad harvard students feel, the lack of a dating life, and so on.

selection bias for sure.

also club sports are mad chill."
948,"silly op, how could you worried that you will have trouble making friends at harvard? everyone at harvard is a science nerd to some extent. 

there are an endless amount of chances to make friends. start looking into some pre-orientation programs or extracurriculars now if it will put your mind at ease (do fop).

also keep in mind that the harvard subreddit is likely to give you a highly skewed perception of life at harvard. yesterday i posted about how to launder money with my crimson cash account—obviously that was a joke, i figured out precisely how to do it months ago. 

worst comes to worst you can pm in september and we will hangout if you are still friendless."
949,"those sad reddit posts are definitely an exception, not the rule. most people at harvard are very happy, whether it be with big friend groups or a few good friends. and don’t worry about people only being into social justice and liberal arts, many of those people are just more vocal at the start. in stem majors and stem classes, you’ll meet plenty of nerdy, geeky people into the same things you are. the cool thing about harvard is that pretty much everyone you meet is going to be into both stem stuff and liberal arts because of the nature of the school itself, so you’ll have things in common with almost everyone. if you still want to do stuff at mit, you can cross register for some classes there to broaden your experience. i do rotc so am at mit for that several times a week and it’s a nice change of scenery. i never had many friends in high school and i’ve been having a great time here. long story short, you’ll most likely be fine and really enjoy your time at harvard.
signed: a nerdy introvert."
950,"lots of science types at harvard and mit. lots of introverts at harvard. the experience at harvard is what you make it. if you want to do sports....harvard may not be the place for that.

make friends by going to clubs and meetups. learning to put yourself out there instead of lamenting about being lonely is an adult skill. ain't no one helping you find friends after you get out so learn to build those skills if you want to find friends because such skills will be useful in the real world."
951,"reddit is a terrible example of harvard overall, much like the internet vs real life in general. the campus is general is a pleasing mix of assholes, nerds, and wonderful and interesting people. this subreddit is a much smaller sample size and can be poisonous at times. 

tl;dr: don’t assume anything on the internet is representative of reality."
952,there’s a sample bias on /r/harvard
953,"dear op, i had the same worries last year after scrolling through r/harvard and seeing post after post about how much people didn’t like harvard. after one semester here, i can say that this has been the happiest few months of my life to date. i truly love it here, and so do many, many others, though i think everyone encounters loneliness and impostor syndrome and one point or another. and i don’t think they’re unique to this campus at all, just a part of the college experience.

with regards to science nerds, you are in great company! i’m a “cs person” myself and while there are lots of insanely talented artists and debaters and writers and other humanities kids here, there is also an amazing (and large) community of cs, math, physics, premed people as well (so many premeds...). one cool thing is that every person i know wears multiple hats: nobody is just one “type” of person—they all have diverse interests that span disciplines!

and lastly, congrats and welcome! feel free to dm me if you’d like to talk about anything (or meet up on campus sometime) :)"
954,"there's sad people at every school. trust me, if the situation were different and you were accepted into any other school, you would find a similar proportion of sad, depressed, over-stressed students. harvard's not special in that regard, and i would even say for the most part, harvard students aren't terrifically unhappy, just mostly over-committed and too worried about how we stack up against our peers.

do club sports. they're fun, low commitment, and you make great friends in them. club swim is the one that attracts the most attention.

there's a fair share of nerdy engineering people at harvard. just take nerdy engineering classes and find a good pset group. join hcs and go to their social events. join engineers without borders and hang out around seas/engineering department open houses."
955,"just to counteract the depressed self selection bias mentioned by other commenters, i’m a current student and i love it here! have a really incredible community, tight-knit authentic friends, and i’ve taken some truly life-changing classes just in my first few semesters. harvard’s helped me figure out what i want to do with my life and given me some crazy resources to get there. 

that’s not to say you should ignore the other posters, but use them as a cautionary tale for how to spend your time here and not a diagnosis for how your time will be spent. taking easy classes first semester, join low-key community-oriented clubs, proactively make study groups with people in your classes, host a couple parties early on. i’m sure you’ll love your time here!"
956,"as the author of a sad harvard post, i can tell you that i am in the minority. and that being away from campus has helped give me the perspective that–even if first semester was shitty–my situation wasn’t as hopeless as i thought.

i wasn’t proactive about dealing with my mental health in high school, and that contributed a lot too my distress at harvard. it is not a nurturing environment (in my experience) and if you feel you are struggling with your mental health now, i advise you to get it sorted sooner rather than later."
957,"harvard is definitely not the happiest or easiest school to attend, but if you love learning, all the other pitfalls won't matter."
958,"i turned down harvard for another school because they offered a full ride. schools are schools, and each is filled with a diverse group of people. everything will be okay!"
959,"the towers on top of the science center are actually condenser / cooling towers for the yard's central heating and cooling system. what you're feeling is condensed water from the steam being pumped out the top. there's an enormous tank of chilled water under the science center and three or four giant compressors.

it's possible to get the operations people to give you a tour of that and the steam tunnels, and i highly recommend it if you get the chance - harvard's infrastructure is pretty crazy."
960,"even though senior faculty members i know promise me this won't happen, i maintain harvard's best bet is to build more colleges ... having the class composed of the top 10% rather than the top 5% would be of net benefit to the university. though i'm sure scaling like that would be a non-trivial exercise."
961,"it’s better than the uk tbh. apparently you can only apply to one of oxford or cambridge, and given how hard it is to get in, they run out of good options if they’re rejected. at least here i was able to apply to the top 15 or so colleges, so if i didn’t get harvard i wouldn’t really have cared that much. i don’t think rejects get too broken up about it for that long."
962,"we're already the largest ivy league universities in some capacities (endowment, academic staff). i think, frankly, on a fundamental level, administrators are wary of this, and that's what it comes down to. 

furthermore: our size is already arguably problematic, which is why the one harvard movement is trying to address the siloed factions of this university. 

but out of curiosity: what college(s) would you add? undergrad or graduate"
963,"maybe you're right, but i think it's hard to know. there are so many faculty that maintaining a good teacher to student ratio wouldn't be hard. the number of faculty has grown way faster than the student population, which has been stable since ... what, the 50s?

do you think integrating radcliffe hurt the student experience, or do you think instead that this is a bad comparison?

what aspects of the student experience do you think might suffer if harvard increased the entering class size by, say, 10%?"
964,"when radcliffe was merged into the university, they simply added radcliffe's houses to harvard's pre-existing one. the idea i was floating (which people apparently hated, based on the score my post got), was increase the size of the college.

what i was getting at is if you look at the quality and size of the applicant pool, it seems apparent that there are way, way more people who are qualified to attend who could add something positive to their classmates' experience, than who can be admitted. this isn't news - it's just that it's gotten to an extreme level now.

gdavtor's point is well taken - there is a certain collegiality that is lost when you over-populate -- why scale up if it would cheapen the experience for everyone? and without scaling up the physical plant to match, he is correct. my line of thought was this, though: any one person's experience of harvard is going to be a product of his or her interactions with classmates, people who live in the same house, who dine together, or otherwise interact. there is no way that any one student's experience of harvard entails all 1,600 students in that person's class. were student services scaled up, you could avoid the negatives of overcrowding that might give people pause.

this would be expensive. harvard has to work hard enough to maintain the physical plant it's got, and they're not making more land in cambridge. that said, the university benefits from all these bright minds being together, and that's the counterbalancing factor. is the benefit of bringing more bright minds into the community worth all the work it would be to preserve the experience for its members?

that was the question i was trying to explore."
965,"why should harvard increase its number of students? just because more are applying doesn't mean more should be accepted. 6,700 is the balance that has been settled upon by administrators for many good reasons. 

its good that faculty grows faster than the student body. that much should be obvious. 

radcliffe is a different situation, since it had a clear purpose: making harvard coed. arbitrarily increasing the student population size doesn't have a clear purpose and just puts more strain on campus. for example, not every freshman could live in the yard, which is a hallmark harvard experience. 

also, there's a big difference between a 10% increase and doubling like you suggested before. neither are good, nonetheless. "
966,"can you stop posting these? they are really embarrassing. i watched the harvard tradition videos hoping they'd be funny or at least...something. but seeing that you've been posting for awhile and aren't stopping, i feel the need to say something. just stop. these aren't funny, or interesting. honestly, you'll probably regret these being up in the near future. "
967,"nah dude you right, on harvard time isn't funny in the slightest. i wish they'd give up too"
968,"when i walked by tuesday it was closed. there was something on the door that said ""massachusetts business license"". all the windows were covered with paper so you couldn't see inside. maybe they're doing renovations? 

[they are reopening today](http://harvardsq.felipestaqueria.com/)"
969,"that kind of surprises me; i guess it speaks to the fact that ""most politically active"" can mean a lot of things. from my own experience and the circles i ran in, i'd describe harvard as politically active, but with an emphasis on professional politics rather than activ*ism*. harvard culture seems a lot less ""social justice""-y to me than the stereotype of liberal arts colleges. some student activist movements do happen, and they tend to get more national attention than a similar movement would at a less famous school, but they're movements of specific student groups, about which the student body as a whole often has mixed or lukewarm feelings. that could just be me, though, since there are as many harvard experiences as there are students."
970,"remember when occupy harvard shut down the yard a few years ago? a bunch of students camped out in the yard for like 2 days, gave up, left one event tent with a table, but yard was on lockdown for like a month"
971,"i know this probably counts as expected, but the library. it has a seriously incredible collection. what it doesn't have it can get for you from ill pretty quickly or you can ask them to purchase it. one of the great services the library provides is [scan and deliver](https://library.harvard.edu/services-tools/scan-deliver), which delivers scanned book chapters or print journal articles directly to your email within 4 days for free. library also provides free subscriptions to the washington post, the financial times, and the wall street journal.

[free film screenings at the harvard film archive for students](https://library.harvard.edu/film/films.html) might also be interesting to you."
972,"free access to most museums around boston, and/or cheaper admission to other (more touristy) things. 

eg free: mfa, isabella stewart gardner museum, harvard museum of natural history (+guest). 
eg cheaper: (i think) aquarium, top of the hub tour, maybe other tours such as duck tour. if not gsas usually organizes cheap or free outings to these events (red sox game too)"
973,daddy harvard paying for things
974,"pretty sure harvard is the only reason i get matches, not even kidding"
975,"tagging on to this to add that the mfa student discount is kind of a joke. it’s $23 as opposed to the ga price of $25. so make sure to specify that you’re a harvard student and bring your id to get free admission.

i think what the poster i’m replying to is talking about is outings & innings, which provides free or discounted tickets to just about everything, from musicals and theatre performances, to, again, more touristy stuff. sign up for their email list once you have your harvard login!"
976,i went to harvard too long ago...
977,"as long as you can be sure that you wouldn't be sacrificing financial stability or your academic path for harvard, the experience of its environment is phenomenal. 

everyone there is unique. like, do you have that one cool friend with an interesting backstory or life experience? for example, maybe they grew up in a country with an unstable politcal environment you knew nothing about, or they're a professional diver on the weekend, maybe they created remarkable and tangible change for their community, were an elected official in their local government, ran their own nonprofit, are a published author/reasearcher, former model, or anything else that would make for an interesting story? 

harvard is full of those people. you can learn and grow so much from just existing and talking to others. 

when i realized that some of the schools i applied to weren't providing that kind of diverse and unique atmosphere i started panicking; i wanted to learn from a diverse community, not just the professors. thankfully vistitas was a great relief, everyone was so interesting and inspiring (and intimidating) that i felt excited. 

not to say that there aren't negative aspects of the harvard community, but the environment is without a doubt intellectually stimulating."
978,harvard gives fricking amazing financial aid
979,"the name really does open up a lot of doors (worldwide)...even if you personally don’t subscribe to the whole “title” thing, the rest of society does. it opens up your options later in life...which is kind of the point of going to college in the first place.

that being said, there are plenty of people who go to plenty of other colleges and have plenty of doors/opportunities open. i assume if you got into harvard you ware a hard working individual who will make it no matter where you go! "
980,"based on your post history, you seem like a stem kind of person. i'm also a stem kind of person -- a freshman planning on concentrating in math and cs. the math classes are great. the cs is great. as far as i can tell, you're not going to get a significantly different quality in education in any major stem field between mit and harvard -- they're both fantastic. that being said, my favorite class so far has been a history class i switched into semi-randomly after i realized i didn't have to take a language. the class was absolutely fantastic, the lectures were incredible, and i didn't realize it for the first month or so but it turns out the lecturer is a sitting member of indian parliament. that wasn't a big lecture course either -- 27 people, no lottery. you're going to get some level of a liberal arts education here no matter what you concentrate in, and if you don't just shrug it off as requirements, it can be incredible. "
981,this guy harvards. 
982,"in addition to harvard, i believe the other cambridge school is my main choice"
983,harvard and another cambridge school primarily 
984,i would really appreciate any advice as well! deciding between stanford and harvard for econ. i know im not losing out on academics. but stress culture and social atmosphere is pretty important. how would u describe it to be at harvard? 
985,"depends what kind of stem. harvard is generally better than mit in the sciences and math (aka liberal arts), but mit is better at cs and engineering."
986,"so side fact: the on-going lawsuit found higher acceptance rate for incoming students from rural area. 

&#x200b;

personally, i have one of my mentees who is from rural alabama, first gen college student. he was in your shoes and worried about not being able to fit in. he is now in his sophomore year and involved alot on campus and the student mentoring program as a mentor himself. you will be fine! read someone else's reddit post where someone said harvard has a niche for everyone and i can't agree more with it. 

&#x200b;

if you have specific questions, feel free to reach out. "
987,"i think harvard does a lot to ensure that everyone has a place here. like any institution, it isn’t perfect and neither are the students. however, you’ll need to take initiative to meet people and keep an open mind. i’ve met some unlikely friends since i’ve been here, and they are wonderful! "
988,"i felt pretty much the exact same way after i got in (first one to come from my hs in 10+ years, admissions file mentioned where i came from as “a place where we do little business”) and it really kicked in during opening days. but in the long run you end up gaining so much more from going to harvard than not, even if you feel entirely out of place sometimes. there’ll be people similar to you, you’ll just have to find them and finding out who your friends are and aren’t is basically the most important part of freshman year. congrats on your acceptance, a great adventure awaits "
989,"i can say what's right for you, but i can say that you'll find all kinds of people at harvard. yeah, there are some rich kids, but the majority of students are on some kind of financial aid and are from every corner of the country and world."
990,"i was in the same situation - i'd be lying if i said it never felt weird or i never felt out of place, but overall you can definitely find your people. there are lots of low income kids at harvard, even though it doesn't always feel that way. feel free to pm me if you want to talk more about it!"
991,"i agree with all the other comments so far. the myth that harvard is entirely made up of trust fund kids of overstated.  only a very small proportion of the students here act exclusive and cliquey.  there is a place for everyone at harvard regardless of your interests. there are such a ridiculous number of student groups on campus that it is impossible not to find people who share interests with you, which is far more important than whether they have the same pre-college background as you. "
992,"i agree. hard to be arrogant that you're at harvard (the single most notable accomplishment on 99% of admitted kids' 'resumes' to date) when the same applies to everyone with whom you interact.

plus, the vast majority of your harvard experience will be indistinguishable from that of the wealthiest, most well-connected kids'. they'll go to the same classes (in the same sweatpants), eat at the same dining halls, hang out in the same common rooms, study in the same libraries, etc. 

within a few weeks, you'll have a heck of a lot in common / to talk about, vis-à-vis shared experiences. "
993,harvard wants to know your location
994,"update on stewart: [suffered hip injury, has been released from hospital and is expected to make full recovery.](https://twitter.com/dakrandall/status/1063923917117681664?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw%7ctwcamp%5etweetembed%7ctwterm%5e1063923917117681664&ref_url=https%3a%2f%2fnesn.com%2f2018%2f11%2fharvard-vs-yale-crimsons-convincing-win-marred-by-tom-stewart-injury%2f)"
995,tom stewart is now basically harvard's version of rudy... but a quarterback... who was mvp of the game. legendary.
996,"i'm really glad. if looked like his spine might have been snapped or something. by the way his mother was sobbing as they took her across the student section-side endoze, i think she was thinking she'd never talk to her son again.

just imagine your son being harvard's quarterback. that's the proudest thing in the world. then suddenly, with one dirty hit, it can then into a parent's worst nightmare—the most proud athletic position in the world becoming the worst mistake of a man's short life. "
997,"one of the professors told me that part of the issue besides going thru airports is that harvard is such an international university so the perceived likelihood of someone catching the virus is considered higher than for americans generally. and then if they brought it back it could be easily spread within harvard and then if they got sick and were sent home to their families after that it could compound the spread.

a friend of mine who teaches at stanford law told me they've instructed all the profs across the university to take everything onto zoom.

another thing too is that the demographics of college age or (most) grad students is they're not likely to have a serious infection and may not even notice they have the virus. the real beneficiary of this policy is everyone else in the community"
998,"it just happened.

""dear members of the harvard community,

like all of you, i have been intently following reports of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) and considering the many ways in which its future course might alter my life and the lives of those closest to me. these past few weeks have been a powerful reminder of just how connected we are to one another—and how our choices today determine our options tomorrow.

 

fortunately, a group of extremely dedicated people has been working literally around the clock to respond to the challenges posed by covid-19. our teams are considering every contingency as they undertake their important work, and i write today to update you on major near-term changes that will limit exposure to the disease among members of our community:

 

we will begin transitioning to virtual instruction for graduate and undergraduate classes. our goal is to have this transition complete by monday, march 23, which is the first day of scheduled classes following spring recess.
 

students are asked not to return to campus after spring recess and to meet academic requirements remotely until further notice. students who need to remain on campus will also receive instruction remotely and must prepare for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions. all graduate students will transition to remote work wherever possible. schools will communicate more specific guidance and information, and we encourage everyone to review prior guidance about both international and domestic travel.
 

we are transitioning over the course of the next few days to non-essential gatherings of no more than 25 people. please note this is a change from prior guidance.
 

the decision to move to virtual instruction was not made lightly. the goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in close proximity with each other in spaces such as classrooms, dining halls, and residential buildings. our actions are consistent with the recommendations of leading health officials on how to limit the spread of covid-19 and are also consistent with similar decisions made by a number of our peer institutions. the campus will remain open, and operations will continue with appropriate measures to protect the health of the community.

 

for regular updates and additional information, please visit this dedicated webpage. provost alan garber, executive vice president katie lapp, and huhs executive director giang nguyen will continue to send you updates by email as needed. you will also continue to receive school- or unit-specific information from local leadership. if you are a student or faculty member and have specific questions or concerns, i encourage you to be in touch with the contacts identified by your dean. if you are an employee, i encourage you to be in touch with your manager.

 

despite our best efforts to bring the university’s resources to bear on this virus, we are still faced with uncertainty—and the considerable unease brought on by uncertainty. it will take time for researchers, a good many of them who are our colleagues, to understand enough about this disease to mount a reliable defense against it. now more than ever, we must do our utmost to protect those among us who are most vulnerable, whether physically or emotionally, and to treat one another with generosity and respect. please remember that harvard counseling and mental health services and the harvard employee assistance program are available to help you manage anxiety and stress. your mental health is just as important as your physical health.

 

to our students, i know it will be difficult to leave your friends and your classrooms. we are doing this not just to protect you but also to protect other members of our community who may be more vulnerable to this disease than you are.

 

to our faculty, i recognize that we are asking you midway through the semester to completely rethink how you teach. we do this because we know that you want to avoid putting your students at risk.

 

to our staff, i understand that we are expecting you to go above and beyond in your efforts to support our important mission of teaching and scholarship. we do this because we know we can rely on your creativity, flexibility, and judgment through these challenging times.

 

i am proud to be a member of a community where people put the greater good above their own self-interest. thank you for your patience and your resilience as we all learn to temper increased distance with deeper care for one another.

 

with appreciation,

larry

1000,"getting back in the country is not a university thing, i don't see how this shows harvard learning about you leaving"
1001,"so much of the future is based less on race (or whatever variable you want to use) and more and more on socioeconomic status as we shed our sometimes pajoritive and segrative definitions of each other. 

it is invetible if not already considered. a healthy collegiate population should include a mix of different: races, religions, cultures, genders, and geographic and economical backgrounds.  even then each of those aformentioned variables contain a plethora of iterations.

harvard, i hope, will continue to do well and be a leader in bringing the brightest youth together for the persuit of academic and social excellence and the preservation of what it means to be a positive contributor to this ever so complicated world."
1002,"that will never happen for multiple reasons. 

first, even if they wanted to, the sat gap between rich and poor students is twice as large as black and white students. to admit a large amount of low-income students would mean the school would have to lower their standards even more than they do for special interest groups they already preference. 

second, poor students are less likely to become future donors that the school can draw from for financial support. therefore, there's no incentive for them to do so. 

third, and most importantly, the whole point of going to harvard and similar schools is to surround yourself with the wealthy elite. low-income students benefit by meeting these kids, being brought into their circles, and forming life-long connections with them. 

kahlenberg's model would make harvard 50% economically disadvantaged. rich kids don't want to be surrounded by poor kids and they would just go elsewhere. that other college would become the \*new\* harvard. 

admitting large amounts of poor people, whatever their color, is of little benefit to harvard.  "
1003,"i'm a current junior at the college. personally, i've had mostly positive experiences with my classmates regardless of their racial or socioeconomic background. ultimately, i think harvard admits students who can (1) profit from the intellectual experience and (2) make valuable contributions to campus life. i think everyone's admission is meticulously calculated. "
1004,that won't ever happen. harvard is more of a social club than it is an academic meritocracy. 
1005,"the students are academically brilliant, but most kids are wealthy. a disproportionate amount are legacies or went to a prep school. the value of harvard is the institutional connections you make. let's be real, we all forget the things we learn in the classroom. 

joining a finals club has a bigger impact on your future than what you learned in a random humanities class. "
1006,"as the first in my family who attended university and a harvard graduate i’m really happy to tell you that you’re wrong and ignorant. 

i’ve been in the workforce for 20 years with people who studied at other “great” universities and most of them, and their experiences, pale in comparison. "
1007,props to the first person to create the reddit alien as the john harvard statue.
1008,"i should hope there are no jordan petersons at harvard!

anyway, raj chetty's got a lot of public work, and a course of his has lectures available online. michael sandel's justice is a famous example. greg nagy has online lectures too iirc."
1009,john rawls’s lectures on modern political philosophy are up on youtube! probably the most influential political philosopher of the 20th century and was considered to be one of the greatest harvard professors of all time! highly recommend
1010,melissa dell - just got an award for her economic research - pretty interesting stuff: [https://scholar.harvard.edu/dell/publications](https://scholar.harvard.edu/dell/publications)
1011,"noam elkies is definitely my candidate for harvard's current feynman, except he's a huge sweetheart instead of a huge asshole. [here's a fun and pretty accessible lecture/performance](https://youtu.be/gc7r7xmnmfe?t=289) he did on math and musical canons a few years ago—come for the ability to whistle two notes at once, stay for the introduction to topological treatments of music theory"
1012,"mine is from hds and is in latin. i just assume it's harvard being harvard ""because they can""."
1013,i usually write my entire resume in latin to match. that way the diploma won’t look odd. oddly enough i never hear back at my @harvardiana.edu inbox. hmmm
1014,"yep - i have an hbs diploma in english and an ma from gsas in latin.  and then an ab from the college, which is in english but uses the latin ab instead of ba just to be extra special i guess. 

i don’t know if any schools other than gsas use latin? 

also fwiw, the english mba diploma was from last year, so don’t think harvard as a whole has recently switched to latin as another person suggested."
1015,">harvard's hitting all my marks--integration w/ city, 3-year residential system, and openness about struggles between students.

these are very strong reasons to choose harvard that, imo, trump the strength of their cs department. i might be biased because i had to make a similar decision between stanford and mit. i declined stanford for the exact same reasons you've listed.

honestly, social factors will play into your mental health much more than than the delta in cs opportunities. harvard students sometimes pursue research assistantships at mit, so the gap is filled there.

do consider the weather, though. i actually like boston weather more than stanford (sue me) because i enjoy seasons and overcast ~*vibes*~."
1016,"what kind of cs are you into? whereas harvard's cs course selection is slim and leans more theoretical, stanford has that but also more ""fun"" cs classes like app development and startup classes.

in my experience, the most talented cs kids here end up in very high paying finance firms that give off an academic vibe. this is just conjecture, but i think the most talented stanford cs kids seem to be very entrepreneurial. you'll definitely find people interested in software development at finance firms at stanford and, vice versa, startups at harvard, but i think this broader difference is reflective of cultural differences at the two schools you might want to take into consideration."
1017,"> overly techy culture

well, you are studying cs ... ;) (boston/cambridge can be overly techy, too, if you stay in your bubble. every school has bubbles.)

i loved cambridge/boston while i was there; made a lot of friends outside of harvard from area schools such as the berklee school of music, mit, and bu.

however, i hated the weather. we have some nasty winters from time to time in ohio and i had a couple while i was in philly, too, but boston winters suck suck suck. (did i mention boston weather sucks?)

my two cents: stanford for its superior cs dept., the connections its dept. will give you, and the weather. might have answered differently had your other acceptance been mit, but imo, stanford>harvard for the reasons given.

edit: undergrad? harvard. lotsa choices of majors if you change your mind (most of us did), and there are a bajillion harvard-funded opportunities and clubs. and, as mentioned, the city-wide friends i made. the ""h-bomb"" always gets a reaction world-wide. stanford? not as much. (boston weather still sucks, though. ;))"
1018,"if you intend to go long tech with your career, stanford is the stronger school. harvard has a strong theoretical cs department, and its recent seas capital investment does show harvard’s commitment to the future, but its distance from sv (in addition to how behind the curve it currently is) has it so harvard’s cs is considerably behind stanford’s. interning/ working at the fangs are obviously accessible from either school (as would gs/ms/jpm on ws be accessible to stanford grads), but the deep integration of stanford’s faculty with industry allows its students to consider opportunities in ai/ software startups that are simply very hard to find from harvard. it’s also important to mention the significant component of elitism that’s interwoven into harvard’s culture, where the dominant role that hasty pudding, finals clubs, and their associated prep school alumni is fairly overwhelming.

there was a “cambridge or california” groupme last year that was extremely helpful for hypsm cross admits when we were making this decision last year; consider joining something similar. as a caveat, keep in mind that none of us have attended both h and s at the undergraduate level, and a lot of what we mention regarding the other school comes from a limited anecdotal pool. also, remind yourself that either schools are incredible, and congratulations on the options! feel free to pm!"
1019,"i guarantee you, 99% of your time will be on campus lol. all i'm saying is don't choose harvard because it's close to boston. 

i'd go with stanford, tbh. better cs department, sunshine (fuck new england weather), less toxic social life catered to wealthy, well-networked students. but what i do really like about harvard is the residential system. also, i wouldn't say harvard students are any more ""open"" than stanford students. in general, these sweeping generalizations don't really hold up. people vary everywhere. the duck syndrome exists at harvard too.

tough choice but i personally think stanford would be better for your interests."
1020,"was making a joke of course. but just ask in a general cs subreddit (should be plenty) and i’m willing to bet everyone there will also give you a lot of pros and cons. good luck. but remember this saying, “a lamborghini is a lamborghini, and harvard is harvard” meaning you really can’t go wrong with coming to harvard as your choice of school. that’s like saying you own a lamborghini. doesn’t matter what year it really is people are just impressed you have one. even if it’s a 2010 lamborghini. people are easily impressed when you say harvard it’s like a universal language saying “i’m amazing” in a sense if you of course understand my analogy. take care and good luck."
1021,"i have two pieces of advice.

* don't choose your school based solely on your intended major, especially if you think you might wash out.
* don't worry two much about being behind the curve. i took calculus and math 101 my freshman year at harvard. i never caught up to the geniuses, but i got a ba in math (cum laude and everything) that counts just as much.

(also, i didn't get accepted at mit, so choose harvard.)"
1022,"you can take any of the mit classes at harvard. i know many who take cs who substitute some of their classes with their mit equivalent, and a lot of the ""base level"" classes are fundamentally similar. therefore, this is more of a question of fit and what you want out of university life."
1023,go to harvard. you can always do mit for graduate school or a masters. you can cross register too.
1024,"depends what you are looking for i think harvard is better in terms of resources. from my friends at mit, you can go to mit events as a harvard student but for an mit student to go to a harvard event, it’s a little more difficult. who gave you the better financial aid package? what type of social life do you want? think of it that way instead of the “better” program because either school is going to be home for the next 4 years."
1025,"mit is very focused. if you have any other interests you want to explore, come to harvard"
1026,"harvard cs beyond the first year courses ends up being a lot of math, more of a focus on the theoretical than the applied."
1027,">from what i’ve heard, mit is very difficult and it may be hard for a newbie like me in the comp sci dept.

on average, they are of comparable difficulty. i switched from biological engineering to computer science at mit during my sophomore year. with no prior experience in programming, i'm graduating with a good gpa and a somewhat stable job (covid has introduced uncertainty). graduate school is definitely an option for me, in case that's your m.o. comparing notes with friends at harvard has led to the conclusion that the core cs curriculum is of similar difficulty. mit has notorious outliers that are amongst the toughest cs classes that exist, but they are not required to graduate, such as 6.172 performance engineering and other graduate-level electives.

while cross-registering is possible, note that the schedules of mit and harvard don't align. a non-trivial amount of logistical planning is necessary to cross-register in a non-intrusive way. altogether, i recommend you choose a school based on social fit and your financial situation."
1028,"as a senior, i would echo everyone else's comments that you should take into account other aspects of college. personally, although looking back harvard wasn't the best school for me among the options i had (i got interested in cs and ee during college, but i do not like seas here), i did not want to attend mit because i didn't identify with the overly geeky/nerdy culture, and i wanted more academic diversity in the student body. i also really like the house community here, and i think it makes for a much more enriching social experience. so all in all, socially, i think harvard trumps mit for my taste. but seeing as you're the type to apply and get into mit in the first place, maybe the mit community is just what you're looking for.

academically, to me the situation depends on how much you're invested in studying cs. i think no one would disagree that mit is a better school than harvard for cs. the cs department at harvard has really talented faculty doing great research, but i don't think they have their undergrad pedagogy really figured out. many of the courses are notoriously poorly taught, and the elective offerings are few and far between. additionally, the department is heavily bent toward cs theory at the expense of programming, and a lot of my friends and i have had to look toward other resources (projects, internships, online classes) to hone our programming skills. mit is great at both theory and the practical parts of cs, and they have elective offerings that span all areas of cs. (you'll never hear about mit students cross registering at harvard for a cs class --  why would they? lol)

like u/willing_breadfruit mentioned, i also think that a lot of the harvard cs classes are harder than the mit ones (but not better!). so i don't think it's necessarily true that by choosing harvard you're gonna have an easier time with your courses; quite the contrary in many cases. one major difference is that mit's majors have a higher number of course requirements than do harvard's. but harvard cs courses tend to pack a lot more material per class than mit, so overall, it probably evens out as far as the total work you have to do. but i think mit's more spaced out degree plans give you some more breathing room, as well as a chance to do well in more courses and give yourself more time for certain subjects by spacing them out across multiple semesters. but on the other hand, harvard is more generous with grades (people *rarely* ever straight up fail classes here, whereas at mit there's a non-trivial amount). additionally, because the cs degree here has fewer total requirements, you'll have more room in your schedule to take whatever elective courses you want outside of cs. 

you mention you're just leaning toward cs, so harvard could definitely be better for other interests, especially if you have interests in non-stem fields. you should let us know what your other interests are, and, as i said above, what social climates you think you might prefer. if you came here telling us that you wanted to focus solely on cs, and academics was the most important thing to you above everything else, i'd tell you to go to mit. so more information is needed here, imo.

p.s.: you don't need to be an awesome programmer to major in cs, anywhere! i didn't program before coming to college. but of course, i'd recommend you spend time getting better at it, as it'll only help you hit the ground running when you get to college.

**edit:** notice how everyone is saying ""you can always take cs courses at mit by cross registering"", as if there's an expected deficiency by doing cs at harvard that you'll need to make up for. cross-registering is obviously great, but it's not as easy as people make it out to be. the 2 schools don't share the same schedules, and the \~15 minute commute + time waiting for transportation can add up when you have a busy schedule, not to mention the fact that you'll need to go there multiple times a week for things beyond your lecture meetings, like section and office hours. not a huge deal, but something to consider. moreover, i personally hate the idea of having to go out of your way to supplement your courses. so all in all, i don't think cross registering is a perfect solution to make up for the difference between the two schools, but again, this only really matters if you want to really focus on academics."
1029,"if you're leaning towards stem, i'd wholly recommend mit. while harvard does have a strong pure maths department (harvard/mit interchangeably place first for the putnam every year), mit's strengths lie in its cs and engineering for undergrad, and its \*made\* to be accessible for ""newbies""! your first semester would be pass or no record, and your second would be a/b/c or no record, allowing you to ease into your college and social workload. 

the culture of mit is also extremely collaborative, and i'd generally advise against relying on cross-registering with mit should you choose harvard as its 1) logistically challenging (needing to subway back and forth – the t stops in kendall square instead of along mass ave., meaning its a significant walk to and from class, excluding how far you have to walk to harvard square from where you are on campus; the class schedules don't mesh well together) and 2) culturally unnecessary (as your cs friends at harvard would likely be taking cs-50 and p-setting together, and you shouldn't spend all your time on mit's campus). 

please feel free to pm! and congrats on the acceptances!"

1031,"i genuinely can't tell if i'm being accused of lying about my degree on the internet. i assure the world that i do have a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics from harvard college, even though harvard considers math to be a ""[science](https://advising.college.harvard.edu/concentrations)"". i probably won't ever abbreviate ""bachelor of arts"" as ab, even if harvard or some dude on the internet tells me to.

i also think my initial advise to this student was pretty good, and he's probably going to go to mit not because he has confirmed that harvard students/alums are a bunch of pedantic a-holes."
1032,the only sbs harvard gives out are in engineering. math at the undergrad level here is an ab degree. get your facts straight before you accuse someone of lying about their degree.
1033,"i said i received an a.b. the person i responded to said he had a b.a.  i included a link from harvard describing its undergrad degrees. i did not claim to be an expert on every concentration.

and go screw yourself."
1034,"writing ""*well, actually, harvard abbreviates 'bachelor of arts'  as ab*"" is almost the exact definition of pedantry. and passive/aggressively suggesting that i should know that math is a science, and science degrees are sbs at harvard is the a-hole part."
1035,shit. incoming grad student here. you harvard college people scare me...
1036,"hey! it’s an amazing place if you decide to attend. the university is huge and you really have a chance to meet people from all walks of life. 

the decision for your degree should never be made lightly...but harvard has become a home for me and i’m sure most students would agree that it’s a very supportive environment. 

best of luck with your decision and feel free to reach out if you want to chat."
1037,"environment: 

it was nice to meet people who spent a lot of money on school apparel to advertise where they attended. people were nice. i mostly hung out with the pot heads and party crowd. those are my kinds of people. people are just like any other college but i sensed we all shared a common goal, to be successful in what we do and to leverage the name to get us through closed doors.

my workforce experience:

here's what will help manage your post graduate expectations (i was a grad student there bc i wouldn't have been admitted as an undergraduate. i was a party animal with average grades and no volunteering or significant achievements).

i make the same amount of money as my fellow colleague who graduated michigan state university with an mba. i work in a tech role as a manager for cloud. 

when people at work hear you're an alum:
people start listening to you in the room when you speak when they know you're a harvard alum. but that romance only lasts for 1-2 minutes after introducing yourself. then everyone is like well you had better be the next best thing since slice bread or we will write you off smart guy.

so be humble because you will meet some people who are smarter than you. i will admit, at least in my opinion,  i only got in harvard because i filled a ”quota” and the timing was spot on and all the stars aligned. the universe had spoke to me and said...”this is your time now my child, go forth, and do not fck this up.”

in retrospect, it was a bit more expensive than it should've been for what i do. however the networking made up for that through higher offers which were facilitated by target companies (faang) feel like we should add microsoft in there too. 

working at big name companies versus a f500, well, i personally enjoy more established companies bc it feels more relaxed and less intense. i make relatively less money but i only work 40 hrs a week. that time vs money trade off was worth it for me. 

good luck in your studies, spend the next 4 yrs finding your personal brand and building a professional network on linkedin."
1038,"open facetime on your laptop and just stare at yourself for like, two hours. 

this will give you a 100% accurate picture of what harvard is like right now"
1039,"why can't harvard, with a 40b endowment, pay for flights home and storage costs? 

amherst has a 2b endowment and has managed to do this. the college has even said they will prorate and refund room and board charges.

they are also allowing some students to stay on campus."
1040,"harvard is paying for flights home for students on financial aid. harvard is also planning to prorate room and board/refund the amount that covers the remainder of the semester. harvard is also allowing some students to stay on campus if they have a good reason/petition the administration. christ, did you even do any research before writing this?"
1041,"amherst has managed it. granted, it's a much smaller school. but i guarantee harvard could hire contractors and get it done.

maybe nobody knows how to do project management and logistics there?"
1042,"there are always tourists on harvard campuses, especially the main undergraduate one."
1043,my son attends harvard and some of the students told us that tourists will walk right up and look in the bottom floor dorm windows.
1044,they open the doors to classes while they're in session to take pictures. the harvard brand and the harvard education are sometimes at odds.
1045,"they want to know what harvard dorms are like.  which is valid.  i don't remember if i got to see one on my tour, but it certainly wouldn't have prepared me for canaday!  i wonder if it's any different now; it's been a while."
1046,"1. harvard is far more political now than it used to be. harvard wants to admit students who will ""change the world"" in the way that harvard wants to see the world changed.  for example, gun control advocate david hogg got in because he is a media darling even though his stats are shitty.  your dad probably thinks you do not fit this profile.
2. in 1982, the dean of harvard admissions made a policy that 10 percent of admitted students should be geniuses in their intended academic specialties. these are people who win isef or national math competitions.  your father thinks you probably do not fit this profile.
3. harvard actively pursues minority students who are good students but who do not fit category 2 above.  your father probably thinks you do not fit this category."
1047,"don’t take it in any way. his times were different, yours have changed now. we can’t compare it. and nonetheless, wherever you go as long as you aspire to become a good person who cares about our community, you’ll do well and it honestly doesn’t matter. ten years down the line people will look at the person you’ve become they won’t care about where you got your education from. yeah sure harvard carries a large prestige but don’t break your head over it. dartmouth is also good in its own way. just do your best, forget everything else. parents tend to become touchy about topics like this, but don’t think about it man, you’ll do good. cheers! "
1048,"hey man dartmouth is still good shit! my girlfriend just interviewed for their grad school, they say they “have a hard time turning away the children of dartmouth alum”. so she keeps telling me if our kids can’t get into harvard, dartmouth is a pretty good backup 👍🏼"
1049,"harvard has always dealt in two currencies: money and prestige.  harvard accepts students that will bring them prestige if they provide money, and students who will bring them money if they provide prestige.  actually talented people or e.g. david hogg fit the former profile.  someone who has a building named after their grandfather fits the second."
1050,"“the dramatic increase in selectivity that we’ve experienced makes the admissions process more competitive for everyone, but our legacy applicants are admitted at a rate that’s roughly two-and-a-half times greater than the overall rate of admission. it’s never easy to turn away the children of dartmouth alumni.”

universities provide a wonderful chance for connection with people around you, sharing common interests and drive. this all changes after you graduate, and the experience can be incredibly cold and isolating. but sometimes people slip through the cracks of the university system and experience this earlier.

1072,"this is a quote from [the harvard crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/15/harvard-coronavirus-cares-act/)

""experts say that harvard will likely continue to face “grave” financial consequences as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.

university administrators announced salary and hiring freezes, discretionary spending reductions, leadership salary cuts, and the potential deferral of capital projects in an email to harvard affiliates monday.

the university will also sell $1.1 billion in bonds, according to a report last week from moody’s investors service.

its flagship faculty, the faculty of arts and sciences, has already netted $30 million in expenses and lost revenue due to the pandemic, leaving it unable to cover its yearly budget, fas dean claudine gay announced last week.""

it appears the pandemic has also halted their revenue, which means they have been burning through all of their non-tied up reserve money."
1073,"here is a quote pulled of the google search for the harvard crimson in case you wonder about their conflict of interest.

""the harvard crimson, the daily student newspaper of harvard university, was founded in 1873. it is the only daily newspaper in cambridge, massachusetts, and is run entirely by harvard college undergraduates. the newspaper is operated by the trustees of the harvard crimson, a nonprofit organization."""
1074,it was literally the first sentence of an official harvard press release
1075,"once the funds are disbursed they're not part of the endowment anymore, though. i understand that the endowment funds those things, but it literally *is* just a collection of cash and financial assets. a lot of the endowment is restricted in how it needs to be spent, but the incentive is to spend as little as possible because the gains belong to the general fund which is discretionary spending.

for example, as of 2018-2019, harvard's net assets are $49.3 billion, of which the endowment is about $39.2 billion. so most of harvard's value is tied up in that mountain of financial instruments, with about $10 billion being the net assets of everything else. if harvard were to disburse $3 billion of its endowment, then the endowment would have $36 billion and the net assets would remain unchanged.

a lot of people think ""endowment"" means ""all of a university's assets"" and posts like op's contribute to that. people who are proposing different tax treatments or uses for endowments aren't suggesting universities sell their hard assets or human capital. in fact, most of those proposals are trying to get universities to hoard less and convert more endowment into ex-endowment assets."
1076,"why would you trust a harvard press release to tell the truth about their corruption? why would you ignore evidence and logic? you've been offered multiple sources showing that harvard received money from epstein, and that their president had a personal relationship with him, and that their chair of chemistry and biology was aiding china."
1077,"yeah very threatening, they're getting revenge on epstein by getting the president to ask harvard nicely for money back. you're a joke. you think the president making vague unbacked threats is the same as a fullscale legal suit on completely different case."
1078,"no because that’s preposterous. any corrupt harvard officials are dealt with, you are a conspiracy theorist. please stop wasting time and sue! i’ve finished all of netflix already and would like to see something as entertaining as a conspiracy theorist losing a lawsuit."
1079,"are you a parrot? everytime i ask you for substantial proof of one extreme conclusion you made, you point to another completely irrelevant source. we were talking about harvard’s sba allegations and then you point back to a completely unrelated case? what does one insignificant guy who did work for china have to do with harvard? the only one who profited was that one guy, not harvard. news flash: this world is impure and many organizations and corporations will all have a few bad apples, what matters is how they’re dealt with, and this guy was dealt with.

even your own source had the department if justice claim that harvard had no idea! ffs! “... unbeknownst to harvard”"
1080,"sophomores are guaranteed n-1 housing (or possibly better). for your group of 6, this would mean 5 rooms. a room is counted as either a bedroom or a common room. it would be unlikely to get a suite with 4 bedrooms and one common room because there are very few rooms like this in eliot house. all suites have one bathroom.

more likely, you’ll get two suites next to/near each other. at its worst, this would be one room that has a bedroom and a common room and another room with two bedrooms and a common room. often, people convert these common rooms into singles. they are likely walkthrough singles, but not necessarily (bc eliot had weird architecture). at best if you are lucky, you could get two suites with 3 rooms each that each have two bedrooms and one common room.

in the housing lottery, generally seniors pick first and then juniors. the rooms that are left are given to the sophomores. the way that eliot structures the lottery leaves lots of 3 room suites left and odds and ends that weren’t picked up by the upperclassmen and a handful of rooms reserved for sophomores. 

you guys could go into the lottery as 6. you could also consider going in as 2 groups of 3. the two groups of three have no guarantee of being near each other, but you can note a preference to be near another group on the housing form. because i said there are more 3 room suites left over at the end of the lottery, you might (no guarantee) have better odds of each getting the three room suites with this move. you could also run the risk of each getting two room suites. it’s sort of the high risk, high reward option imo.

these are the floor plans of eliot. https://eliot.harvard.edu/floorplans"
1081,"there is only one unit in mather without singles. it’s the apartment on cowperthwaite. you get doubles, but also a whole apartment with a private entrance. 

the tower is made of 5 bedroom suites with no common space, but massive singles. the low rise ranges from 3-6 person suites. all singles with common rooms and a shared bathroom with one other suite. 

when i got placed in mather i was disappointed because i wanted a typical, old school harvard house. in hindsight, it was the best thing that happened to me while at harvard (apart from meeting my future wife). my roommates and i were on hoco and are featured in a number of the housing day videos from the late 2000s and early 2010s. fun fact: mather began the housing day video trend back in 2006 or 2007. my personal favorites are concrete seduction and my house."
1082,">  though the statute is decades old, the department only recently began to vigorously enforce it.

>while the department said it has found foreign money generally flows to the country’s richest universities, “such money apparently does not reduce or otherwise offset american students’ tuition costs,” the document said.

so, in an election year, they're going to selectively enforce a statute that hasn't been used in years to attack institutions trump's based doesn't like. and while they do it, they talk about tuition costs which are irrelevant and, not mention are $0 at harvard if your family makes $60k or less. and the department that's doing it is headed by a completely unqualified trump loyalist.

this has nothing to do with national security and everything to do with ""giving it to those educated, coastal elites!""."

education department investigating harvard, yale over foreign funding
officials accuse schools across u.s. of soliciting funds from foreign governments, companies known to be hostile to the country

harvard university is one of the schools being investigated by the education department over its disclosure of foreign funding.

the education department opened investigations into harvard and yale as part of a continuing review that has found u.s. universities failed to report at least $6.5 billion in foreign funding from countries such as china and saudi arabia, according to department materials viewed by the wall street journal.

the investigations into the ivy league schools are the latest in a clash between u.s. universities and a coalition of federal officials including law enforcement, research funders such as the national institutes of health and defense and energy departments, and a bipartisan group in congress that has raised concerns about the reliance of higher-education institutions on foreign money, particularly from china.

a harvard spokesman said the university is working on a response. a yale spokeswoman didn’t immediately have a comment.

the education department described higher-education institutions in the u.s., in a document viewed by the journal, as “multi-billion dollar, multi-national enterprises using opaque foundations, foreign campuses, and other sophisticated legal structures to generate revenue.”

officials accused schools of actively soliciting money from foreign governments, companies and nationals known to be hostile to the u.s. and potentially in search of opportunities to steal research and “spread propaganda benefitting foreign governments,” according to the document.

in addition, while the department said it has found foreign money generally flows to the country’s richest universities, “such money apparently does not reduce or otherwise offset american students’ tuition costs,” the document said.

u.s. officials say china uses a variety of means to target academia, including government-funded talent recruitment programs such as the thousand talents plan. the arrest last month of the chairman of harvard’s chemistry department on federal charges of lying about receiving millions of dollars in chinese funding through the program while the u.s. shelled out more than $15 million to fund his research group catapulted the issue into the spotlight.

in a letter to harvard dated feb. 11 and posted on the education department website, officials cited the recent justice department case and asked the school to disclose records of gifts or contracts involving the governments of china, qatar, russia, saudi arabia and iran. it also requested records regarding telecommunications giants huawei technologies co. and zte corp. of china; the kaspersky lab and skolkovo foundation of russia; and the alavi foundation of iran, among others.

the education department said yale had failed to disclose at least $375 million in foreign funding after filing no reports from 2014-17, according to a document viewed by the journal. the department, in a feb. 11 letter to the university, sought records regarding contributions from saudi arabia, china and its telecom giants, peking university’s yenching academy, the national university of singapore, qatar and others. it also asked the university to detail foreign funding of yale law school’s paul tsai china center and the new yale jackson school of global affairs.

if the schools refuse to disclose the information, the education department can refer the matter to the justice department, which could pursue civil or criminal actions.

1084,"if your family makes $60k or less, you pay zero tuition; harvard covers the full amount."
1085,"imagine both paths, and think what life would be like in the worst case scenario for both. would you wonder what life could have been like if you took the other option? then imagine both paths, and think about what you would feel if both went as well as possible. would you still wonder about one more than the other?

i think the one that you would always wonder about (and/or long for in times of frustration) should guide your decision. 

this thinking is what made me risk my situation by coming to harvard versus having a full-ride and fellowship, housing, and other benefits fully paid for at my state school. i thought that i would always wonder what my life could have been if i took a chance to go to a school across the country.

good luck, op!"
1086,"do acting! your early twenties is the perfect time to take risks. you don’t have kids, a house, or other obligations so this may be the only chance you get to pursue your dreams. a harvard degree is the best safety net you can get. you can always do finance later in life, but you can’t say the same for acting."
1087,"op, ask yourself this: what's going to wake you up in the morning excited to start your day? what do you genuinely like to do in your spare time, independent of prestige and the influence of your family and friends? what makes you happy --- really, truly, madly, deeply? i would advise you to engage in some introspection and reflect on your answers.

and don't worry about not having attended a top arts program like julliard, yale, or tisch. you went to harvard, and that's a highly commendable achievement in itself. you should be proud of your background. at the end of the day, it's about your raw talent and what you can offer the world. also, natalie portman went to harvard and she's an oscar winner, so i'd say you're following in the right footsteps.

i know it's not always easy to make it as an actor in the modern world. yes, it might be competitive, but someone has already taken note of your talent and offered you a role. and you know that you love acting. that's where your dreams lie! chase them. 

definitely pm me if you want to chat! i'd love to talk this decision over with you. i know how hard it can be, but i've got your back."
1088,"same, same, same. i just knew that question of what could have been would follow me forever if i had turned harvard down (cause who does that?). 

but the issue of worst case scenario is an important one here. because the worst case scenario of a high paying bank job might just be hating life, but the worst case scenario of acting could be never finding work again and living as a waiter out of the back of a car for the rest of your days while you chase your ""dream"". but even then, if that's what you would want over the bank job, go with that!"
1089,ask someone to define “safe job” when they’re a couple years out of college without substantial office experience and no harvard recruiting support.
1090,"thanks for your comment.

i’m just about to join the fall cohort of tie students and appreciate your viewpoints. my particular reason for doing the course is using as a springboard for a career change from the classroom to media/tech. i probably fit the bill for what you described many of your classmates wanting to do when they left.

knowing that it’s going to be such a short stint and the fact that i’ll miss the j term (heading back to new zealand for a wedding) i’m starting to feel the crunch to maximise my networking already. i’m already pesting as many people as i can on linkedin and making the most of the harvard email account. my worry is that i’ll be so frantic with networking and leveraging the course with contacts in the next 9 months that i won’t be able to actually enjoy the learning. did you find this to be the case among your classmates?"
1091,have you seen [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/harvard/comments/cgxhgw/the_harvard_professor_and_the_paternity_trap_this/)?
1092,"the tough thing about reviewing undergraduate programs is that only a tiny fraction of students have ever attended more than one school, meaning almost everyone has nothing to compare their school to. yeah, there’s some elitism, obnoxiousness, etc at harvard, but can we really expect a group of 6,000 of the world’s most accomplished 18-year olds would be any different?

visit the schools you’re interested in. read into the majors and classes they offer. those are *helpful* things to consider when picking a school - you will drive yourself crazy trying to aggregate and compare all the different generalist reviews of different colleges."
1093,"current freshman here. i’m loving it. i’m the kind of person who really likes to get lost in my work, and harvard has supplied a superb set of classes for me to take, great resources to help me succeed, and fantastic classmates who collaborate well. i’ve never seen overt elitism or cutthroat behavior, though tbf i’m not fantastic with social cues so i might be the wrong person to ask, but everyone i know is at least friendly, and most are kind, supportive, and intellectually stimulating. my experiences are limited to math/cs classes and a couple gen eds and the people i know are mostly the people who take those classes and those on my sport team, but i’d bet most of the student body is the same. come here, it’s great. "
1094,"100% would go again! my class was great. a very diverse group. life long friends. countless hours chatting and working together on psets at the dining halls. i would say the atmosphere is not really competitive, but there is a sort of a collective stress. it is harvard after all so the assignments will be challenging. also, harvard has unparalleled research, internship, and study abroad opportunities, things to take advantage of of you go there! good luck with your decision!"
1095,"just like yelp reviews, the negativity is often the result of a vocal minority. harvard’s dope. i’m super happy here and would rather be in cambridge than anywhere else."
1096,"i’m a grad student who has spent time in six different universities in three different countries. harvard undergraduates really are clever. they make things very interesting. this is a place where you can really learn and have amazing conversations.

as for people being competitive, i’ve seen worse in less prestigious schools precisely because they knew the school lacked said prestige and were scared of what that would mean once they graduated."
1097,"i’ve loved my experience at harvard. it would gave been a huge mistake for me to go to any other school. the opportunities at the college granted by the amazing staff, students, and resources is unparalleled. 

i have trouble imagining that i would be any less stressed at another university or would run into fewer obnoxious people. but i am positive i would have had fewer incredible experiences and met fewer amazing people. 

ultimately, it’s what you make it. my roommates are smoking weed on a tuesday night right now. doesn’t sound that stressful and awful to me. i’m watching a great new serious on netflix. today i toured a chocolate factory for class and then read on the new 10th story lounge couches overlooking campus.

for those having a bad experience at harvard, i would say 80% of the blame is a personal problem and they should seek help to fix it. the negative things you hear from people are a reflection of their approach to the school, not the opportunities given to them. "
1098,"harvard has the only undergraduate manchu-language course in north america, taught by one of the world’s foremost manchu studies and qing dynasty experts, mark c. elliot, mark schwartz professor of chinese and inner asian history. it was once an official language of china, but now has a few dozen native speakers."
1099,"grad student here. while there are many concerns as you have pointed out, there are certain aspects in which harvard exceeded my expectations and did a whole lot better than my undergrad. specifically, if financial barrier is stopping you from something, they will try their best to make sure that you can overcome that barrier. for my case, i had some medical costs that were not covered by the insurance and i was worried whether i should get the proper medical care i need. i cold emailed the financial aid office and they were actually able to figure something out so that i get the medical care i deserve. "
1100,"former transfer student here. i did my freshman year at georgetown and the rest at harvard. both great schools, but i’ll focus on my experience at harvard here. full disclosure: i was class of 2015, but i don’t have any data points to suggest it’s changed that much.

harvard was the most nurturing intellectual environment i have been a part of, and it has to do with the people as much as the resources. the resources point cannot be understated though—within a 15-minute walking radius you basically have some of the best experts in any field you can imagine, and that translates into great dinner conversations and extremely abundant opportunities if you’re willing to put in even a minimum amount of effort. the school is simply overflowing with opportunities (scholarly or otherwise).

is it competitive? yes, but not not in a cut-throat way. you simply have quite a number of capable and deserving people applying for the same positions/fellowships etc.—but the saving grace is that there are so many of those anyway. 

i guess there are pockets within the huge student body that can translate into bad experiences for some, but i found it very easy to avoid those. just to anticipate a concern op might have, apart from my walks back to eliot, the existence of final clubs did not even cross my mind for the most part for instance. 

also, keep in mind that oversharing about how great harvard is is heavily socially/morally discouraged (especially online) while sharing bad experiences is arguably rewarded, so you’ll get quite a biased sample online. i think the particular moment in history we’re going through (anti-elitist etc.) further exacerbates that.

to sum up, i really don’t think there’s anything worse about harvard than any other place of comparable caliber, and there are some very serious advantages. most importantly, you’ll get a very high concentration of great people that you’ll be happy to have met. feel free to reach out with questions."
1101,"just to parallel on this, i too am half way through my alm and there are professors who start class by saying how “ridiculously excited they are to have us in the classroom” and sent an email about a homework mistake with “we hope you know that we’re always on your side.  if err, we always give our students the benefit of the doubt.” as the closing line.

i did my undergrad at a large state school and started my pharm d at a smaller private school in nj and let me tell you no one has ever been so welcoming and encouraging as my harvard professors! under similar circumstances at the other schools the response would be to screw off. they want you to succeed and learn here at harvard; they are the best of the best and humble about it too boot. i highly recommend harvard to anyone who has the chance to go! you won’t regret it!"
1102,"i'm not a psychopath and have worked in finance since i graduated from the college in 2000. 

i can't speak to consulting, but finance, as a field, is incredibly broad and can be intellectually fulfilling as well as financially sound. to suggest just because you don't happen to know anyone - anecdotally i might add - who stayed in finance without a mental disorder is evidence of it a field not worthy of consideration is ignorant and stereotypical, at best. 

i would also state that in the higher rungs of finance (hedge fund or private equity, i happen to work at the former) there is a strong tendency towards incredibly smart, hard-working people. in other words, not necessarily pychopaths, but the same personality traits that brought us all to harvard in the first place.

1108,i feel like what you’re saying should be taken as a warning and not a reassurance. like sometimes harvard blows so bad that you literally feel the need to turn to institutional resources to “fix” things like not enough socialization. having friends should be simpler than that 
1109,"the first thing to recognize is that harvard is a private institution that receives federal money - this complicates things somewhat with regards to laws the school must follow. (for example, harvard still must prohibit possession of cannabis on campus even though it’s legal in massachusetts because it is still illegal federally)


with that being said, i’m really against the university’s actions against the clubs. i was never a member and never attended a party, so i don’t have any real ties to the clubs, but i can’t understand exactly what harvard’s grievance is against them. if you’re worried about sexual assault that’s one thing, but in the past few years it seems that the fight against the clubs has moved away from that aspect. you have male clubs and female clubs - is there inequality between them due to practical constraints (ie the cost of real estate for a house)? absolutely, but i certainly don’t think the solution to this inequality is banning or throttling club membership.


i think harvard will probably win any lawsuits on this front, but i don’t think it’ll win harvard anything tangible. i believe the real problem the school has with the clubs is that they’re a relic of a time harvard would rather forget: when harvard itself was explicitly an exclusive club for the wealthy, white men of the country. "
1110,"i was in dg as an undergrad and it was a huge benefit to my time at harvard. i was very sad to see the chapter close. 

i personally am opposed to the policy. punishing sororities because they don’t like finals clubs? crude analogy, but it’s like punishing the rapist and the rape victim. my sorority experience was about creating a safe, women-positive place entirely separate from final club culture. 

the idea that there is no place for single-gender spaces on a progressive campus seems misguided. "
1111,"it's already been stated several times that harvard is a private institution that accepts public funding. i also think harvard will win out regarding the lawsuit, but nothing will change except that some organizations might be driven a bit more underground. 

my opinion is that single gender clubs in general aren't going anywhere (except, notably, some of the female clubs that have already folded, which i would bet was not harvard's intent). 

moreover, they shouldn't. it is pleasant and enlightening to associate with a diverse crowd of people, but it is also pleasurable to meet up and enjoy time alone with people like you. this is why such groups as the armenian student association, the australian undergraduate society, and the black pre-law association exist on campus, to name a few. these are all very narrow-membership groups formed to associate with a specific group of people who all share something in common. to discriminate against any limited-membership group on the basis of the entire point of the group seems to fly in the face of what the university aims to accomplish in the name of diversity."
1112,"to your first thought: it's not that they aren't endorsing you for those positions, they are outright blocking you. it is no different than someone not getting a promotion in a company for their race, gender, etc.

also, the entire thing is a blatant title ix lawsuit.

can't be in a fraternity or sorority but wouldn't be punished for starting up an undergrad kkk chapter near campus. seems like harvard law is producing less intelligent graduates every year. "
1113,"> a good defense would be that students technically do still have the freedom to associate. they just don't have the college's institutional backing.

i don't think that argument really holds, because what's happening is that the university is penalizing people who choose to join these groups.  harvard is treating single-gender group membership as *punishable*.  it's not saying that the group is unaffiliated with the institution; it's saying that belonging to the group is a behavior problem.  i think the line between public and private is being violated on a *personal* level when the university decides that membership in some groups is punishable."
1114,i believe this law suit is unconnected to the admissions law suit. it was considered as soon as harvard instituted the new rules. 
1115,"harvard is still an exclusive club for the rich except now they can have super genius' who do nothing but study all day and have no time for thought too. wow, look at the diversity of free minds and character building going on at the university."
1116,">finally, despite the successful use of expanding tomato basil ravioli soup availability as a undergraduate council presidential campaign issue, the best harvard university dining services food is clam chowder.

hottest take in the entire column."
1117,">a corollary: downsize athletics. harvard has more division i sports programs than any other american college, and when these programs recruit, they take seats from non-athletes with better qualifications otherwise. (if this weren’t the case, we wouldn’t need to recruit them!) we should first cut the programs that most stack the deck for prep school kids (sailing, skiing, crew) and the ones that oft-injure their players (football).

i agree with football. it's objectively harmful. i was devastated by what happened last year. 

as for sports with high barriers to entry like sailing, skiing, and crew, i don't believe harvard should simply abolish those because they skew high income. yes, i acknowledge that classism in athletics is problematic, but that doesn't mean we should ban or ignore certain sports outright. i think sports are still valuable extracurricular outlets/activities. i know a lot of girls who are great athletes and super passionate about rowing. "
1118,"hey trevor! here's my super respectful challenge to your comments.

>we should adopt stanford’s “open-door policy” for alcohol. it’s absurd to think that banning alcohol from the yard will stop freshmen from drinking rather than making their habits more irregular and dangerous.

i would say i'm generally in support to promote safer drinking practices, but i will have to look at the data and rationale behind the policy before i make a conclusion. i will ask my psychopharmacology professor what he thinks and get back to you. overall, however, we still need better drug & alcohol education to dissuade students from making poor decisions in the first place. i feel like that's an important first step. i'm a psych major, so i have familiarity with the psychopharmacology of alcohol and other drugs. from a strictly health perspective, it's better not to drink because alcohol has little to no nutritional value as well as profound disinhibiting effects.  

>harvard should abolish general education and foreign language requirements. they mostly serve to add headaches and complexity to the process of choosing classes, which should be driven by actual intellectual interests or practical concerns.

do you think we should be more like brown with the open curriculum?

i respectfully disagree. personally, i love the gened program. in fact, i'm now a psychology concentrator because of the whole system that forced me to explore courses outside my areas of interest. i also just took my very first philosophy course this semester to fulfill my er requirement, and i'm honestly surprised by how much i love the discipline. i'm that kind of person who thought philosophy was a waste of time before taking a course in the field. i think a lot of students either take the wrong courses (stuff that's not compelling or memorable) or choose classes for the wrong reasons (e.g., they're gems, it's an easy a, no work, etc.). especially with the expansion of the gened program to accommodate more courses, you can still take classes in a broad range of disciplines that still align with your personal interests. you can take the classes you want to take while pushing your intellectual boundaries.

>relatedly, as psychology professor steven a. pinker wrote in a 2014 article in the new republic, harvard should refocus admissions away from extracurriculars and intangibles and toward academic potential, mostly measured by test scores and grades (even if i would not have gotten in under this regime).

do you want harvard to resemble caltech, whose admissions system is based on this approach? i'm just curious!

personally, i like harvard's admissions policy just the way it is. we still have very high academic standards in the admissions office. however, harvard also searches for passion and diversity of interest to create the most amazing school possible. we have such a vibrant student and extracurricular life because that's what harvard wants. harvard wants to train diverse leaders for a diverse society. we're all about academics and extracurricular excellence. i think we'd lose such a part of the culture if we solely focused on academics in admissions. this school has so much personality."
1119,">like nearly every other school, harvard should let students at least rank their housing preferences. some people want to be in the quad, and many don’t. mather house should house people who prioritize singles over classical architecture and proximity to the yard, and vice versa for adams house.

are you worried about the potential for self-segregation? will house diversity wane? do you think the houses will acquire certain reputations and characteristics (e.g., the sports house, the black house, the math house)? do you think members of the final clubs will try to segregate themselves to one house to be in greater proximity to their clubspaces, or even just to each other? these are critical question to ask.

i definitely think harvard should have more intimate housing options à la the co-op."
1120,"thanks for what is indeed a very respectful reply!
1) alcohol definitely has dangers, but i have two responses. first, the optimal amount of drinking is not zero, because people enjoy it, so it has benefits as well as costs. we should be focused on targeting drinking for which the costs outweigh the benefits, i.e., drinking to excess and avoiding medical help. in my own experience that has been echoed by many people i've talked to, banning alcohol meant that when i did get alcohol i would try to capitalize on that limited access as much as possible. make it less special!
second, banning alcohol does not necessarily lead to less binge drinking. see actual prohibition.
2) i had brown in mind, yes. i suppose i have more faith in the ability of fellow harvard undergraduates to choose their own courses: people continue exploring new disciplines long after their gen eds are satisfied, for example. and i think abolishing gen eds would lead to a reduction in easy a's and gems! those are overwhelmingly concentrated in gen ed programs. though i do think non-gen-ed gems exist for precisely the goal that you seem to have: getting students to take classes outside their concentration, exploring in low-stakes environments.
3) i think harvard would still be markedly different than caltech, just as harvard's graduate student body—which is admitted on very similar admissions criteria to the ones pinker and i are proposing—is different from caltech's. as pinker argues, admitting the highest academic achievers  would mean getting a whole lot of passion and diversity of interest! nerds are not boring. in fact, i'd argue that the people with the *least* passion and diversity of interest that i've met have been recruited athletes, the group whose numbers would most decline under my proposal.
i agree that we would lose a part of the culture, but i disagree that this culture is worth saving. it's a culture of filling up your resume with extracurriculars by vastly overcommitting and never specializing. one of the most common complaints about harvard culture that i've heard is exactly this pressure to find a dozen extracurricular engagements and continue them until you get leadership positions (see my previous column ""asking the right questions"")—which we've of course been trained to do, because that's how many of us got admitted in the first place. admitting a population that actually studies more and joins fewer clubs sounds like a healthier, more productive, and happier culture to me. (in my experience, cambridge and oxford had just this.)"

1127,"the disingenuous, status-driven social culture. don't get me wrong - i've made some really good friends here, and my blocking group is close-knit. but whenever i go to parties (especially to final club ones), i always notice that people's eyes are always roaming around, scanning the room for a more high status individual to talk to. a lot of people don't seem real, and they're always on the hunt to climb the social ladder. after a while, everyone in my eyes starts to become the ""look at me, i'm super smart but don't try that hard and go out every weekend and check out my instagram picture i took with all these other cool people and isn't my caption so witty omg"" type of person. it's honestly exhausting to me. idk if it's a harvard/ivy thing or just a general college thing."
1128,"the stress of schoolwork can easily, if not inevitably, prevent one from having a social life. this leads to students neglecting *by far* the greatest opportunity harvard provides: connecting with your classmates.

the people here are awesome. coursework can easily get in the way of establishing relationships with them. "
1129,"made a throwaway to reply to this. goddamn it's so fucking true. brief disclaimer: you can for sure find people here who are nice and genuine and sincere.
 
but there are a large number of people here, more than i've ever encountered in one place before, who (for lack of a better metaphor) lack **substance**. they are almost like ghosts - they seem real at first glance, you snap your fingers, and suddenly their transparency is evident. in true harvard fashion, these people are invariably friendly and will greet you whenever they see you, even though they would walk around you if you were bleeding out on the floor as so to avoid staining their shoes. but there isn't any way to hold the briefest of conversations with them. unless you are higher status than them, where higher status involves being invited to parties and having over 1000 instagram followers, they just don't want to know.

it feels like a large number of people here are compensating for the fact that they were unpopular in high school by attempting to metamorphose into some kind of party animal/raging asshole. i think i was just shocked by the shallowness of it all - that these people who were quite antisocial when they were younger and under their parents' thumb get into harvard, come here, and then decide to completely change everything about themselves in an attempt to create an image of some a-getting worry-less party gremlin to climb some pointless social ladder. it's just all so transparent, and like the guy above me said, it's goddamn fucking exhausting because of the constancy of it all."
1130,"also harvard thinks crimson is maroon, like ron's weasley sweater."
1131,"absolutely agree with this.

but try the med school fucks over in vandy hall. if you think undergrads are bad, these people are a whole other level of assholes.

most of these people where total dorks and weirdos. but now that they are in harvard medical school they have this fake swagger about them. 

also, the men in my program are the worst.

1132,"i think hds needs help more than any school at this point tbh. 

""as harvard’s most endowment-dependent school, hds has little in the way of funds not restricted to a specific purpose, such as faculty support or research. each year, the school must draw on scarce current-use funds for andover maintenance, a list of projects that grows as the building ages. every dollar used to patch antiquated electrical systems and plumbing is one that can’t be spent on the student experience or financial aid.""

1133,"i am so curious to hear more about hms as a harvard undergrad applying there for med school. these past few months, i've heard from a mix of current med students + classmates + professors that the social atmosphere can be...not great. like that's it's very clique-y and the administration can be quite aloof. several of my friends who got in chose to go elsewhere, partially due to financial aid but also because they felt like they didn't like the hms vibe. what are the main issues you see with your class?"
1134,"harvard college republicans were one of the first & few cr chapters that refused to endorse donald trump's candidacy. no further comment, just a fact.

intra-harvard issue-related politics? that's a different subject altogether, for sure. i've seen some nasty drama within the extension school."
1135,"dumb but serious question: do ""legacies"" also consider parents from non-undergrad? (ex: harvard graduate programs, etc)"
1136,legacy is obviously the correct fight to pick. this lawsuit is really an opportunistic proxy war against black and brown people who should rightfully receive the benefits of affirmative action. that being said legacy will probably be the policy harvard fights hardest to protect. 
1137,"most schools do. also, a point most articles miss is that harvard gets so many amazing applicants that there's a lot of luck involved. they could create a class 4x as big without lowering their standards at all.

once they've narrowed down to a set of applicants that are all qualified, then they start taking into account things like who plays the viola, who's a legacy, etc."

1142,"i honestly think the quality of online classes is a combination of the instructor's skillset - and, how students approach it. i am an alum now, and part of an organization that is still having incredibly rich training, community building, and collaboration online. but, i go into other spaces where participants have cameras off, don't speak up, aren't prepared, are multitasking. it's awful. i think the quality of students' experience will depend on the community and norms they build. i hope that harvard freshmen will rise to the occasion.

and of course - instructor skill with creating that collaborative environment is key as well. so shopping period, and really judging if the professor is ready to own the transition to online learning is essential."
1143,"hi op, rising senior here. i just completed my junior year online. i personally experienced a rather smooth transition to online learning, but i'm strongly considering taking time off if classes are online again.

there were definitely some aspects of online learning that i enjoyed. i certainly had more spare time to complete assignments, and i relished learning at my own pace. it was easier and more productive (in my opinion) to watch lecture recordings when i felt like it than to attend a bunch of lectures in person. all of the stressors that i experience on campus just went away, and i was able to direct 100% of my focus toward schoolwork. i'm not saying this was a completely positive thing, and obviously not everyone had the same experience. i know i'm very lucky to have a safe home and a supportive family. 

i strongly disagreed (and still disagree) with harvard's decision to impose mandatory sat/unsat grading on us. (i'll spare you my soliloquy but let's just say that people struggling this semester have gotten more sympathy and accommodations than anyone who has struggled with equally tough issues in semesters past.) i don't think that we'll have another sat/unsat semester in the fall because both students and faculty will have a lot more time to prepare for online learning, but if we do, i am definitely taking leave.

honestly i'm not 100% sure what i would do if i were you. compared to older students who may need to be on campus for research, recruiting, etc., you may not have as much to lose from an online semester. that said, half of the value of a harvard education is found in experiences that take place outside of the classroom. friendships, extracurriculars, networking -- those are things you can't necessarily replicate online. i'm not sure what you're looking to do on campus, but i know personally that none of my extracurriculars translate well to zoom. and screw all the curmudgeons commenting on crimson articles that ""spoiled harvard students"" need to suck it up and accept that the university doesn't revolve around us -- we and our families have sacrificed so much to attend harvard, and there's nothing spoiled or selfish about wanting to be able to take full advantage of its opportunities.

something additional that we both need to consider: if we were to take time off, would we be guaranteed a spot in spring 2020 or fall 2021? i don't think we know yet. unfortunately i can see harvard coming up with a system to disincentivize leaves. 

congratulations on your acceptance, and feel free to pm me with any questions."

if you want the full experience i suggest you take a gap year and use that to discover what you truly want in life and career because college goes by so fast. no one really cares if you graduated in 2024 or 2025 honestly. it won't hurt you job abilities graduating from a top school. people usually take a year off after college anyway before going to grad school so you won't be missing much."
1145,i doubt op has a 9-5 job they want to keep if they’re entering harvard college in the fall.
1146,"i've never thought of it that way. completely makes sense. assuming all of this is true, what would the waitlist numbers look like this year? i've been talking to a lot of admits, and many seem quite adamant in taking gap years if there is an online or hybrid semesters. by defer, i don't mean giving up the offer of admissions, but rather doing '25. if students did that, harvard would just fill those vacated spots with waitlisted people. this seems like the only logical reason why a school like princeton would go to waitlist this early when they didn't even use it last year.

 also, compounded with the incoming recession, wouldn't that also contribute to smaller enrollment across the board, and thus more waitlist movement. obviously, the recessions wouldn't have as large of an impact on the ends of the income brackets, in terms of ability to pay tuition, as much as it would for the average middle class working family. for low income admits, harvard would meet full need, as it is the richest school in the world, and recession or not, the very wealthy still have the means to pay for school. it is the middle class that have to make financial sacrifices due to partial aid that i see being most affected. do you think these admits could contribute to a situation causing lower enrollment? i had friends who were forced to turn down wharton and stanford due to financial problems last year, so it isn't out of the question for someone to elect not to take loans, and forgo harvard., especially given the current economic climate. any thoughts?"
1147,"wow i’m on the waitlist for ‘24 and that’s a bummer to hear. do you think that number will be lower than 65. also, why would princeton and stanford (i know someone who got off already) pull before may 1? if i’m not mistaken, stanford’s yield is slightly higher or at least the same as harvard. if stanford feels the need to admit off the waitlist this early, why wouldn’t harvard. and why would fewer people be admitted of the waitlist this year given what comparable schools have started to do?"
1148,"if harvard doesn't want people taking gap years, why are they moving back their gap year deadline until late june/ early july?  it only seems reasonable that, just like penn did when sending an email to int'l students, are open to people taking gap years.  historically, harvard has mentioned how transformative gap years can be, so i would imagine more people would take them this year, opening more spots for '24.  if anything, they will not accept many, if any, people for z-list and instead accept those admits directly into the class of '24.  i've also heard from some other sources that even people getting off waitlist may take a gap year, so it seems as if they will be taking more people this year, and the class of '25 admits will mostly be the more affected year b/c of that."
1149,go on instagram harvard2024
1150,"i’m really really hoping they do not force us to take classes pass/fail. i’m all for the students who need it being able to take courses pass/fail if they choose, but everyone else should not be forced to lose the grades they worked for this semester. 

in reality the percentage of students who can truly not complete the semester online is small, especially because harvard allowed many students from difficult backgrounds to stay on campus. petitions to switch to mandatory pass/fail claim it’s not fair to these students if the “privileged” students get to keep their grades. but i can’t imagine there’s a grad school or an employee that would judge you for your choice to take classes pass/fail during the pandemic."
1151,"that's fair, but i honestly think the only way to actually level the field is to have mandatory pass/fail. i would personally prefer opt-in pass/fail too because i'm pretty confident i can get an a in my classes, but your statement about grad schools/employees is a pretty big assumption. harvard med school, for example, said it wouldn't differentiate against pass/fail grades but only if the school made them universal to everyone."
1152,"that’s harvard med’s issue though. 

i just don’t think policy should be dictated by a truly small minority of students who don’t have internet, etc. instead i think the school should deal with those students on an ad hoc basis by allowing them accommodations, forcing their professors to accommodate them as necessary, etc. otherwise this is socialism at its worst lol."
1153,"straus is nice, with quick access to harvard square. one of the best features is the common room, which is this really cool old looking room with nice furniture and a huge tv. great spot to play a board game or something with friends. also has a small kitchenette in the back. the basement has a trash room and several music rooms but no laundry. the suites are nice and the bathrooms are large with two sinks each. the bedrooms are slightly smaller. the common rooms have ample space. overall, a great dorm. and pretty small so the community is strong. plus, it has a cute little courtyard in the front that it shares with matthews. great for a picnic or throwing a ball around."
1154,"harvard's best housing, without a doubt (along with ridgely, hampden, and fairfax)."
1155,"pretty nice. suites of 3 and 4 with ensuite bathrooms. rooms inside suites are pretty small tho. not much in the basement, but kitchen is available next door in mower. pretty close to harvard hall, pbha, and holden chapel. so, will be very convenient if you do public service or choir stuff."
1156,"yea, one year ago your a freshman in high school and now you “used” to live in a harvard dorm."
1157,"i broadly agree with the sentiment. i think the goal should certainly be to find justifiable ways of balancing the impact of the separation of wealth on admissions.

it is vitally important, however, that applicants be qualified. the college is intentionally difficult, and admitting students only to find them underwater in their classes will make no great societal advance. so i am cautious about the suggestion that harvard itself can solve the problems of public education. it is not the right entity to do so. but for well-qualified applicants, it seems obvious that there will be significant societal benefit to considering the challenges of socioeconomic context out of which an applicant nevertheless excelled.

of course, an applicant's high school record is fully visible to admissions officers, whereas her/his commercial prep services are currently not. i agree with your point that these services are likely to give the greatest advantage to those marginal applicants who can afford them -- if they indeed yield any advantage at all. in the worst case, these services are simply vultures."
1158,"yeah, i see what you mean. one of the strengths of the u.s. is that we have such an expansive system of higher education with multiple entry points - you don't need to attend harvard to succeed. and elite schools already do consider socioeconomic context and give bumps to kids from disadvantaged backgrounds.

it's just hard because being the child of lawyers and attending the best schools just gives kids such a massive leg up that it's hard to think about what the most elite schools can do to address these disparities in a meaningful and impactful way."
1159,"certainly. i can say that the socioeconomic level of my friend group from college is decidedly middle class -- and almost exclusively the children of well-educated parents, except in perhaps one or two cases. i think this is a highly vertical problem, with defects at all levels of the educational and economic system. 

what i expect harvard can do -- as you've intimated -- is simply to reverse its tendency to admit wealthy students of low qualification. i'm sure the alumni funds enjoy that aspect of admissions, but society at large does not benefit from reinforcing the high privilege of the highly privileged."
1160,i've always wondered how much of a pull legacy kids get at harvard relative to other schools. i almost thought that harvard has so much clout and financial resources that they don't need to consider legacy as strongly as some other institutions. plus it's not really all that surprising that incredibly intelligent and highly successful people marry each other (homogany) and in turn raise incredibly intelligent and highly successful children who have the best educational resources at their disposal - the type of kids who are primed to be admitted to a top institution regardless of whether their parents are alumni.

1163,"first of all, congratulations!!!

second, please don’t be discouraged by what you have read or heard so far. i graduated from harvard this past may and spent the next few months wishing i could go back and live over my time there again.  this is not to say that the things you have heard are wrong, but they also don’t paint a complete picture of what my experience was, at the very least.

i was a premed, and it’s true that there are some cutthroat people in that community. but it’s also true that i’ve met and made friends with some of the most wonderful, selfless, caring people who were also premeds. one of my best premed friends, who i met at the beginning of freshman year, has been nothing but supportive to me these past four years, to the point where we’d always celebrate each other’s accomplishments instead of envying then, and always turn to each other in times of trouble instead of tearing each other down.

i applied to many clubs in freshman year, and was rejected from quite a few of them. yet the ones i eventually joined were such loving, friendly communities that by sophomore year, i’d forgotten the sting of rejection and instead spent the next few years trying to give back to my club communities so that new folks would feel as welcomed as i did.

i took classes with some professors who never knew i was even there. but i also took classes with professors who would reach out to me without my asking to see how i was doing, or to schedule a time to chat about my career or my concentration.

i’m rambling a bit, but i hope i’ve made it clear that even with all the annoyances and grievances and troubles, both big and small, my time at harvard was full of amazing people and wonderful experiences. really, anywhere you go, there will be all sorts of negative moments, but ultimately, the quality of your college experience is really up to you. whatever you decide to do, i wish you well."
1164,"hey, class of 2021 here. 

use visitas to your best opportunity and get a feel for the school.

you should always remember that people are more likely to talk shit about their school, especially when they have very high expectations. no one talks shit about harvard like its students. 

but, i also don't want to disillusion you either. i've observed a lot of the things you're worried about, so to be honest there is some truth in the perception. yes it's very hard, socially and academically competitive, exhausting, stressful etc. but it is definitely manageable. stem classes here are definitely hell though, but i'm pretty sure stem is hell everywhere. try to use this time to think critically about what you want from the harvard experience, and let that guide you through your time here. you can definitely mitigate the bad by finding an environment where you feel comfortable.

about the dorms: yeah most suck, and a few are nice, but the nicest ones are all the way in the quad. dorm quality is radically inconsistent depending on the house, location, etc. oh also no air conditioning. move in is always the absolute fucking worst.

about the food: lol yeah it does suck especially annenberg (where you'd getting your food all of frehshmen year).  it might look like hogwarts the food certainly doesn't taste like it. also tourist sneaking in through the back door while you're just tryna eat lunch is annoying. but get used to bold tourists. they're everywhere, especially in the yard. but they sure do make for funny stories!

about the harvard vloggers: lmao pay them no mind, their content is comedically ridiculous. both i and many of my friends have made fun of that stupid ""why 4.0 at harvard is a failure"" video. they exaggerate a lot to make things more interesting, but i can tell you it's really not that deep. honestly i haven't heard anyone say particularly nice things about the vloggers and their content.

you'll do fine wherever you end up, just focus on your own college goals and you'll be ok. lmk if you have any questions since we'll be on campus in the same era. good luck!!"

&#x200b;

the social atmosphere is what you make of it. i have the most wholesome, incredible roommates who i'm so lucky to be blocking with next year, and i couldn't have asked for better friends or supporters in my first year. i've joined all the extracurricular groups i wanted to (the crimson, hsa, the harvard-radcliffe orchestra, etc.), and i've met amazing friends in all of them. my only limitation is that i overcommitted, lmao, which is absolutely a personal problem since i'm not taking cutthroat stem classes or anything.

i know you can meet amazing people anywhere, but i feel like being immersed in a community of great peers is an aspect where harvard is almost unparalleled. ""amazing people"" doesn't just mean everyone's a genius; the most important consequence of this, for me, is that people **dedicate themselves to the extracurriculars they commit to.** there's less flakiness, more passion, and more interesting things happening on campus because people, on average, try to make time for a more balanced academic life.

&#x200b;

also, seriously, annenberg + housing are good!!! i  like the food most days; there's a really nice variety. they bring in richardson's ice cream consistently every sunday, there are kbbq ""bistro bowls,"" sweet potato tots, etc. there's rarely a day when i dislike everything on the menu. i like to think i have decently high standards for food, and i literally do not know how other people are getting that berg is horrible. and even though i'm just in freshman housing, i've been told we have massive rooms + common rooms compared to dorms at tufts/uchicago/usc."
1169,"hey man i’m a grad student at hes and imo the experience is just like any other university. yes there are smart people and they may be competitive (making generalizations as i did not go to the college) but i did my undergrad in engineering at rutgers and the students there were equally competitive. remember in general terms, everyone is competing for the same jobs and opportunities at this level (be it ivy or another large university) so it’s natural to be more competitive that hs. with that said, i don’t think that it will impact your experience. you will still be able to make friends and join clubs and take full advantage of what harvard has to offer. 

again from a graduate perspective at hes, everyone has been supportive and engaging in my time at harvard. classmates are great, professors are interesting and the overall experience has been phenomenal. not sure exactly the translation to the harvard college experience,  but i’m sure they are more alike than dissimilar. 

if you have specific questions or anything feel free to pm but i think you will be pleasantly surprised when you arrive in cambridge!   "
1170,"seriously, don’t worry— the experience is what you make of it. i would say the least happy people i know here are those who didn’t really find a community or a good group of friends, which is very easy to do if you make the effort. there are so many sweet clubs and opportunities to take advantage of here and everyone can find something they like! i really think this is a function of how everyone loves to complain— at the end of the day, it’s still harvard and i have had so much to be grateful for."
1171,">	everyone loves to complain about their school. mit, tufts, boston college, arizona state, wherever.... you’ll find people with complaints (both valid and not) about their school

this is very true. it’s what *you* make of the experience there is what really matters.

viewing videos of john fish saying how his 4.0 was a failure actually could be looked at that self care is more important than school work.

pretty much go and enjoy the amenities and experiences offered (meeting friends, going to parties, whatever you enjoy) and dont stress over school work. look at it this way, there are people out there that would literally be willing to pay millions to be in your position, an undergrad at harvard... and you don’t have to. enjoy the four years doing whatever, just have fun!

1174,"widener vs. lamont makes a difference here. i demand a breakdown by location in the next poll.

1175,"harvard student here. been there, done that."
1176,"> harvard student here.

why else would you be commenting if you weren't? don't feel the need to validate yourself."
1177,"it demands a strong background and time commitment, just like any other advanced/accelerated course. it is difficult simply because it covers 2-3 classes worth of material. you could create an equally difficult course by just adjoining more topics to another course and increasing the pace. 

what's astonishing to me is that harvard continues to have students that are willingly and able to keep up with this pace. you could offer the class anywhere, but i don't think you'd have as much interest as in here or another very successful institution."
1178,"the difficulty is extremely dependent on the professor teaching. but i’d say its still the hardest freshman math class in the world irrespective of instructor. there are more advanced math classes at harvard but they probably require less work.

this year auroux is teaching it. before that it was joe harris for a couple years. i saw the harris pset once, and it didnt look bad at all. however before that gaitsgory taught it and im sure it was madness. my guess is that auroux will lie somewhere between the two but who knows."
1179,"people usually rate it as the toughest class they took at harvard (i know many who took it). but exactly how tough it is depends on who teaches it (and who is taking it). 

for example, d. gaitsgory is famous for making it a brutal class with students averaging 50+ hours a week on the homework alone. but other profs who teach it often just treat it like any other honors freshman class. 

regardless of who teaches it though, the actual material is somewhat tame (looking back on it at least). it basically covers sophomore level math (real analysis, group and ring theory, topology, and manifolds). there are other freshman classes that cover most of those topics (e.g. math 25, which i took), but the difference is how in-depth math 55 goes. it typically teaches the material at a much more mature level, closer to an upper level course or graduate course. this is because it expects the enrollees to be already very familiar with the proceedings and conventions of higher math. the homework is also *significantly* trickier than any other freshman math class.

so, in summary, probably what sets it apart most is not the material, but the people taking it, the professor, and how it is taught."
1180,"yeah, all the hard classes at harvard are just challenging and time consuming. math 55 is top 5 i think, but not top 2. cs 161 has the highest hours and there’s a quantum physics course in second i think?"
1181,i love harvard lawyers
1182,"i don't think that means this was wasted—harvard and the amicus filers made an airtight case, and the trump admin recognized this and didn't want to prolong their humiliation at the hands of the hated leftist foreigner intellectual elites"
1183,"from harvard's website ([https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants/considering-gap-year](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants/considering-gap-year)), there's 80-110 who defer their admissions; keep in mind that number is inflated by students who take mandatory gap years (military, z-list, last minute emergencies, etc.). i sent in my request a few days ago and am waiting to hear back; i've heard from an ex-ao that harvard usually limits them to 120 per year, but obviously they may make an exception this year. nonetheless, if you want to take a gap year, i'd really recommend sending that out asap."
1184,"harvard is also very strong at theoretical cs and algorithms. while mit programming classes might be better, harvard’s theory holds up a lot better."
1185,"i think the culture difference between the two schools is fairly significant and the employment opportunities between the two schools is small enough that the former vastly outweighs the latter in choosing your school. the cs department at harvard, while much smaller than that of mit, still has world-class faculty, and plenty of harvard graduates recruit at the big tech companies. if you don't vibe with the mit culture then you'll probably have a poor experience; being miserable at a better school would not be worth any marginal benefit for your career.

> maybe less opportunities for cs internships, since harvard seems to be leaning more liberal arts

not sure what you mean by this. perhaps the tech career fairs might be smaller at harvard due to the smaller pool? but this by no means restricts what you can actually apply for."
1186,"as i am sure you are aware, you can take cs classes at mit as a harvard student. this tends to be in the 3rd and 4th years, but if there was a high level class that you were particularly interested in, you can still take it."

1189,"""i think the housing system in both places is fine for me.""

many of the harvard houses probably have more character and traditions."
1190,"unlike the other commenters, i’d argue that mit offers more opportunity (or at least makes it more accessible) for cs undergrads to work at top quant shops (like two sigma, jane street, de shaw, etc.), making it so there \*is\* a significant compensation difference between the two schools at the top quartile if you really want to make money. academically, i’ve found that my friends in course 6 are having an easier time than their counterparts at harvard, and that there are a significant number of “normal” people with 5.0 gpas in eecs. this, combined with mit’s poker and quant clubs, make it so placement at top firms is incomparable.

i found mit’s pride in its geeky/ hacking culture off-putting when i was debating where to matriculate before attending the admit weekends – going to cpw (and comparing it with a disappointing visitas) was an eye-opening experience that endeared me to mit’s passion and it sucks a lot that you’re missing out on that experience. i find geekiness to be synonymous with wholesomeness here, and despite the large number of course 6 majors, i don’t find the environment to be nearly as cutthroat or pre-professional as harvard’s.

the social culture at harvard is a lot more exclusionary; freshman feeder clubs for the final clubs like the hasty pudding recruit almost exclusively from certain zip codes (ues/greenwich/atherton); students have to “comp” – vernacular for having multiple interviews and an intense selection process – for clubs, and there’s a lot of socioeconomic coagulation as harvard admits hundreds of students from a select number of prep schools (dalton/trinity/brearley/exeter/lville) every year. it is often these students who benefit the most from harvard’s network and dominate the social scene. please feel free to dm me if you have any further questions, and congratulations on the options!"
1191,"this became a long-ass post.

tl;dr: *think long-term. think of what you envision doing in twenties and what field in cs  that makes you feel great.*

hi. i'm an incoming graduate student. i feel the need to help these cute duckling aspiring cs undergrad students :)

i did a cs undergraduate, worked in faang as a software engineer for half a decade. i've been an interviewee for faang, then an interviewer for my company, and gave too many interviews i lost count, made hiring decisions, turned down several ivys and stanford (hehe), and hired several non-target grads. i feel like i am qualified to help people reach this decision (seen more than one mit vs harvard cs posts), as i've struggled myself with figuring out if i want to be academic or industry, and how to achieve success and excellence.

both are fantastic programs, and you can't go exactly wrong in either. i've also seen my friends from both schools go on to successful careers in tech. that said, the devil is in the details.

for example, do you think you might like compilers? do you like to work on demanding kernel-level code to squeeze out some performance gains and relish that? do you like to pore over the details of, let's say, speculative execution and figure out if implementing that with x amount of l1 cache is worth it? or do you think you want to create a new algo for an unsupervised learning method that can increase the target success rate? etc. these interests might actually help you make the difference of whether you want to attend mit or harvard. some have professors that are stronger than other. and the labs you worked in, or the prof you worked with for your senior thesis will make a difference in what you do in your first few steps after undergrad, and that will start building your expertise. so that's where things come down to.

lastly, i decided not to pivot to management/generalist too early in undergrad. it served me well. cs and tech now is a very deep discipline and takes a while to build up deep knowledge that is hard for other people to replicate and steal/replace you. you will literally become so indispensable because of your expertise, that they have no other option than to give you that raise, and make facebook, say, outbid you by 100k cash bonus with more in stocks to steal/retain you. so, even if you want to make a lot of money doing venture things, i'd advise you to stay technical for majority of your twenties, and plan bigger. at least that's what i believe in, and has served me quite well.

feel free to pm me for any advice, for what it's worth.

edit: yes, one might glean from this post where i personally come down on harvard cs v. mit cs but a subtle one."
1192,"a lot of these commenters are from harvard (understandably, since were on the harvard sub), but i think there are a lot of assumptions being made about mit culture and social life. here are thoughts from a current mit student:

while harvard and mit culture are definitely different and mit gets the more nerdy or socially awkward rep, when i came to mit, i was surprised by how “normal” a lot of of people are. yeah, some of these kids are geniuses that grinds their way through high school, but that doesn’t mean they don’t know how to socialize or be a normal person. in a similar thread, i saw a commenter describe mit as more blue collar than harvard, which i agree with completely. there are many many kids from public schools, first generation students, immigrants, etc at mit which i believe makes the community a lot more diverse and welcoming to everyone 

it’s hard to convey through stuff you see through mit, but there are so many groups on campus and you can definitely find a social group that will fit you. also there are a lot of different dorms that each have their own culture, but that’s something you need to be in to understand. the i3 videos imo are pretty cringey and aren’t a great representation of each dorm. 

a very large percentage of campus is affiliated (~50% of men, ~30% of women), and the frats and sororities have different cultures, but the greek community is very real and it’s easy to meet new people through it.

as for business school, mit let’s you take classes in sloan as an undergrad, so you can get a head start on these and figure out if that’s what you want to do, as well as make connections that can help you into sloan or any other top business school. 

for internships, i’ve honestly never felt like i was competing with my fellow mit students for spots. even when we’re interviewing at the same time for the same position, it’s more of a “i hope we both get it” mentality instead of “i need to beat them” mentality. i really doubt companies have a limit on how many mit students they’ll accept. also, having so many cs students just means you know more people at more companies, which is a plus to me. i can easily get a referral at top companies just by hitting up friends 

feel free to dm me for anymore info if you’d like! just wanted to offer a different perspective"
1193,"i said this in the other thread, and i'll say it again. i think mit is better than harvard at undergraduate cs pedagogy. but no, you will not be disadvantaged when it comes to jobs. all the major tech companies, and many prop shops, hfs, quant places, all come here as well and hire plenty of kids, as long as your skills are up to par. please do not let this be the deciding factor. i can't tell you how many kids i'll see from harvard if i look at de shaw's linkedin page. (it's still hard to get into those places, btw, no matter how great your school is, but harvard only improves your chances) and when it comes to tech and quant recruiting, the school you attend will help you a lot at getting an interview, but during the interview, it's all up to you. so i'm telling you -- this doesn't matter.

i know this is a really tough choice. i can't tell you what the right one is, unfortunately, and i agree that cross-registering is an imperfect solution. on top of the logistical hassle, you also just want to be attending the school you chose to attend, not supplementing it by going somewhere else for a bunch of classes. plus, things like finding groups to work with can be difficult since you won't be embedded in the other school's social culture.

in my comment on that other post, i mentioned that i didn't want to attend mit back then (i never even applied) because of the nerdy social culture. while i am still not the biggest fan of that culture (and other people in this thread have hinted that it's not as overbearing as one might think), in hindsight, if i had the choice between the schools, i would have rather picked mit. i love harvard, i love the friends i've made here, the house community, the research and career opportunities i've been afforded, but i did not realize how stuffy the social culture would be, and i also didn't appreciate the nuances of the differences in quality between seas at other schools and at harvard.

good luck with your decision! pm if you wanna chat more."
1194,do a bachelor at harvard and master at mit.
1195,"in my opinion, if you are purely stem-oriented, harvard is nowhere near the best school that you should opt for. mit hands-down should take the cake for this area of study. 

harvard, like all other ivy league schools, is heavily liberal arts focused. especially for undergraduate programs, harvard students take a large number of humanity and social science courses throughout their years at the institution. when's the last time you've heard harvard bragging about producing engineers and computer scientists? exactly. 

lots of stem people i know don't even respect harvard that much because they know it's an arts-oriented university with little in the way to offer for their interests. if you want to succeed in stem, go to mit. if you want to succeed in anything other than stem, then harvard is the way to go. 

trust me, an engineering degree from mit is far more prestigious and recognized than a gender studies degree from harvard. most people i've heard who got into harvard come from grade-inflating private schools whose parents literally bought their way into a sports scholarship. mit students are actually smarter and career-oriented, while harvard only tends to care about bragging rights. 

if you want to become a world-class surgeon i can definitely understand the post-grad push for a harvard program. but for undergrad? i'd steer well clear of harvard unless your parents are millionaires and are connected like hell. nobody cares about the school you went to when you're making the big bucks and are this close to entering an assistant ceo position at a fortune 500 company. 

go to mit if you want to change the world. go to harvard if you want to sit on top of your ivory tower with your crappy arts degree."
1196,">unlike the other commenters, i’d argue that mit offers more opportunity (or at least makes it more accessible) for cs undergrads to work at top quant shops (like two sigma, jane street, de shaw, etc.), making it so there \*is\* a significant compensation difference between the two schools at the top quartile if you really want to make money. academically, i’ve found that my friends in course 6 are having an easier time than their counterparts at harvard, and that there are a significant number of “normal” people with 5.0 gpas in eecs. this, combined with mit’s poker and quant clubs, make it so placement at top firms is incomparable.

i'd dispute this point specifically. harvard quant placement is really good, arguably better than mit. an imperfect metric would be using linkedin to compare school affiliations at top quant firms (assuming representative samples). harvard blows mit out of the water at d.e. shaw, and they're practically neck and neck everywhere else. taking the combination of the three listed companies gives 123 harvard affiliates vs. 95 for mit. of course, there's no easy way to sort by undergrad school, but this rough analysis indicates no significant difference."
1197,"agree with pretty much all of this except for the difference in career opportunities. ditto what /u/ap36020 says -- harvard is absolutely fine, if not even better, for placement at quant shops. 

but yeah, mit's social scene sounds a lot more inclusive and less toxic for low-income folk. glad to hear that mit's geeky culture was not as off-putting as you thought it would've been going in. that was the biggest thing stopping me from applying to mit in the past."
1198,"> while mit feels like an ibm office building built in the 1970s.

this is a blazing hot take i always see on the internet but rarely on campus. as someone who has seen all of campus and read quite a bit on the architecture on campus and the urban planning of campus (thanks o'robert simha), i can't help but disagree, honestly.

maybe all of your classes were in the 35 - 38 buildings or 24/26? that's the closest that gets to this description, and 34 is being renovated pretty heavily. not to mention the [aggressive](https://capitalprojects.mit.edu/projects/kendall-square-site-4) [east](https://capitalprojects.mit.edu/projects/kendall-square-site-5) [cambridge](https://capitalprojects.mit.edu/projects/kendall-square-site-1) [expansion,](https://capitalprojects.mit.edu/projects/kendall-square-site-3) the sloan buildings, the media lab, mit nano, and the various historical buildings (main group, walker, 70 amherst). 

then you have the koch buildings, the renovated daggett chocolate company buildings (e17-19), and whatever-the-hell stata is. another under-rated building is probably 66, with its nice art and color scheme and close approximation to the golden ratio. i've had my friends' jaws drop walking into 6c, the theoretical physics building.

i feel like a more apt description is ""varied exterior architecture with silicon valley herman miller interior design"" because that's what i'm seeing. idk, it just kills me every time i read this re-hashed take. like, yes, it's ok to not like mit's campus (and i don't like harvard's), but distilling the surprisingly rich variety of architectural thought and design into ""ibm office building from the 1970s"" is frustrating."
1199,"theoretical stuff is used at companies too. pretty much every coding interview has theoretical questions. theory doesn't necessarily mean cutting-edge new research algorithms, it's also comparing existing algorithms and about making optimal implementation choices. 

&#x200b;

if your primary goal is to get a job at microsoft or google right out of college, mit is \*probably\* the better place to go. if you're good at either school you can get whatever job you want, but from what i've seen your odds are better at mit. harvard's cs and engineering are improving a lot, but haven't caught up completely, and industry recruiters \*definitely\* haven't figured out how good harvard's programs are yet. 

&#x200b;

that being said, i really hope you see education as more than a pathway to your first job out of college. the actual coding you learn at either school is very unlikely to be related to the job you do at a tech company job, and the skills you learn will be obsolete soon enough either way. i can't tell you which school is the right choice for you, but the questions you're asking make it seem like you're making this choice to maximize the probability of certain job opportunities right out of the gate, which i believe will have much less impact on your life than you think."
1200,"i'm speaking specifically to the statistics given by mit and harvard's career centers, as mit (sans citadel, w/ ken griffin from harvard undergrad) alumni are more strongly represented in quant finance. i don't doubt the strength of harvard's quant placement, as harvard and mit interchangeably place first for putnam, but being immersed in the quant world (and comparing my experiences with friends at harvard), i'd argue still, specifically for software engineering roles at 2s, hudson river, etc., that mit places better, especially for cs majors rather than the strongest math/ physics students out of consideration for op."
1201,"54 is being renovated and so is 34. it honestly seems like you didn't read my response because choosing stata is the exact opposite of ""an ibm office building built in the 1970s."" and yeah, i don't like stata too much, but i provided many other examples that you've quickly ignored.

>don't even get me started on mit's libraries lol. do you even have one that doesn't feel like a prison library?

also being renovated and i've studied in harvard's libraries quite a bit. the functional difference is at most marginal except you have more bathrooms.

it's so clear from your response that you didn't read mine, so i'm just going to stop here. when a student deciding between our schools posted in /r/harvard, i gave well-intentioned advice without trashing your school even though i could have. the student (op) was not even interested in facilities - they clearly outlined what they wanted more information about, and you've gone out of your way to trash our buildings. you're clearly not interested in extended the same form of respect that i did. i hope op realizes that this reflects poorly on you and not all of harvard."
1202,"i highly agree. i feel like when people say harvard theory is better than that of mit, that might be true as far as faculty and research goes, but definitely not when it comes to undergraduate pedagogy. 

i took 124 and i really wish i had heeded the advice of a friend who told me to do 6.006 + 6.046. it would've been way more productive. 124 was so overly difficult, both for psets and exams, that i think it was unproductive. i recall so many office hour sessions where no one has absolutely any clue how to do anything and tas need to spoon-feed answers. i also took it with jelani, and he's a cool dude but that class was bloody murder. i feel like the only kids who really benefit are math 25/55/math competition kids. 

agree with the kohler take +1. too bad i'm too scared of 161 to experience mickens :("
1203,"if you’re from outside the northeast, people (locals) will feel cold and distant in both boston and new haven. remember though, the students you meet and befriend will be with you for many years. i promise you’ll find that at either school. from a quality of life perspective, i’d rank cambridge very near the top for a college student. for what you’re studying, you’ll have cross-enrollment opportunities with mit, and access to research in some of the most cutting edge labs in the world. i’d choose harvard."
1204,"i think the greatest thing about harvard, struturally, is the freedom it affords you. you are in the driver's seat. you have the freedom to make your experience whatever you want it to be. if that means taking hard classes and pushing yourself far beyond anything you've done before, you can do that. if that means taking it relatively easy, you can do that too. it's up to you how you want to spend your time, and lots of people have classes/clubs across all their interests and really follow their curiosities. 

harvard is a lot of things, but i don't find it to be cutthroat or competitive at all. you have a lot of hard-working, ambitious kids in one place, but everyone is going through the same real struggles, so usually people are far more collaborative and just want to learn and become the best person they can be. don't let this make you underestimate how difficult classes can be however, they just aren't competitive in that the focus is on learning.

socially, i think harvard is very special. i've never met so many unique, interesting, like-minded, and generally good-hearted people. the community is wonderful and very tight knit, even though we might spend too much time on psets. everytime i walk around campus i see familiar faces and it always brings a smile to my face. 

finally, cambridge and boston are wonderful places to spend your college years. i really don't think new haven is even comparable.

if i were you, i think my choice would be clear. best of luck"
1205,"when i was in college, i dated a yale undergrad and spent a lot of time on campus at yale for a few years. i later went to harvard law school, where i had a job with a lot of harvard undergrad colleagues. in other words, i did not attend yale college or harvard college, but had years of up-close experience with both communities.

the first thing i would say is that you should attend the school that’s better for what you want to study. they’re both excellent schools, and that should come first. but assuming both are roughly equal in your intended major, or you don’t know what you want to study, read on.

i am from connecticut, but i have to admit that new haven is not the greatest city. cambridge is far, far better, and boston is also great and very close to cambridge. no comparison there. yale feels a bit like a fortress surrounded by an unsympathetic urban landscape. harvard is in “friendly territory”: a city with about forty colleges and universities in and around it. new haven isn’t scary or anything. but it’s a bit gritty.

i would say that yale focuses much more on its undergrad experience than harvard does. yale has really excellent facilities for undergrads at the colleges. they’re little worlds unto themselves. harvard houses are also great, and some are very impressive facilities, but they’re not as self-contained. yale colleges are bubbles; harvard houses are more connected to the surrounding area. also, yale colleges have very strong identity and spirit. harvard houses have spirit too, but not to the yale extent. 

if you were a grad student, i’d say harvard for sure (all else being equal). but undergrad is really what yale prides itself on, and it does seem to be a very special experience. yale undergrads feel like a very elite, special cohort (even if mainly to themselves), even more than harvard ones do. yale’s actual campus is much more architecturally beautiful and emotionally engaging (to me, anyway) than harvard’s, but its surroundings are uglier and less fun. yale felt like more of a pressure cooker than harvard; the undergrads are all trying to subtly prove how awesome they are through their impressive activities and clubs, even more than at harvard. the prevalence of secret societies feeds into this. harvard has final clubs, but they are arguably closer to (elite) fraternities than to secret societies. i personally think the secret societies, though alluring, are mostly a bad thing. but if you want to attend mysterious ancient-seeming rites in a windowless “tomb,” yale’s the place to do it.

overall, harvard is bigger, a tiny bit more relaxed, and more “normal,” in a way. imagine a large, prestigious university in any medium-sized american city, but just older and more historic and famous, with prestige turned to 10. yale feels more cloistered, elite, and set-apart, with its neo-gothic courtyards and parade of comestibles. think hogwarts, but in the ‘hood, with prestige also turned to 10 but everyone inside yale believing it’s turned to 11."
1206,"harvard for sure, esp with the interests you listed."
1207,"i'm from ft. worth!

what makes harvard great is that you will find people from everywhere across the globe and whatever little thing you're interested in, you will - i guarantee - find a community of people who are world-class in that too. it's a fantastic intellectual community and the people there are friendly. i don't know how this meme about people being ""cutthroat"" and ""competitive"" got started, but that's just a dumb stereotype - not. true.

i visited yale because i was admitted into their mba program years ago and i actually made friends with the guy who showed me around campus and keep in contact with him to this day. yale has the same vibe, but is a much smaller community.

if harvard is baroque, yale is rococo.

you can't go wrong with either - you'll make lifelong friends and have a great time.

the comment one person made about people in the northeast being ""colder"" …. well, there is some of that, but mainly what i've observed is that people are simply busy and have a lot going on. so they can only carve out so much time to be social. the type of people who go to highly (admissions) competitive schools are the ones who just can't sit still and want to always have their minds occupied.

your mileage may vary, but that's my take."
1208,"you'd be able to do well at both places. premeds are competitive everywhere you go. there are plenty of clubs in either place.

with harvard, there would greater diversity of opportunities for extracurriculars and research since outside of the immediate cambridge campus, you have potential opportunities at mit, other boston schools, mgh, the longwood medical area (e.g. dana-farber, brigham and women's hospital)."
1209,"i would recommend harvard. harvard and the location are going to connect you to all the things that you are looking for. 

i am currently in dallas, texas, if you have any questions."
1210,"a lot of others have made some great general comparisons for you, but i wanted to speak to your interests specifically.

in the ivy league i think we have one of the more up-and-coming engineering departments, especially considering how our life sciences are so incredibly strong. we just built a hugeeeee school of engineering and applied sciences complex that is stunning and was set to open this year. there is the broad institute of mit and harvard and the wyss institute for biologically-inspired engineering at harvard which are both a m a z i n g places with no other real alternatives anywhere else on the planet from a research standpoint. plenty of undergrads i know are working in amazing labs. my freshman friend is in the process of getting into pardis sabeti's lab, she won time person of the year for her work on infectious diseases surrounding ebola--oh, and she teaches one of the introductory bio classes. i took a freshman seminar with--quite literally--one of the top 5 most important people in gene editing / crispr (david liu). only 10 other people were in that class, and learning from him was one of the most surreal experiences of my life.

pre-med is competitive everywhere, but it's a spectrum. i've met a ton of really chill premeds and a ton of not-so-chill premeds. in my experience, advising has been very great: from academic advisers, to first-year proctors and major-specific advisers. but seriously though harvard people are not cut-throat / competitive on average, stereotype is bullshit. maybe we have less chill than other schools but i definitely don't feel pressured.

pre-professional life here is very strong. i think you would fit right in in many of the pre-professional organizations we have on campus, which there are a ton of.

i am not sure about film organizations though almost every week there seems to be a screening of some movie pubbed around campus. 

plenty of opportunities for art! one of our big gened classes is a painting seminar, that is super chill and you paint for several hours each week. there is a freshman-only art room and many of the upperclassmen dorms have similar spaces i believe. 

i write for one of the school publications. publications on campus are absolutely f a n t a s t i c. the crimson does incredible work. the lampoon is weird as fuck but amazing all in its own. the advocate is a cult and creates awesome literary works. harvard political review has some amazing opinion pieces. the harvard independent exists. harvard science review is pretty cool. there's a slew of smaller publications that are also awesome reads.

> if someone looks lost on campus, will someone typically approach them to help? are people friendly?

as others mentioned, this is new england / east coast, lol. people are less approachable but as an east coaster i'm used to it and like it that way. i mean if you're a freshman everyone else is happy to help you. plenty of tourists stop us sometimes with weird requests or just requests for directions, which can get annoying.

feel free to dm me w your questions."

1212,"hey, i’m from the south and go to harvard. the people are super nice at harvard. there is a huge cultural difference between north and south, but it is the same at yale or harvard. most of my friends are from the south. despite being the first person in my family not to go to community college, i was able to join a social org and have a wonderful experience here. i love to and can not recommend harvard enough. also, boston is wayyyyy better than new haven in regards to stuff to do and opportunity."
1213,yale is very inward looking-the college experience is the end goal. harvard is very outward looking-a jumping off place to what’s next (both during and after the four years)
1214,"first congratulations. acceptance is a significant achievement and shows you to be an individual of great promise. i know of no finer institution of the liberal arts, anywhere. as someone with a very close relative who attended harvard, i have seen the struggles and the results. it's harvard hands down. its hard as fuck. you must bring your a-game to every moment you are there. there is no cutting of slack, this is a crucible.  however, attending and graduating harvard is akin to having your ticket punched to a good life. harvard will equip you with the tools to be successful. harvard will connect you. the people you meet at harvard will be most certainly be tomorrow's leaders, in many areas or fields of endeavor. the friendships you form will carry your thru the most difficult of times. i promise that you will be agog, at the quality of your fellow students. that quiet guy in your 9am class? he's a concert level pianist who is also the top of his class in microbiology. the cute girl, you keep running into and will eventually date? her family owns a winery in france, she vacations in switzerland and her paper on global inequality and green industrial policy will eventually lead her to a position at think-tank in washington dc, advising the leaders of several countries. your best friend, whom you met in cs51, and who's head you will hold above the toilet after too much drinking - he's already started his second cloud company. there are so many moments in college at harvard; freezing your ass off waiting for the t. getting into the final club you wanted. i confess i envy you.  however, harvard will impose, and require of you a difficult thing, you will be asked, as one to whom much has been given, much will also be expected. to be good and to do good. as a future leader, in whatever field or endeavor you follow you will be expected to excel, pursuing both excellence and achievement, while maintaining a deep humility and self-awareness. you will be expected to carry the precepts and spirit of harvard forward in all of your tasks and efforts. 

do not make the mistake, there is no second best. pick harvard. your future depends on it.

and i wish you the very best"
1215,"idk about pre-med, but i can comment on the other things.

one of the greatest myths about harvard is that we're so cutthroat. in fact, literally everybody i've met here has been incredibly supportive, willing to share their study guides at 3 am the morning before a big test or offering to help me with flashcards. stuff like that. 

the harvard college film festival (hcff) is a great club for film enthusiasts, and there are a ton of different outlets for writing, from the crimson to the gazette to satire v. i think this place uniquely allows you to find a balance between extracurricular stuff and your ultimate goals. congratulations on your acceptance, yuck fale, and good luck with your future!"
1216,"thinking from the perspective of my friend who got waitlisted by harvard, i’d recommend you to choose yale 😶"
1217,"i was a premed at harvard. some are competitive in a bad way, but in my concentration (chemistry) we were very competitive in a positive way. we encouraged and helped each other and had a close knit community. some of my fondest memories are working on problem sets late into the night in a mather dining hall with my fellow chem classmates. others were from being the pioneer class of chem 100r (is it still offered?) in nw labs. 

to op, choose harvard, especially if you are premed. the proximity to boston will enable unparalleled access to a phenomenal medical community."
1218,"my great grandfather was the dean of harvard business and my grandpa had an apartment in cambridge. the area is very welcoming to all ages. the campus is really nice too. 

new haven on the other hand, not so much.  i’m from connecticut but i don’t know anything about yale’s campus."
1219,"you will get your grades but only if you personally visit larry bacow at his vacation home in southwestern florida, knock on his door and sing the entirety of “fair harvard”. after that he will give you your grades but you have to tell him that harvard is changing the fossil fuel industry from the inside and say “no multicultural center” over and over until he hands you your transcript."
1220,"removing your e-mail from certain directories (i.e. selecting 'internal print' vs 'electronic', or both, etc.) is possible through my.harvard, though i forget exactly how.

1221,"i have not truly had this experience . generally when i think i’m a fraud, i am, but i don’t give up and i keep working until it isn’t true anymore or i admit i shouldn’t be doing what i’m doing and change gears. asking questions and being honest (not falsely humble, but actually honest) about my shortcomings helps. at the end of the day, i remind myself that i got into harvard, but not without help. i have since graduated with a respectable gpa, but i was never the top of any of my classes (except digging the glyphs, i was a savant in that class). i also was never in danger of failing even when i bombed midterms. it all evens itself out in the end. "
1222,"other commenters have given great advice regarding camhs and speaking to your res dean and/or academic advisor.

&#x200b;

regarding how to talk to your professors:  i'm a professor, although not at harvard.  the vast, vast majority of professors are absolutely understanding of mental health difficulties.  there are all kinds of ways they can support you, from extensions to alternate assignments to postponing exams.  i promise you, 98% of professors wish their students would communicate \*more\* about mental health status.  we are rooting for every single student, and it is so heartbreaking when a student drops of the radar, and we can't help, because they don't talk to us.  


how exactly to do it?  a short email.  

>hi professor so-and-so,    
>  
>i am a student in your whatever class, and i'm writing to seek some extra help.  unfortunately, i am dealing with some mental health issues lately \[feel free to be more specific if you are comfortable!\], and i have been finding it hard to keep up.  this class is very important to me, and i really want to stay involved.  would you be willing to consider allowing me to \[complete late assignment x\]/\[have an extension on y\]/\[take exam z at another time\]/\[meet with me privately\], to help me re-engage with the class?    
>  
>many thanks,   
>  
>americandragonfruit

there is no scenario where i get an email like that and don't immediately start brainstorming ways to make it work.

&#x200b;

for the 2% of profs who are assholes:  this is another reason why communicating regularly with your res dean, advisor, and tutors (once you are housed) is super important.  they will document that you are truly in need, and they will advocate for you with professors.

&#x200b;

hope this helps, and good luck.  remember, you are absolutely at harvard for a reason, and everyone defines success differently.  grades aren't everything, following a traditional 4-year graduation path is not required, and your health is far more important than your accolades.

&#x200b;"
1223,"i haven’t used them personally, but i would start [here.](https://huhs.harvard.edu/services/counseling-and-mental-health) regarding your professors, if you have a good relationship with them, it may be worth sitting down and talking to them about it. you’re not the first student who has gone through this, and you won’t be the last. they probably have personal policies as to what they do with people in your situation. i fell behind in a class due to something of a similar vein. i asked my professor to talk, and we were able to sit down and figure out a plan that satisfied them, and salvaged my grade.

good luck, i hope you’re able to figure out what you need to."
1224,"looking at this post as a high school sophomore aspiring to attend harvard, i read this and think “what? how can you be depressed when you are attending harvard? it’s harvard!” but now i’m afraid that i’ll meet the same fate if accepted, but i don’t see how."
1225,"your yard dean can help with reaching out to profs too if you’re having a hard time with that. they’re your advocate for all things personal and academic within the world of harvard administration. if you don’t know them, you can get to them through your proctor, who is there to help you with stuff like this. "
1226,"harvard students are people. we deal with mental health issues like everyone else. it's not portrayed in the media because everyone assumes we're perfect. but in an incredibly high stress environment like this, those mental health problems can be seriously amplified."
1227,"""harvard"" from the outside and harvard as an actual institution with real people are two very different things. ""harvard"" is where every genius goes to succeed and cruises through to become the next president or fortune50 ceo; harvard is where freshmen have no idea what the fuck they're doing and feel overwhelmed and lost just like any kid does at a difficult school."
1228,"prestige isn't everything lmao

college transition can be rough and most harvard students are high performance high school students who might have not taken a break that they needed 

"
1229,do you guys feel that harvard has ample mental health services on campus where if you need help you can get it pretty quickly? (not emergencies but just general help)  
1230,"to me it’s the same as being a celebrity; i don’t understand how jim carrey can be depressed because in my small world “fame and money=happy” and “harvard student=happy”. i acknowledge that i am wrong, i know that i’m wrong but it’s still difficult for me to understand how such successful people can be depressed."
1231,"harvard students aren't all that ""successful"" in the way that you think. sure, sometimes we may get a few raised eyebrows from people out-of-state when we drop the ""i go to harvard"" but that's about it. it can be very stressful since so many people here are very talented and tend to overstretch themselves--trying to keep up in that environment pushes people to their limits. so in fact the more ""successful"" you come, the more stressed and isolated you can be since you're dealing with more work and less free time. happiness goes down the tank."
1232,"this is a very insightful editorial that is sorely needed because... oh yeah, cambridge has been doing that for years already (see: the former unsafe clusterfuck at inman square, now much worse to drive in but safer for everyone else).  cambridge routinely shuts down major roads for parties and events, like the block party in front of city hall on mass ave in central, mem drive for river walk, the upcoming oktoberfest in harvard square, etc.  cambridge has made navigation much harder at spots like where main st. meets mass ave and columbia, just as an example, because that intersection was awful.  harvard square itself is a nightmare to drive through because it's a pedestrian area.  this has generally been cambridge's approach to traffic problems.  but it really only applies in a few major spots, cambridge's main squares.  it's not needed in north cambridge, or down in cambridgeport, or in the huron ave area, for example."
1233,"i went a long time ago, but hopefully what i learned is still valid:

* take advantage of shopping period. (they still have that, right?) i took a freshman seminar that sounded cool but turned out to be a total waste of time. i wish i had tried out another course or two the first week, chosen to stay in a better one, and dropped the dud. you're at a place with a huge range of courses and some of the most amazing professors in the world. don't waste it on a class you're getting nothing out of.
* talk to professors. for much of my time at harvard, i thought you only went to see professors when you were having trouble with the work. what an idiot. it turns out that most of them actually care about their specialty, and would love to talk to students who want to know more about it. some of them are nobel prize winners or other amazing people -- how often do you get a chance to talk to people like that? (if you're wondering what you'd say, one possibility is to go discuss ideas you have for an upcoming paper or project in the course.)
* find at least one activity you're interested in that lets anyone participate. i made the mistake of comping for some things that i didn't realize were hard to get into, and ended up not accepted in any, and discouraged. "
1234,"hey. i wanted to thank you for this really awesome and thoughtful response. i wrote this question in a rush and on a whim, because i've been stressing a bit about making the most of college and finally unlocking my 'best self' when i get there. i've done well, but i haven't felt that well for most of my life. so hearing these suggestions on wellness is really great. 

i plan on studying the life sciences (probably neuroscience w/ a comp sci secondary) but i'm also such a glut for the nytimes and snazzy essay-type writing, so i'm really hyped to try and comp for the crimson (thanks for kind of affirming trying that out, i was on their comp website earlier today!). i partied a bit in high school, went way overboard one night and felt embarrassed and miserable, so i hope i learned my lesson there. and i actually got ankle surgery this summer so i'm arriving at harvard in a boot. soon as i'm out of that - joining the friendliest seeming sport asap to keep depression at bay. right now i'm thinking boxing or jiu jitsu.

so yeah. just thanks a ton. i'm gonna try and a)join a club sport, b) get out of the harvard bubble, and c) try to not get sucked into the stress culture you spoke of - had enough of that in high school, and i'm stressed enough as is. i hope you're doing well. thanks again."
1235,"thank you! most questions posted here are really practical and specific, which is sure to help the asker if they can get a response, but there's not really a harvard reddit community. i think that'd be awesome to have.  "
1236,"don’t bring it up, and don’t hide it. when it comes up naturally, mention it naturally and move on. and for those cases where there’s not a natural place to move on to, have a related subject ready that’s normal and not braggy. like:
a: so where do you go to school?
b: oh, i’m at harvard. 
a: [silence, or maybe some kind of snark]
b: yeah, it was really different moving up to boston from [hometown], i was excited about the big city but completely unprepared for the snow. "
1237,"every time you meet someone new, pretend to take a call mid conversation that requires you to discuss the fact that you go to harvard. works every time for me!"
1238,"i think one level of that is acceptable. saying “i went to school in boston” is enough for some people not to follow up and avoids the awkwardness that comes with dropping “the h bomb”. 

but yeah absolutely just say harvard if there are any follow up questions after that. any more evasiveness is super douchey"
1239,this is probably one of the odd people who come to primal scream with a camera - i always thought that it was out of line especially as many of them clearly were not related to harvard. 
1240,"wondering what this fellow's intention was. from the narrative, it seemed as if he was desperately looking for a ""release"" partner at the expense of a few poor harvard female students?"
1241,"wait is this post even about sex?

if not this is the most /r/harvard post ever"
1242,"airbnb really is your best bet if you want to get a place close to harvard on the cheap. i live in chicago but fly in two weeks out of the semester (usually) to work on projects and attend lecture - i always use airbnb, and as long as you read the reviews carefully, you get a good stay for a favorable price.

me, i go for the downscale prices because when i'm in cambridge i spend the minimum time possible in my lodging space."
1243,"there are some really good airbnb options around campus. 

also, check the following inns - all a walking distance from campus, they're actually great for a night stay:

* [a friendly inn at harvard](http://www.afinow.com/afi/)
* [a bed & breakfast in cambridge](http://cambridgebnb.com/)
* [irving house](http://irvinghouse.com/)
* [a cambridge house](http://www.acambridgehouse.com/) - this is a bit further out, so best with a subway ride or uber."
1244,"any reason you can't just walk into an apple store while you're here and buy one? like, why pre-order? (and as other commenters have said, there's one in the cambridgeside mall by mit and one across the river in boylston. google maps should help you figure out which is more convenient for where you're staying; from the middle of harvard square, cambridgeside is probably easier, but it depends.)"
1245,"the one i want has special configurations and and it's only available for shipping.
i just decided to order it online and ship it to harvard when i get my mailing address in august."
1246,"apple's website? no, for that you'd need to go an official apple location. the nearest one to harvard is in the cambridgeside galleria.

microcenter is an authorized reseller, you'd have to order through them to pick up at their store."
1247,"yeah, next time you find a harvard 8 or 9, think about it."
1248,"just got this email:

we want to provide an update regarding the delivery of your hard-earned harvard diploma.

we expect you are anxious to receive this symbol which represents a significant accomplishment. the degree program staff, too, are eager for you to receive your diploma. the university is working closely with our partners to ensure accurate and safe delivery to each of our graduates.

we received updates from our printer and shipping partner that diplomas are scheduled to be mailed by the end of june. shipping times can vary due to the covid-19 pandemic and any local conditions affecting delivery.

please take note:

* an adult signature will be required at the time of delivery (where available). multiple deliveries may be attempted.
* we may be able to provide shipment tracking information after the diplomas are sent. we will send an additional message once that option is available.
* any returned diplomas will be stored safely at our hes offices, and we will contact you via email once harvard is able to resume normal office operations."
1249,you'll get respect once you get that harvard diploma. https://m.imgur.com/nz19nbp
1250,"it would still be worth it for people without families who want to experience the culture of harvard. also, people that work in cambridge or harvard staff who take hes courses would be able to stop worrying about the commute everyday."
1251,"there's a homeless shelter in harvard square that gets many donations from the businesses nearby (darwin's, salt and olives, starbucks, jp licks, lizzie's ,etc) and always have food. that is why the homeless people have food and can be a bit more picky when it comes to food."
1252,the homeless shelter has a lot of food and a lot of donations from most of the local expensive restaurants and cafes so food is not an issue for most of the homeless in harvard square
1253,"both great schools, so you really can't go wrong either way. the harvard science building does have food trucks outside usually. 

i think you need to consider what your post-grad plans are and whether eith program gives you a leg up. also consider the financial aid package offered. the harvard brand is much stronger than mit, so if all things are equal or close take harvard."
1254,"can’t go wrong with either, but harvard has a stronger network/brand. i *would* recommend you consider: which school has a better program for your 2nd or 3rd options for program of study? something like half of all undergrads change their degree at least once. 

also agree with the person that mentions taking your post grad plans into consideration. harvard likely will be better for you if medical school is a strong consideration (ex: potentially more grade inflation than mit)."
1255,harvard has lots of bio labs at the medical school campus and mgh. mit doesn't have nearly as many. (i'm a grad student at harvard in a biology-related program.)
1256,"from reading your post, it sounds like you already know the route you want to go. anecdotally, i don’t think there is much that mit can offer you that harvard cannot. i’m not sure the converse is true even though mit is a fantastic, world class institution that would certainly serve you well. keep in mind you can cross register between the two."
1257,"as an undergrad, i would have a look at the specific majors/concentrations available to you. i would argue that if you do the mainstream biology major (7) at mit vs the mcb concentration at harvard, it's likely to be a very similar experience. harvard's chemistry department has a more medicinal history, so the orgo experience probably has a different flavor. there are a broader range of interdisciplinary life sciences concentrations at harvard that focus on different areas (or at least there used to be). there's very little organismic/evolutionary biology at mit. on the other hand, related applied fields (e.g. biological or chemical engineering) are substantially stronger at mit and virtually nonexistent at harvard. so it somewhat depends on the kind of biology you'd like to do. in any case, i doubt any doors are going to be closed to you either way."
1258,"as a bio concentrator, i catch myself wondering what it’d be like if i went to mit instead, after seeing mit on the news constantly about the area of bio i’m in (synbio). but then i realize that there’s really no difference between going to the two - you’ll get a similar education and credentials. however, there are two main things to consider: first, i don’t think mit has a general education or distributional requirements? (might be wrong on this). this could be really helpful if you don’t care about the humanities or social sciences. however, secondly and conversely if you’re even a little bit interested in the humanities, harvard is the play. there are so many damn opportunities here in the humanities and ss that mit doesn’t really get. you’ll meet people from more diverse backgrounds, and have different networks compared to mit. so while the choice is in your hands, i believe this to be an important distinction between the schools."
1259,"broadly speaking, mit doesn't have the grade inflation problem, which people do factor in when hiring harvard bachs. also, the ib concentration at harvard is a bit wonky, and if you are super serious about your studies and getting a true education that is both well-rounded and has a solid foundation in the major biology fields, also go mit. harvard isn't bad, necessarily. all the professors in ib love their jobs and the classes they teach. but mit will be better for undergrad."
1260,"there is very little practical distinction between the set of lab opportunities available to students from these schools. anyone in the area can apply for an undergrad position in a lab at hms or the harvard/mit affiliated institutes (e.g. the broad, whitehead, etc.)."
1261,"sure, but in terms of ease of access, it's easier at one institution than the other. generally professors/researchers are more willing to take on students from their parent institution, and students are more likely to hear about opportunities affiliated with their own school. it's much easier to 1) be aware of certain lab opportunities at harvard if you're a harvard student and 2) once you hear about them, it's easier to work in the lab as a harvard student under a harvard professor."
1262,"yeah exactly. if there's space and demand for an undergrad, then labs at both schools would be happy to host someone from either school. there are some bureaucratic issues about card access that need to get sorted out, but it's all doable. if you end up in an hms lab that's in a harvard hospital, it's the same problem since the hospitals run their own employee and card access systems. (not sure why i'm getting downvoted for this view above... it's the truth!)"
1263,meh. good lab positions are not typically obtained by postings of opportunities. there's no big distinction in working in a harvard lab as an mit or harvard student. i've seen both.
1264,go to harvard medical school and have zero social life like the rest of us. 😂😂😭😭😭
1265,preach. literally i cannot stress how much i don’t recommend taking 5 classes unless you have to for some reason to graduate. i feel the same about advanced standing. enjoy college! harvard’s education isn’t just about the classroom it’s about the community.
1266,"if you haven’t already, please read the book mindset by carol dweck before class starts. it will change the way you look at failure forever! this is probably the book that got me into harvard in the first place, as i started going after more ambitious projects, freed from the paralyzing fear of ‘what if i fail at them’!"
1267,"a few things might help. first you’re living in your imagination. people aren’t as smart as you think. there are plenty of idiots- even at a place like harvard so don’t be intimidated. second, yes there are going to be people smarter than you, more able than you- but that’s okay. you’ve been running a long race to get here, now you’re here. don’t base your self expectations on your past performance. again be observant- this time of yourself. try new things out. surprise yourself. know that whatever happens to your grades you aren’t your grades. you’re you. third. pick up two books, maybe three. the practicing stoic by farnsworth, wherever you go there you are by zinn, and maybe as a preemptive feeling good by burns.

really though, you’ll be alright. get your head out of the clouds of your imagination, and don’t just look but observe everyone around you. you’ll notice everyone else is too busy worrying about themselves to notice the ketchup on your shirt."
1268,"“they can refer you to someone else” 

that’s the best thing about camhs right there.  they are free, but they are strapped. it’s hard to meet with a camhs physician more regularly then every 2-3 weeks given how many students they see, and it can feel like they’re focused on buzzwords rather than the individual because of it. seeing someone outside of harvard is much, much better. much much."
1269,"dumpling house.  best food around.  and i'm including five spices; dumpling house is better.  it's also better than shanghai fresh (that restaurant always disappoints me; i think it's going to be so good, but then... it's good, just not as good as i expect).  better than mulan.  haven't been to mary chung's in forever, though.  also, better than flame and cilantro.  no comparison with the kong.  holy shit there's a lot of good chinese food in the central square area.

if you want something a bit nicer but not crazy expensive, there's waypoint.  it's a pretty trendy-ish seafood place, but the food is actually really good.  speaking of seafood, my wife really likes the hourly for oysters.

asmara is really good eritrean food.  there used to be another ethiopian/eritrean restaurant nearby, towards porter, but now asmara is the only thing around.  i *love* that injera.  (also they serve raw beef!  yum!)  you can actually just buy homemade injera at shalimar ($5 last i checked, not recently), but they make you pay for the injera with cash because they sell it on behalf of the person who makes it.  no preservatives, so the injera sours pretty quickly.  that's why it's so fucking good.

monkfish (formerly thelonious monkfish) is pretty good.  i like it.  wife doesn't.  the sushi is overpriced, but the duck curry with lychee is awesome.

for japanese, this is a bit far, but go to wafu-ya in porter square.  i think it's less than 20 minutes from the science center.  they have great specials and a great menu.  though last i checked they were closed for ""renovations""... again.  maybe i'll walk over there this weekend and take a peek, because i can't get those specials to go at cafe sushi.  speaking of which, cafe sushi has *really* good specials, but you're going to need a reservation and a fuckton of cash because it's also expensive.  i did their omakase once, i think it was $85?  it's definitely not an everyday meal, but for once in a while, if you can afford it, it's worth it.  note that if you want stuff to go, you can't order their good stuff.

that's all i can think of within a 20-minute walk of harvard.  if you want to go 30 minutes, there's stuff in union square that's pretty good, like macchu picchu (get their alfajores, holy shit) and some, like, trendy places that i wouldn't know.  there's also a good restaurant scene in the south end, which is annoying to get to (you can take the 1, but it's more than 20 minutes, i think). good luck!"
1270,"i second alden & harlow. it's definitely the nicest classy restaurant in harvard square. that said, the prices are nuts. with the exception of the one time my friend and i rolled through and split their infamous burger, i only ever went there when other people were paying"

>not at all. because race still matters in american society, blacks and hispanics are disproportionately poor, and therefore disproportionately benefit from socioeconomic preferences. at the same time, the class-based approach recognizes that disadvantaged whites and asians deserve a leg up, too, and that privileged underrepresented minorities, such as former president barack obama’s daughters, do not.   
>  
>  
>  
>needs-based affirmative action makes sense to people. whereas only 24 percent supported using race as a factor in the wgbh poll, 58 percent said admissions officers should include “overcoming hardships such as poverty or health problems” as an admissions factor — more than supported considering leadership, or athletic or musical talent.

>extensive [research](https://tcf.org/content/report/future-of-affirmative-action/) finds that if colleges create a genuinely fair admissions system, which factors in economic obstacles students have had to overcome, then african-americans and latinos can succeed without racial preferences. new [research](http://samv91khoyt2i553a2t1s05i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/doc-416-1-kahlenberg-expert-report.pdf) my colleagues and i conducted as part of a lawsuit by students for fair admissions against harvard affirms these findings.

>we began by simulating what would happen if harvard eliminated the blatantly unfair obstacles that it throws in the path of disadvantaged students, such as the substantial preference provided to the privileged children of alumni and faculty children, and a back-door “z-list” admissions system that favors, among others, those who make it on to a special “dean’s interest” list. we then provided a preference to economically disadvantaged students that is about half the size of the leg up harvard currently gives to athletes. students of different races were treated equally.  
>  
>the result? the admission of african american and latino and other underrepresented minority students rose from 28 percent to 30 percent. meanwhile, the proportion of first-generation college students increased from 7 percent to 25 percent, a development that would surely make classrooms discussion more interesting at a university where in recent years, the number of high-income students has [outnumbered](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/papers/coll_mrc_paper.pdf) the number of low-income students by 23 to 1.

>  
>  
>  
>in reality, however, under socioeconomic preferences, the average high school grades of admitted students would be just as high as they are now, and sat scores would be at the 98th percentile.   
>  
>incredibly, officials at harvard also raised questions about whether the nation’s richest university could afford to provide financial aid under a system socioeconomic preferences. this was a surprising claim from an institution whose $37 billion endowment is larger than the gdp of half of the world’s countries. indeed, harvard’s own financial aid director testified that harvard would have no problem doubling the proportion of disadvantaged students eligible for financial aid programs.  
>  
>racial diversity on campus is important, especially in the age of donald trump, when our nation is so deeply divided. but there is a better, less divisive way to achieve the goal by opening the doors of elite universities to disadvantaged students of all races who are now largely shut out of elite higher education.

&#x200b;"
1272,"ses-based affirmative action has been a popular idea since the 80s. the problem with it is (1) harvard likes wealthy families, especially potential donors. it's hard to stay elite with a class filed with economically poor geniuses without family or business connections (2) harvard cares more about looking diverse than being diverse. (i.e., having a bunch of poor asian immigrants who worked at their family's small laundromat or restaurant after school isn't going to cull liberal racism about personality-less un-creative asian ""drones"")

"
1273,"exactly. the advantaged of going to a place like harvard is to rub shoulders with the elite, well-connected, and wealthy. if harvard became substantially low-income, it would lose that reputation. "
1274,there’s an institutional history of discrimination at harvard. it’s completely relevant to the case at hand.
1275,i’m not a fan. should be played in harvard’s stadium. 
1276,"but why 

edit: apparently its to accommodate renovations to harvard stadium, according to a [follow-up](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/12/1/students-react-fenway/) article. "
1277,"this is cool!

it's gonna be weird seeing my first game at home not actually being played in harvard stadium, however. "
1278,">is it possible harvard's decision to go ""self-administered"" with covid testing is a way to give plausible deniability to the campus?

no. the self-test kits are in everyone's interests. the self-test kits help the already busy students save time. it is also safer to not have clusters of students going to the same place to get tested, rather they can administer the test in their own room. moreover, having self-administered tests opens up harvard to more liability, not less.

>there will be a percentage of students that send back blank samples or don't follow the instructions well.

there will be ""a percentage,"" but there is no reason to believe that this percentage of students is higher than the percentage for missing test days or having inconclusive samples in a system without self testing. actually, since it is easier for students to complete the self test there is reason to believe that the percentage of bad/missed samples will be lower with self testing. also, students are promptly notified of bad/missed samples.

>harvard will drop off a 7-day supply kit to positive cases in the dorms, *and they recommend self-quarantine (unenforced honor system)*.

the latter part is of this statement is untrue. self-quarantine is not only recommended—enforcement is done by all officers of the university, securitas security, and the harvard university police department."
1279,honestly i'm shocked bu is providing tests but harvard has to self test.

1281,"no. well, maybe... if the moon landing was faked and the cia trained lee harvey oswald. 

there is no doubt there will be some imbeciles who think they can not bother or try to game it for some idiotic reason however this virus is so infectious and contagious that if one person has it, others will, and then there will be contract tracing performed and then a supervised testing will occur. 

the purpose of this testing is to keep the harvard community safe. if harvard can’t do that, everyone is going home, and nobody is coming in the spring."
1282,"? harvard is also providing tests....you just don't have to go to a testing location, and can instead swab your own nostrils in the comfort of your dorm (with the harvard-provided tests, obviously). and only if you're over 18 and had a few positive tests already."

at least they are thankful for the voluntary compliance. but this is very contingent on everyone doing exactly as instructed in the online self-administered testing protocol videos. and then being completely honest if they get some felipe's."
1284,"i guess that's what i meant, i'm surprised that harvard has to self report at all, considering how many more resources they have compared to the other schools. coulda been a little more careful with my **p h r a s i n g**"

1293,"but, at least they were ""woke"" to the real issues, right?

edit: this is sarcasm. the idea that you beat the shit out of anyone asking a civil question is beyond me. the fact it happened in a harvard alumn club makes me feel like dartmouth and princeton may have infiltrated their rogue agents to spread discord among our beloved institution's graduates.

edit 2: seriously, she asked how there can be peace in isreal when the palestineans are sending terrorists into the isreali populace. it's a valid question that should have been started with dialogue instead of kicking her ass and then booting her from the club.

edit 3: that professor,  faris mousa saah, should be censured for his conduct. how dare he call this woman a ""whore"".  in the us this isn't generally considered the occupation of educated women. i only assume he felt it was because of how his own mother accepted drachma's for bj's behind the ali-baba-waffle-madrasa.  i would use more colorful language, but it probably wouldn't be reddit-friendly."
1294,"here are some other articles to inform us more on what happened:   [https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/02/10/jewish-alumna-sues-harvard-club-after-instructor-allegedly-assaulted-insulted-her/](https://www.algemeiner.com/2020/02/10/jewish-alumna-sues-harvard-club-after-instructor-allegedly-assaulted-insulted-her/)

1295,"if it is truly private with no ties to harvard, then they are profiting off of the harvard brand. they should either cease using the name ""harvard club"" or pay the profits of all transactions where they invoke the harvard brand.

to me, this is the same as the klu klux klan creating an organization called ""harvard club"" and holding anti-semitic functions. either they should be held accountable or held to account."
1296,"not really. think about the facts:

an organization called ""harvard club"" held a seminar regarding relations in isreal, where a jewish woman asked about terrorism. she was beaten and expelled from the club.

that could have easily been a kkk headline. **prove me wrong.**"
1297,"from her perspective, she was right. from the club's perspective they were right. with both those perspectives in note, i agree more with her perspective than theirs.

if she stood on a table and screamed ""what about the hundreds of children who die every year from palestinean rockets?"" while defecating on a cake, i would still say she didn't deserve to have her face kicked-in. i would also say the club's inability to temper its own response is not aligned with harvard ethos (unless you have blue hair). 

fuck that club, it makes me ashamed to have attended this school."
1298,"all jokes aside, it kinda depends on what you mean. there's almost no one here who i would consider ""ordinary"" but very few people are amazing at everything. yes, you'll meet people who are absolute geniuses at math but they're still average or so at writing. or you'll meet athletes who are incredible at their sport but are still about average in an intro level course. and even so, these people with really excellent skills are more a loud minority than anything. ""average"" for harvard still does mean fairly smart, capable, and talented, but it doesn't mean you're some kind of prodigy. most of the people here are so down to earth that almost everyone feels normal to you, but many might just have a special knack for debate, hacking, etc."
1299,"just remember, some of the smartest (book smart) and most talented kids i met at harvard were also among the most stupid (street smart) and least talented (social iq) i’ve ever met anywhere."
1300,"i don’t believe that any of us have ever attended multiple ivies for undergrad, so we probably can’t make good objective comparisons. additionally, i believe that stem covers nearly a majority of harvard students, so it’s hard to say anything true about all stem majors. 


i would say that people at harvard are generally somewhat stressed, but that the stress is self-induced more than externally-induced. the kind of person who gets into harvard is correlated strongly with the kind of person who cares enough about their grades and extracurriculars to make some unhealthy decisions in order to meet their goals. on the other hand, i don’t think i’ve ever seen a professor try to force someone to focus more on their grades in a class, or to use work or grades for any reason other than to teach material as well as they can. 

tl;dr you’re the same person now as you will be if you attend harvard, and it’s unlikely your stress will be vastly different here than it is now."
1301,"the biggest surprise coming into harvard as a stem major for me is how incredibly supportive and collaborative all the stem courses i've been in are. there are physics nights / math nights / cs nights / applied math nights for collaborating on your psets, while they provide desserts/food. professors are always very supportive, directly hosting office hours in addition to tf/cas' office hours, and there's no visible, cutthroat competition in grades that my friends at other schools seem to have experienced (but again, i have not attended other universities, so i cannot compare). while the stem courses here are definitely extremely rigorous and challenging, a lot more than one might expect, the environment is supportive enough to make it not stressful for me."
1302,"i second the comment, “the kind of person who gets into harvard is correlated strongly with the kind of person who cares enough about their grades to make unhealthy decisions in order to meet their goals.”

the professors have been nothing but extraordinary and supportive; however, the caliber of student you compete with at harvard is also extraordinary. sometimes to keep up with them, i study 12 hours a day and forget to eat or talk to people and the consequences of that are my own fault, not that of the professors or school. 

i think it’s important to plan for your health: social, physical, and mental. it impacts your performance, but a lot of students don’t see it until it’s hard to fix."
1303,it’s important to remember that mediocre among harvard students is outstanding.
1304,"the competition can be fierce while you're there, especially as a freshman adjusting to college life. you will likely have to change your study habits from high school, depending on your coursework and extracurricular balance.

it may be useful to reach out to one of your house tutors, concentration advisor, or an upperclassman/paf. especially for the upperclassmen and pafs, they will give you real advice from their own (possibly similar experience).

as for grades, i wouldn't worry about it too much. unless you're gunning for a top consulting position or a top 10 med/law school, your grades don't matter as much as graduating from harvard. the name itself will carry a lot of weight post-grad. and things get easier post-grad, as you'll notice how rigorous your classwork and peer competition was compared to others. it can be difficult now, but definitely make sure to keep the big picture in mind and that exams and p-sets are only a small part of the harvard experience (and thus the benefits that the school can provide for you).

also, this phenomenon is far more common than you might think! harvard students are excellent at hiding their stress/struggles under and outward façade of tranquility."
1305,"hi student, i felt exactly the same way my freshman year. i felt like everyone around me knew what to say, how to ask questions, how to form relationships with professors, and how to study effectively. harvard has a culture that many students coming from andover and choate (#noteanoshade) are already familiar with. i came from a public school and did not learn these skills. 

as for studying (i was stem and can’t say much about humanities), i would study a lot by myself, but later realized i can cover a lot more studying as a group. i tried videos, notes, anki... the important skills are active recall and spaced repetition, but also using your peers as a way to make sure you’re covering your bases. 

set goals, meet nice people to work with. it’s better to struggle with friends than struggle alone. every thursday was an all-nighter with my friend as we furiously tried to finish the pset.

what made me feel more confident was to tell myself that i deserved a seat at the table. i deserved to be comfortable around professors and freely ask questions or just say “i really don’t understand this.” freshman year is hard! be honest, take this year to make your mistakes. good luck."
1306,"reposting some hopefully useful comments i gave to an earlier post about someone who was struggling after their first semester:

my first semester grades of freshman year (waaaaay back in 1999) were, my worst of all of college. i kept them pretty steadily climbing every semester after to where i had mostly as with one or two a- grades late junior and senior years. i got my overall gpa up to a pretty respectable level and have had great opportunities since college.

here's what i learned that most helped me:

1. let go of all but one or two extracurriculars that demand major time/effort commitments (more than, say, an hour per week). you can stay on email lists and keep up with the interesting parts of the others, but don't let yourself commit to stuff. you mentioned an initial goal to try all possible opportunities at harvard. in just four years a hundred people together couldn't take advantage of all harvard has to offer; trying will just run you ragged. now that you've had some time to explore probably just a small sampling of those opportunities, pick a few and focus on the quality of that experience for yourself and others. how do you pick which ones to keep? i suggest choosing ones where you a) really enjoy the activities, b) care about their purpose, and c) enjoy spending time with the people. for most of my friends years after graduation the most meaningful part of the extracurriculars is the friendships they developed. which groups do you want to nourish your friendships with most? if you've taken all those factors seriously and still have too many to choose from, then consider which will best help you develop skills for careers that interest you.
2. in terms of both classes and activities taken, try to balance your workload and pace yourself. two tough classes this semester? try to balance it out with some less challenging ones or scale back a bit on extracurriculars for a semester. you seem to have already diagnosed this issue so not too much to add here. just realize that if you've built a system that requires delicate balance, that also requires minimal disruption from outside forces. midterms, romantic relationships, family situations, roommate drama, illness, all kinds of other things can be big disruptive forces. if you don't have a bit of ""slack"" to handle those unexpected increases in stress it's easy to get into a downward spiral.
3. take advantage of office hours. this totally deserves its own point; i wish i had picked up on this my freshman year. your professors and tfs want you to succeed. they can often tell who's struggling but can't really come running to all of you. the easiest way for them to help is if you come to their office hours and get some help on part of a problem set that you're stuck on or when you're struggling with a topic on a paper. even if they seem standoffish in lectures they're often very personable and helpful one-on-one. go early, well before the deadlines, before you're panicking, before you've wasted a bunch of energy banging your head against the desk. don't ask for answers or special favors but do make it clear you want to understand the material and do well in the class. they can clear roadblocks, steer you in useful directions (e.g. ""that's not a very interesting paper topic but have you thought about this other angle on your idea?""), better signal what they care about in grading, and prevent so much wasted effort in your work. two other advantages: they'll better understand what some students (at least you) are struggling with and may be able to adjust their lectures to be more helpful for you. you'll also often build good relationships with them that yield other cool opportunities. in my junior year i regularly visited the professor's office hours for my thermodynamics class. i was not at the top of the class but at the end he asked me whether i'd like to be a tf the following year, which turned out to be a really awesome opportunity.
4. join or create study groups. again this prevents you wasting time banging your head against the desk when someone else in the group can quickly help you see something you were missing. it also reduces your feeling that you're alone in finding things difficult and will hopefully give you a chance to help others. helping others with their challenges often helped me learn the material better myself. in my time prof. morin had a thursday night study session in the leverett dining hall for his physics class. he and one of his tas would just be on hand for any questions. lots of other science and math profs did the same. about half the class showed up to work on problem sets together those evenings. whenever a bunch of us were stumped one of us went to the prof or ta for help to unblock us. working in those groups helped me a ton and i made some good friends at the same time.
5. get help early. meet with your proctor or freshman dean or whatever they have these days and tell them you had a tough semester and want to know what kinds of help is available going forward before you get into a panicked or bad situation. they will gladly open a ton of doors to people willing and eager to help you."
1307,">when i visited harvard, everyone seemed pretty stressed out. granted, it’s finals season so maybe that’s part of it. but when i asked people “are you happy at harvard?” nobody gave a straight yes.

i'd keep in mind that for most people the happiness is delayed.  everyone is working towards what comes after harvard/stanford...so in that sense it's ""hardwork"" until the pay off hits.  student happiness at most ivy's probably has more to do w/ the cities they are in and how easy it is to get off of campus and do something for themselves.  that said cambridge & boston, depending on where you're coming from, might not give you the happiness you're looking for."
1308,"i’ve been on both campuses as well. i even knew someone who attended harvard for a little while but did most of their undergrad at stanford. he seems a lot happier at stanford. being from the bay area, the weather makes a huge difference on your attitude in terms of depression. the sunnier environment with warm weather is ideal compared to the cold and rainy. 

i think you should go and see if you can visit them again (if you can afford that) and go check out all of the opportunities. are you the type of person who likes the rain? are you the type of person who wants to study outside and tan? look at the amenities and ask students who are walking around for their true opinion."
1309,"nice story
i also had to choose between harvard and stanford a few decade ago 
my gut feeling was to go to harvard because the name and reputation associated with harvard is on a league of its own
but i ended up going to stanford because it was closer to home (lived in south san francisco)
i set aside the harvard dream for grad school but didnt get in and eventually just went to berkeley"
1310,"this article talked a bit about his time at harvard per what he says in his biography: https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete?fbclid=iwar2mqosdzplr-sau-00jmmdnmnfym8jub5ap284jvoazee-fwqc56o_edia

mind i don’t see eye to eye on many things the author concludes (lol on his assessment of rhodes scholars from the ones i’ve met, for example), but i did find the harvard part interesting and a bit concerning."
1311,"thanks for the link.  i understand some of the author [nathan j robinson's](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/nathan-robinson) points, but much of the piece felt like it was digging for talking points to be critical.  for example, buttigieg has had privilege and many opportunities in life due to his upbringing that few people have.  at least he seems to have taken a better path than many people with similar opportunities take.  i'd say mckinsey is the least ""noble"" part of the path, but i can't automatically discount someone because of that.  i'm sure we all know decent people who have worked at these consulting firms.  i was also put off by what i perceived to a style in the piece of being critical because buttigieg did not express outrage about by x, y, z inequality.

i was not surprised to see that the author is a doctoral student, and, as is common at harvard, he founded his own publication, current affairs in 2015.  it's rated by [mediabiasfactcheck.com to be left biased](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/current-affairs-magazine/)."
1312,"that’s not surprising from the article. i first heard about it tho from a colleague who was a harvard contemporary of his if you’re interested, though i don’t think they knew each other: https://twitter.com/ibjiyongi/status/1111977518872051712?s=21"

1314,"that's a great story - i'm glad that you found your footing (that is, after all, a large part of what undergraduate years are all about...)

your story and your fellow redditor's story, when taken side by side, just go to show that there is no *one* harvard. one's experience of it can be as different from another's, as one person is different from another. but there's something special about it, that's for sure! just what that is, is hard to define with anything resembling precision."
1315,"here's hoping - i took a year off of harvard this year, and i can't fucking wait to be back in 2017."
1316,"this happened to me in my first year at harvard (1999) and i'm sure it happens to lots of others too. you're not alone in this experience. my first semester grades of freshman year were, i think, my worst of all of college. i kept them pretty steadily climbing every semester after to where i had mostly as with one or two a- grades late junior and senior years. i got my overall gpa up to a pretty respectable level and have had great opportunities since college. things can get better for you too. here's what i learned that most helped me:

1. i agree with shoogenboogen's suggestion to let go of all but one or two extracurriculars that demand major time/effort commitments (more than, say, an hour per week). you can stay on email lists and keep up with the interesting parts of the others, but don't let yourself commit to stuff. you mentioned an initial goal to try all possible opportunities at harvard. in just four years a hundred people together couldn't take advantage of all harvard has to offer; trying will just run you ragged. now that you've had some time to explore probably just a small sampling of those opportunities, pick a few and focus on the quality of that experience for yourself and others. how do you pick which ones to keep? i suggest choosing ones where you a) really enjoy the activities, b) care about their purpose, and c) enjoy spending time with the people. for most of my friends years after graduation the most meaningful part of the extracurriculars is the friendships they developed. which groups do you want to nourish your friendships with most? if you've taken all those factors seriously and still have too many to choose from, then consider which will best help you develop skills for careers that interest you.

3. take advantage of office hours. this totally deserves its own point; i wish i had picked up on this my freshman year. your professors and tfs want you to succeed. they can often tell who's struggling but can't really come running to all of you. the easiest way for them to help is if you come to their office hours and get some help on part of a problem set that you're stuck on or when you're struggling with a topic on a paper. even if they seem standoffish in lectures they're often very personable and helpful one-on-one. go early, well before the deadlines, before you're panicking, before you've wasted a bunch of energy banging your head against the desk. don't ask for answers or special favors but do make it clear you want to understand the material and do well in the class. they can clear roadblocks, steer you in useful directions (e.g. ""that's not a very interesting paper topic but have you thought about this other angle on your idea?""), better signal what they care about in grading, and prevent so much wasted effort in your work. two other advantages: they'll better understand what some students (at least you) are struggling with and may be able to adjust their lectures to be more helpful for you. you'll also often build good relationships with them that yield other cool opportunities. in my junior year i regularly visited the professor's office hours for my thermodynamics class. i was not at the top of the class but at the end he asked me whether i'd like to be a tf the following year, which turned out to be a really awesome opportunity.

1317,"this is really common. harvard is a tough adjustment, especially if you are used to gliding through school.

pretty sure everybody had a tough first semester! make sure to take full advantage of all of the help that harvard offers."
1318,"i used to be the pre-careers tutor in one of the houses - a huge number of students feel this way. and i did too, as a student, which is specifically why i went back and became a tutor. what’s happening is not that your options are narrowing, it’s that those fields you mention (plus academia, law school, and maybe teaching) attract the most harvard students due to a combination of prestige, compensation, interestingness, ability to keep your options open for later career changes, and simply the amount of money those companies can afford to spend on showing up to harvard recruiting events. some of those reasons are valid and some totally suck. but the real world of options is very broad!  

so here’s what you should do as a sophomore and beyond.  a 3-pronged strategy, all related:

1. test career hypotheses. think about what fits in the center of the venn diagram between what you like and what you’re good at, and keep pursing it and gaining expertise and trying it out. could be lots of different things. form a hypothesis based on your interests and skills, like “maybe i would like doing x because i enjoy team environments and engineering puzzles,” and figure out ways to test it experimentally: through a project, a class, an internship, even an informational interview with an alumnus (try emailing them with a really short “can we have a call” email, you’ll get a really high response rate compared to cold emails out in the world!) or shadowing them for a day. etc. different experiments have different levels of fidelity and that’s ok. as long as you’re learning, you’re making progress!

2. proactively learn more about what’s out there, to counteract the “ocs effect” you’re currently experiencing. this can happen naturally through #1 but it’s also good to do things like: look through the alumni database in no particular order, to get a sense of what alumni’s actual distribution of jobs are. read the ocs data on that and look through the diverse long tail of career paths that aren’t the big 5 or whatever, and dig in on what some of them are. get an alumnus to lend you their 5- or 10-year reunion red book with classmates’ updates to each other on what their life has been like since graduation. 

3. actively open yourself up to serendipity. this sounds goofy but in reality a large fraction of job offers come through luck rather than the standard codified processes. create that luck by: going up to talk to your professor after class when there’s something that piques your interest. signing up for the clubs and email lists for both harvard and mit or other local schools on subjects you’re interested in, and when an event catches your eye, show up, and engage with the speaker afterwards in person. (post-covid of course). submit to the mind-numbing haystack that is career fairs - just go, and read through the lists of companies, because you only need one to catch your eye and work out, even if it means going through hundreds. get out of your room, and say yes to things and see where they take you. 

there’s no one blueprint for finding a good job match, and you really wouldn’t want there to be. this is how you can deal with that!"
1319,"i work in a pharmaceutical company that actually has a lot of harvard talent. most have grad degrees but if your looking for someplace to start and see if you like it, reach out and we can chat! it’s not just research in a lab. there’s a lot of other things that go into bringing a drug to the market."
1320,"don't give up a $60k per semester learning experience for an hourly wage. you'll always have time to get a shitty job, you will never get another opportunity to get a good education like you have with harvard right now.

  


whoever is pushing you to get a job either has no concept of the opportunity you have or understand and want you to suffer for your process. either way, fuck them. stand up for yourself and focus on the studies. money will come easily when you graduate"
1321,i second this.  i spent way too much time at harvard working to pay for my time at harvard.
1322,"i'm really sorry for all this weirdness coming from my country. frankly i've noticed many filipinos lack basic social media etiquette. some of the replies are just plain rude towards actual harvard students who commented. 

i'm curious though, has this caught the attention of the univ admin? what are the students saying about this lol"
1323,"he was insinuating that it was a harvard professor who failed him, most of the comments are made up lmao"
1324,"with the exception of about five legacies whose families have been attending harvard in an unbroken string since harvard was founded, everyone has imposter syndrome at harvard for at least some period of time.  that's doubly true for those, like me, who came to harvard without the typical elite credentials.

the reality is that virtually no one, with the exception of a prodigy or two, *deserves* to be at harvard.  any harvard program probably could refill its ranks multiple times over without sacrificing quality.

the one thing i regret is that when i first got to harvard, i was so grateful to be there that i was perfectly happy with whatever i got.  like, i'd get a b+ and feel so grateful because i didn't deserve to be there anyways and couldn't possibly compete with my classmates with their elite high schools and ib programs.  well, that was bs; i could compete with them and once i started working a little harder i was able to get to a place where i was very happy with my performance."
1325,"i've said this before in this subreddit, but it bears repeating. everyone at harvard feels impostor syndrome for various reasons.

it only means you belong!

that said this semester will be uniquely challenging for everyone. view it as a learning experience, as a chance for potential growth. allow yourself to become a different, better person if you feel the need to. 

everyone's putting on a show, it's alright. just try to help other people on their journies and it will help you with yours."
1326,"no advice besides fake it till you make it, but take comfort in knowing that you're nowhere near alone in this. if i had to guess, 75% of harvard students feel this way, at least at one time or another."
1327,"that's a commonly expressed sentiment. i don't know if this is helpful but there's kind of a formula to getting into a school like harvard and if your profile fits, it fits. no need to feel like an imposter when your acceptance is proof that you are one of the students they are looking for. 
which grad school are you enrolling in?"
1328,"thanks. 
i see you posted something similar last year. 

i certainly don’t feel deserving to attend harvard. it’ll help once classes start and i get to talk with my classmates."
1329,"therapy has helped me immensely in this area. some days it really is just her saying to me ""what the hell are you talking about, you went to harvard. stop it."""
1330,"if we could read minds of most people on campus - most of them would be looking at *you*, as well - jealous that *you* look like you have it all together, that *you* know you belong and *you* know your stuff.

reality is...you both know your stuff. and you both are just nervous and humble.

most of us at harvard and many other schools feel the same thing time and time again. we all live in our heads and it's hard to see that what we feel is something a lot of others struggle with.

this is normal. talk to your classmates and make friends - and you may find that you're not alone.

you're at harvard for a reason - they don't bring in slouches. own dat shit, rock star!"
1331,"you don't need to do anything else. since you opted-in to financial aid on your application, you're good to go, and the aid will be applied to your term bill once the semester is under way (assuming it currently shows up as anticipated aid in my.harvard)."
1332,"the majority of the cabot science library (except where the actual library bit is, past the turnstile), the transept of memorial hall, many of the classroom buildings like philosophy and sever, some of the hls buildings, and most of the smith campus center are all accessible (meaning they don’t require swipe access) to the public. hls (i forget what building) has a nice fireplace lounge with some comfortable seating near the lobby. cabot also has a cafe with seating.

keep in mind though that most of them have signs requesting the public to stay out. if you do slip in, be respectful of those members of the harvard community who are actually using these spaces for scholarship and fellowship. you won’t be able to get in the actual libraries or houses unless you get a random student to swipe you in as a guest."
1333,"the cambridge public library near harvard yard and the highschool is the best public building/library in the whole city. free wifi, very clean, private rooms for work and phone calls, and very beautiful to look at the huge glass building/castle"
1334,"i would say this isn't the majority. it lies heavily in the fact that students reviews are (unfortunately) a major component of performance reviews for teachers trying to be promoted. how heavily teaching reviews are weighted seems to be an aspect unique to harvard, as most schools don't weigh them heavily, for good reasons. students are rarely good reviewers, with the majority coming from extremes - students who loved the class and/or got good grades and those who hated the class and/or got bad grades. so, professors have a large, implicit incentive to give good grades, to get good reviews, to get promotions. this is all irrespective of teaching ability."
1335,"it is in the premed chem classes. but i was a chem concentrator. so i took the chem for chemists classes. and no, a/a- is not the median in those classes. 

(if that was confusing, harvard used to offer two separate chemistry tracks for organic chemistry: chem 20 and chem 30 and chem 17 and chem 27.  the former was more in-depth and intended for chemistry concentrators. among chem students, they were viewed as the harder more legit classes. 17/27 had a stronger focus on biochem and was intended for premed students. both are fine options, but if you plan to concentrate in chemistry, take 20/30. and as a final note, i was a student there almost 10 years ago, so i have no idea if they chem department still does this or not.)"
1336,">students reviews are (unfortunately) a major component of performance reviews for teachers

really? i've heard that tenure review boards at harvard put very low weight on everything teaching-related. i've heard a number of faculty complain that they put tons of effort into pedagogy and get zero points for it among their colleagues, and that this is why harvard (at least the college) has a reputation for distant professors.

totally agree that student evals should not be overused in performance review, though. what little research has been done on them there is shows that there's very poor or even negative correlation between a teacher's eval scores and their ability to prepare students to succeed in subsequent related courses, but there's a big penalty for female and minority faculty that doesn't correlate with actual performance."
1337,"first, you're right that it's about money, but not the way you think you are. doing basic research outside of academia is almost impossible, since companies want to find research that will result in a product. it is definitely more profitable if you do applied research to go find some well funded company to give you a lab. but for everyone else, academia is really the only place for us. which sucks.

secondly, it's not all about the money. honestly, i love teaching but academic research doesn't seem to be how i want to spend my life. knowing that i will most likely leave academia one day, i already miss it. the community, the discussions, the collaborations. if i could find a way to stay in academia, teach, and not have to apply for grants, i'd take it in a heartbeat. 

lastly, teaching is a skill. whenever you start something new, even with training, you suck. but some academics don't get training to teach at all - they get training to do research. think about that for a second. trying to do a job you weren't trained for, knowing you'll get dragged across the coals. it's daunting and hellish. harvard is fantastic and we have the bok, but even still, it's a long learning curve to being a good teacher. don't judge someone too harshly for being youngish and being a bad teacher. emeritus old? go for it. they just don't care at this point, either about teaching or caring to improve themselves. but for everyone else? help them improve, rather than hating them for being bad, because honest and thoughtful feedback from students (rare, but not imaginary) is one of the few things that makes the learning curve easier."
1338,"i have heard that in certain institutions, quality teaching actually hurt your opportunities for tenure (for identity issues i will not say more except that perhaps at the time harvard was implied to be one of these institutions). that and i have also heard that the field i concentrated in does not have any tenure track positions: you pretty much had (have?) to get famous somewhere else first and then be hired as a tenured prof"
1339,"hey i'm no psych expert, but you're at harvard. people talked shit about zuckerberg, conan and a few other geniuses. seriously, you'll take time to find your niche at harvard, but when you do, you wouldn't wish anything else. i wish you best of luck and remember, that you're roommates are probably gonna end up at a lame corporate sellout job while you'll probably own the world"
1340,"it’s harvard, relax. no matter what you’re good in 48 months tops. your roommate may suck, but you’re both going to crush the average person you went to high school with - learn to deal or hit back."
1341,"listen, you probably live with three spoon fed dildos for classmates. that’s kind of life at school, easily half the school are a bunch of beta silverspoon cucks, who have dad’s that live to gossip at their country clubs. that’s par for the course at any harvard school. 

if you were a loser, you’d be at a junior college getting lung disease from juul. i know it sucks now, but when you’re done with the next few years - you’ll look back and brush this shit off. nerds rule the world and turn into gentlemen - go look up the last 25 most expensive home sales in la. a third are harvard alum getting sucked off by 22 year old actresses - gender agnostic on both ends. 

you’ve got this - keep your head up and fuck them!"

1346,"nah just surrounded by soon-to-be biglawyers. to be fair, i'm probably looking at the worst harvard has to offer. lol i was pretty bitter this morning apparently
"
1347,not really. look into something called public school. it's a lot better than how most harvard folk i've met make it out to be. 
1348,"it's really unfortunate that harvard, by virtue of its prominence, attracts a certain unsavory element to public fora like this one. 

some people take their political viewpoints, identify the university as somewhere in relation to those viewpoints (even though in reality the university is a really heterogeneous place with people all across the spectrum), and then attack using this subreddit as a proxy because they can hide under the safe anonymity of the internet.

or, worse, when someone *has* no actual viewpoint but just wants to lash out at a group they deem unfairly privileged or whatever, they come here.

either way, the relative anonymity of the internet is perfect for these cowardly types - they get all the ""benefit"" of being able to poke at people with none of the accountability that would come from being identifiable. i wonder how many of these jokers would say the kinds of things said here were they in person. i think the answer is: not many."
1349,"i'm really glad to hear your policy about removing posts. sometimes i disagree with harvard's policies and actions, but they've always been good, at least from what i've seen, about not censoring those who disagree with them. i'm glad to see this sub reflect the same values."
1350,not every country has/can afford strict vaccination programs. given the number of international students at harvard i'm not too surprised that weird diseases crop up from time to time. mumps was terrifying though
1351,"i am an international student. when i was accepted at harvard two years ago, i received a fairly extensive list of vaccines and a physical exam i had to undergo before i could complete my registration (and of course i needed a physician to get some paperwork done to prove it). it's the same with all the international students. if you can't afford them in your own country, i guess huhs would allow you to get vaccinated by them.

in the case you can't get vaccinated because of your religious beliefs, or because of a medical condition, then huhs may ask you to leave the campus in case of an outbreak. "
1352,"i think a lot of people experience this (myself included). the swan metaphor comes to mind here for me. on the surface, a swan gracefully glides on the water, but beneath the water is turbulence from his feet, it just can't be seen. other swans only see the graceful gliding of their counterparts and not the struggles beneath the water. at many top universities, harvard especially, this describes probably 80% of the population: everyone looks so well put-together and successful, but beneath that thin layer everyone struggles with similar turmoils and feelings. its easy to convince yourself that you're alone, but i assure you, you are not. "
1353,"yep i've gone around feeling like i was the outsider for never being particularly happy at harvard. ('12, stem, lev). i definitely regret a lot about the way i organized my time, what my priorities were, and especially the fact that i felt like i had a lot of ""friends"" but no one really close for actual support when i needed it.

i've tried to figure out if it was me or the harvard culture as a whole, but mostly i just don't worry about it. maybe college wasn't the idyllic dream i wanted, but i've moved on and am much happier now and trying to make the most of what's in front of me instead of wishing for a better past. (fwiw, i've found the west coast culture is *way* more suited to my personality.) you'll have plenty of opportunities to make your life what you want.

and yeah, the imposter syndrome at harvard is very real, but you leave the bubble and get into the real world and realize that you're so much better prepared than just about everyone else. even if i graduated feeling like i couldn't tell you what i learned, it still turned out to be quite a lot. also, the mental health thing is legit, and maybe worth looking into, especially if you've settled into your new job for a couple months and don't feel much better. don't be afraid of asking for help, i promise life gets easier when you do.

also you (or anyone else) can pm me if you want to talk more."
1354,a bad harvard gpa is actually exactly what business schools are looking for. 
1355,"everyone graduates college with some regrets. i've had a couple conversations with friends entirely about classes we regretted taking/ not taking. main regret is that i didn't stick with premed. i don't regret learning the material, but i'm in a job that rarely uses most of what i learned.

>i'll graduate with a 3.3, which by harvard standards is pretty shitty (correct me if i'm wrong).

per [here](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2013/12/9/stats-grade-inflation/), gpa has a mean of 3.6 and std dev of 0.5. going by the cdf [here](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=normal+distribution+mean+3.6+standard+deviation+0.5), about 70% of people had a higher gpa than 3.3. your gpa's not *that* below harvard average, and i know people who i know for a fact had worse gpas than you who are doing *very* well.

>in retrospect, i should've sought out mental health services but with two months left, i don't know how effective it'd be.

it's worth trying, but might be hard to get an appointment. i had mixed experiences with mental health services. for example, my gpa took a nosedive after my psychiatrist accidentally halved the adhd med dose i'd previously been on. i did get great help with depression, though."
1356,"you have a harvard degree, that is an amazing piece of currency.

remember, no one ever got fired for hiring a harvard grad."
1357,"non-harvard grad here. i always thought that harvard was absolute bs, especially when they keep churning out lib-cucks. the only people who benefit from harvard prestige is harvard. it's a marketing scheme where harvard grads pay $150,000 for someone else to tell them they are okay.

gpa doesn't matter. after college it will be just like the sat."
1358,"thank you so much for sharing; it means a lot to know that i'm not alone or abnormal for feeling the way i do.

> i've moved on and am much happier now and trying to make the most of what's in front of me instead of wishing for a better past.

i hope to do the same and am very glad that you've found your footing after harvard."
1359,all the work you did you either did alone or in groups that you turned in for a proctor to review and give you feedback including a grade. your education doesn't end at commencement. you can use your huid to access basically every single course harvard offers. find the ones that interest you. download the class materials. learn. you don't need a teacher to learn. be the autodidact that you were when you were revising a paper at 3am alone. you don't need the professor holding your hand anymore. http://ocw.mit.edu is another great resource. study what interests you. network. networking doesn't only happen at harvard. make sure you spend time on your linkedin profile.
1360,"came into harvard thinking i was going to be an engineer but quickly realized it wasn’t going to be for me and i moved into econ, which was completely new to me in terms of my high school course load. my experience was that econ was very doable regarding of the difficulty and course load of all my classes, but my friends who took cs definitely had a ton of difficult work. with that being said, it was also my impression that if you get into harvard you are almost certainly capable of studying anything you really want to try. one of my favorite things about the school was not deciding my concentration until the sophomore year."
1361,"this is a really good question. i say, like in all situations, it depends on your background and what you're trying to break into. generally, i think that it is easier, logistically, to explore new things at harvard than at most other schools. most concentrations don't have too many requirements, so you have lots of room in your schedule to take electives in new fields and explore a lot during freshman and sophomore year. additionally, so many people end up switching concentrations, and this tends to be easy at harvard because as long as you can show that you have the prereqs, time, and room to satisfy a concentration's requirements, you can switch (whereas many other places will make you formally transfer departments in a selective application process). hell, i know someone who switched their concentration senior fall. 

however, i still think exploration and switching around is, in many ways, actually more difficult at harvard. some fields more than others, particularly math and cs, benefit very much from early exposure and practice no matter where you go. when you combine this with the fact that at harvard, you're likely to find those who were some of the *best in the world* at those fields in high school, it can feel demoralizing when you first begin your journey. then additionally combine this with the fact that courses at harvard tend to be more rigorous than those at lower ranked schools. this can make things pretty difficult. for example, i was super into physics in high school, but when i came here, i started to grow interest in electrical eng and cs. i felt soooo stupid all the time in those classes (i already felt dumb enough in physics anyway). i don't think i was actually dumber than the average ee or cs student, i just had less experience and was taking classes that were already difficult on their own with people who lived and breathed this stuff in high school and during their whole time in college.

this definitely tends to more pronounced in hard stem fields, really. i think it's a lot easier to explore interests in the social sciences or humanities with a stem background than vice versa. it's not uncommon to find someone who later gets dissuaded from hard stem and claim they took ""the easy way out"" by switching to econ or gov. of course i am not at all saying those are necessarily easy fields but that there are many more easy ways to do econ or gov versus ""easy"" ways to do cs or physics or math etc (but there are still super hard ways to study econ).

conversely, you'll be hard pressed to find someone who, after mostly studying a social science or humanities field, ends up getting a math degree or related. it's not that they weren't capable of studying math, but math more so than i think every other field really benefits from early exposure (most math concentrators start with math 25, and if you're not at that level freshman year, it can be hard to get there later on). and personally, when i think about how much i've struggled with my physics degree at harvard, even after winning awards and doing research starting in high school, i can't even imagine what it must be like to experience physics for the first time at harvard. more than just pure content, the style of thinking necessary in stem fields and your mathematical maturity is something that you slowly develop over time.

this does suck, but i think it's good to understand early on that the barriers surrounding certain fields of study are higher than others. knowing this, you're better able to manage expectations of your performance when you will inevitably encounter challenges and come across people whose abilities blow your mind. and as a prefrosh, you are at the position where it is easiest to jump around and explore other fields of interest, but this gets much harder to do with each year that passes by in college. i still ended up getting a cs secondary, and funny enough i feel even though cs is one of those aforementioned fields, so many people at harvard end up switching to it anyway. if you think you want to explore cs and econ at harvard but you don't have experience in them, it doesn't hurt to dabble in that right now and do some early prep. for cs and more quantitative econ, it's really important to improve your mathematical skills, so work on that, too. 

edit: just to add more personal examples to my already excessively long comment: throughout my years, i've taken super interesting upper level electives in history, econ, gov, and english and didn't feel like my academic background held me back (i.e. i did not need to complete whatever standard intro sequence exists for those concentrations). but i can't imagine a history concentrator jumping into, say, upper level electrodynamics, without having the years of physics background."
1362,i was a pre-med (and even way longer than starting harvard). i now work in strat/ops/product for a tech company less than 3 years after graduating 🤷🏻‍♂️
1363,"freshman year to sophomore fall tends to be a big leap in terms of workload. taking four stem/ec classes plus a language class sounds like it could be overwhelming. at the very least (unless you pset more efficiently than 95% of harvard students) you'll probably have little time for fun and extracurriculars. frankly, i would hesitate to take those four classes together, even without a fifth class. cs121 and stat110 are notoriously hit-or-miss: lots of people struggle a lot with the material, though some people with more experience in theoretical cs/discrete math/probability get by just fine. ultimately, only you know your abilities. if you're unsure about it, you can try that schedule (or something like it) until add/drop, and see if it works for you. in general, i would say there are plenty of ways at harvard to challenge yourself without completely killing yourself. hope that helps!"
1364,a guy with a graduate degree in harvard
1365,was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/harvard/comments/e1qjjy/some_of_the_buildings_on_campus_this_week_were/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) a threat?/s
1366,"i’m 72 with a white beard. i accompanied another white bearded friend from mit who’d been quietly auditing a harvard extension ( the night school which does not have competitive admission) course all term. i thought he had permission ( he didn’t) so i felt free to make a comment and to talk to the professor afterwards. he asked us somewhat aggressively for harvard id, and when it transpired that neither of us had one, the professor said outside auditors were forbidden by policy. 

this same friend had audited a number of language courses in harvard college and the grad school with no problems usually, but somet he was asked to leave. 

i guess the moral of the story is to try to keep a low profile if you audit. 

as a tip, extension courses are very watered down and not usually worth the time to visit, but courses in other parts of the university, and academic talks by professors ( usually with the public welcome) are excellent. 

for public academic talks google the “harvard events calendar,” and other specialized calendars linked to it.  mit also has a lot on offer and a similar events calendar, and tufts, particularly the fletcher school of law and diplomacy if your interests run in that direction, also offers fewer, but worthwhile events."
1367,"register your bike with harvard police:

https://www.hupd.harvard.edu/bicycle-registration

also research and purchase a good lock. i have a u-lock + cable.  even the look of the double lock is enough to deter a bike thief to move to the next less-secured bike."
1368,yeah. harvard students get like 80% off the annual membership. and they are out 365 days in cambridge.
1369,"i think i could've used the mindset that every semester is a new start. unlike high school, you almost certainly will not do the same extracurricular (or have the same friend groups) for all four years, so keep trying new things and meeting new people but stay ready to quit. some of my wisest friends have called themselves ""very pro-quitting,"" and i think they're right.

not to self-pub, but i think the rest of [this column](https://www.thecrimson.com/column/after-the-fact/article/2018/11/19/levin-asking-the-right-questions/) is pretty solid first-year advice, too—i wrote it with your question in mind.

other miscellany: go abroad, go abroad, go abroad. do things you know you'd kick yourself if you didn't do, even if it means risking failing. as many have said, take easy classes your first semester. don't get super drunk more than a couple times a semester. actually reach out to people you want to befriend (offering specific mealtimes and locations is a good idea). don't stress too much about post-graduation stuff. do the corny stuff like entryway study breaks and hoco and generally try to meet the people harvard pseudo-randomly puts you in proximity of.

and one general one for freshman year: it just matters so much less than it feels like it does. my harvard experience (socially and academically) basically started sophomore year and it was fine! relax."
1370,"“he also testified about the letters harvard sends to high-school students in sparse country who have p.s.a.t. scores of at least 1310, encouraging them to apply. the only sparse country students with such scores who do not get the letter are asians; to receive it, an asian male must score at least 1380.”

yep that sounds pretty discriminatory to me."
1371,"lets be honest.. a white kid or an asian kid with a 1380 on psats is not going to get into harvard anyhow.. its in poor taste to have done this, but that's no where near the floor for admissions anyhow, so its not binding. "
1372,this is harvard. we have enough money.
1373,"i would do it again, no question. harvard has its flaws, but they are relatively minor compared to the unparalleled amount of resources, classes, and opportunities that it affords. i also, personally, really enjoyed being a part of the many old traditions and my house. 

also, i would have likely gone into debt had i attended any of the other universities i was considering.  "
1374,"graduated in 2012. i was a bit disillusioned after freshman fall, and i seriously considered transferring. i visited swarthmore.

i'm glad i took the option of tranferring so seriously, because it made me realize that harvard, for all its flaws/annoyances, is significantly better than the alternatives. that is, i wasn't super happy at harvard, but i would have been less happy at other places. 

swarthmore, by comparison, felt rinky dink. sure, you got more attention, but the course quality and range of options couldn't compare. the students were just as annoying as harvard students. there was simply so much more opportunity at a place like harvard.

i'm now a phd student at berkeley and after getting to know the berkeley undergrad experience, i'm now even more appreciative of my harvard experience. 

without knowing much about the relevant alternatives, it's easy to imagine that you'd be happier somewhere else. but harvard really is a special place--special in ways that are hard to appreciate while you're there."
1375,"if i had it to do over, i would have come to harvard *sooner* - there's just so many great opportunities there, and since i have family obligations, etc., it's harder for me to take advantage of them. so i've contented myself to just do the best i can and be happy for the opportunities i've got (which have been and are plentiful)."
1376,"i am a teen from sri lanka, and i have been working on the ""harvard versus whorehouse"" project.

here is a response from someone i know who studied at harvard. please don't dismiss the comments as incorrect just because you disagree with that person.

""harvard has a high proportion of white people - much higher than what other schools like stanford and berkeley have. this is because of legacy preferences in harvard admissions.

white people have it easier at harvard. this is because the system is set up that way.

please don't get annoyed with this comment just because you are a white person.
* if you are a white person and have never experienced racism at harvard, please don't argue with me about whether other people have experienced racism. 
* if you are a white person and have experienced racism, that is also possible. but , in many ways, harvard can be a very hostile environment for non-whites."""
1377,"yes, i would choose to attend harvard again.  it was a great environment for me to grow intellectually and personally.  i value the consistently talented, diverse, and driven group of people who were part of the community."
1378,"princeton sucks too. 

white people: instead of saying that mexicans have large families, maybe you should say that *you* have small families. there is this idiotic concept called a ""nuclear family"", which is supposed to be some sort of american ideal.

update: please note that i don't mean any harm when i talk about ""white people"". but the whole concept of families more than two people being a large family and mexicans being made fun of for that makes no sense. most surveys of family sizes in hunter-gatherer cultures reveal family sizes far greater than two.

also, i don't know where harvard researchers get their data from. take steven pinker, for example. steven pinker says that the world has gotten more peaceful. maybe for white people. but really, as compared to what? 

if you compare the 21st century to the following centuries, the following results would be seen:

(*) 21st century versus 19th century: zero chance of a nuclear holocaust, zero chance of entire regions being flooded due to global warming.
(*) 21st century versus 18th century: zero chance of a nuclear holocaust, zero chance of entire regions being flooded due to global warming.
(*) 21st century versus 17th century: zero chance of a nuclear holocaust, zero chance of entire regions being flooded due to global warming.
(*) 21st century versus 16th century: zero chance of a nuclear holocaust, zero chance of entire regions being flooded due to global warming.
(*) 21st century versus 15th century: zero chance of a nuclear holocaust, zero chance of entire regions being flooded due to global warming.

do you need more data? i have 14 more centuries for ya."
1379,"college made me realize that seasonal depression is a very real thing that can profoundly affect one's student experience. as a dumbass 18-year-old who commuted like 1 suburban mile to & from high school, nothing prepared me for the morbid realities of seasonal affective disorder once one escapes suburbia.

i will never, ever knock somebody for choosing a less-highly-ranked university in a location that makes one happier & healthier, especially because of stupid chemical imbalances. and stanford isn't even arbitrarily ranked below us!

that said: harvard is probably a way different experience for people that don't mind cold weather one bit. still worth it for me, however!"

1381,oh god. explaining what the extension school is becomes extremely mundane after a while. but it's still better to be upfront than just say harvard university imo.
1382,"i'm mexican but white-passing, so i can't comment extensively on racism here. but, empirically, harvard is less white than the us population as a whole. less then half of our students are white. "

1385,"hes is just as much a part of harvard university as any other division is. if someone asks me quickly, i say i'm an undergraduate of the university, but i never want to deceive people into thinking that i'm a student at the college."

i am sending a comment your way because, sometimes, i cannot believe that people don't understand that the dangers of nuclear technology are a 21st century thing. how could harvard's steven pinker not know that?"
1387,i was having dinner with the legendary michael shinagel--the longest-serving dean in harvard history--and he raised an awesome toast to some of hes's graduates. one who stuck out was a girl raised in an abusive homeschooling/*no-schooling* cult who broke out and earned her bachelor's at the age of 14; he said it's all about students like her. damn straight. 
1388,"fair enough. it just seems like most people don't know the difference between harvard college and harvard university. they just see it as harvard.

so i default to hes to avoid the perception that i was some bright valedictorian or whatever."
1389,"not quite. publically available data (on the university websites) would tell you that stanford is about 46% white, while harvard is 49% white. not a major difference, i'd posit. berkeley is less white, but also less diverse (it's plurality asian), because the school is legally prohibited by the state of california from practicing affirmative action. berkeley does not even nearly represent the demographics of the population of california. harvard has many issues, including issues of diversity (esp. economic diversity) and racism, but the school is definitely racially diverse."
1390,"the harvard division of continuing education:   
imposter syndrome hell, selection bias heaven"
1391,"heck, yeah. probably. i am just a teen from sri lanka. i may not know all about the demographics of harvard versus stanford. i know only a little.

but i can tell you this.

(1) stanford has a very friendly campus. it is not at all like harvard.
(2) berkeley has a very, very diverse campus. with lots of asians. asians are, in general, considered ""outsiders"" in america. they are not likely to be labelling virtually everyone non-white as ""having large families"", ""not being able to read"", et cetera.
(3) another thing is that harvard is in the boston area. boston is far more white than the bay area.
(4) much better to compare harvard to big ten universities. those campuses are just *much* more chilled out. harvard is snooty. harvard is full of rich kids. who act like assholes whenever they can. that is harvard for you.

pound for pound, harvard people are just much more prone to assholery than any other school. you sense it as soon as you get out of the harvard mbta station.

worst. assholes. ever.

edit: one of these dudes goes on and on about how i would ""never go into harvard"" and other stuff and nonsense about this whole thing. i don't know how this dude knows whether or not i or the other commenters here ever got into harvard. trust me. there is a lot about us you don't know."
1392,"people who attend harvard always let you know that they attended harvard. never seen a place so obsessed with its own self-importance.

1394,"i wonder how much of this ""harvard advantage"" can be attributed to increased writer synergy between multiple harvard alumnus. how does a show's average rating compare when it had just one harvard writer vs. multiple writers from harvard? 

if there is a positive effect when multiple writers have all attended harvard, will there be a similar effect for other schools?"

1396,"this is an interesting point. i think it's impossible to compare harvard synergy to other schools' synergy, because afaik harvard's the only school that two or more co-writers have actually attended. the single-writer vs. multi-writer thing could be studied, however."

1401,"penn state offers a similar program. they call it “world campus”. you take the same exact courses as students would take on campus, although yours would be online exclusively. 

obviously you’re limited to what courses you can take. you won’t be able to set up a chem lab in your 1br apartment. 

i say keep it “harvard extension school”. i would be proud to sit next to someone at graduation who took the hes route. they probably have a full time job, children at home, or maybe a veteran. it’s not like hes programs are any easier than on-campus courses."
1402,"i’m a current extension school student and damn proud!

we still have to put in the work to be admitted as degree seeking students. arguably, the idea of having to commit to a semester or two of classes to prove ourselves would turn a lot of people off from applying. in the end, we still get a harvard diploma. we still get access to the same alumni network. we have the same status and privilege as those to attend the other harvard schools. we still get to walk in the commencement ceremony with everyone else. we still receive a world class education many folks can only dream of at one of the most elite schools in the world. 

anyone who looks down on your education and hard work isn’t worth having in your network.

many of the stem courses in hes are also literally the exact same courses as gsas or harvard college courses. the only difference is that you have an ""e"" before the course number for administrative purposes."
1405,"the 1% statistic is definitely misleading, but there is quite a bit of evidence that the extension school is much harder to be admitted to than is often assumed. i calculated, using data that has actually been released by the university, that the admit rate for the extension school's undergraduate program is about 7%, and that the rate for its master's program is about 44%.

1406,"yes that's part of the process at least to be allowed to apply for the undergraduate program. one of those does have to be from expo 25... definitely not the hardest course in the universe, but when i took it the instructor did have this intense ""so you mortals think you can hang at harvard?"" drill sergeant sort of vibe. i think the exclusivity is hard to measure since there are loads of other factors (work, kids, unexpected divorce, life in general) that might prevent someone from reaching the point where they are admitted or finish. i also personally know a few students who were admitted and transferred out to more specialized schools like berklee and risd. at the end of the day most of us (including myself) are just happy to get the damn degree and don't worry about whether or not we are among a chosen few."
1407,"no, they take summer session courses. hes students can also take summer session courses and they'll count towards their degree, but the summer session is not hes.

1408,"read the post and then find specific points from my analysis to refute. you will find this hard to do. 

but it is important to remember that that's 7% of the general population, not 4.5% of an already elite cohort, which is the case with harvard college."
1409,"you are conflating many things.

the group of students who apply for the hes is very different than the group of students who are applying for hc or other graduate programs at harvard (i know that you've acknowledged this). 

but in addition, you state that ""most people who sign up for classes and state that they are pursuing admission, fail to earn the grades needed for them to be admitted to be a degree candidate"". how are you measuring this? do all hes students have to explicitly declare before they matriculate what their intentions are with hes? are these declarations binding? what if you change your mind, and then let your grades slip as a result? 

for at least these two reasons, it is not appropriate to compare admissions statistics across programs."
1410,harvard undergraduate liberal arts courses are not significantly more difficult than courses at any other college in the us. i do not believe that only 7% of applicants are capable of getting b's or above. most probably have no intention of applying.
1411,"yes, you must select your intentions for taking classes when you sign up for them. if one submits an application to harvard college and then decides that they don't want to go to college and their grades slip as a result, their rejection is still reflected in admission statistics."
1412,"not personally no, but i’d be stunned if the administration wasn’t lenient about w’s this past semester. harvard admin (like all admin...) has a lot of red tape and hoops to jump through, but once the hoops are jumped through they are understanding.

raise this concern to your tutor (or if you’re a freshman, a tutor in your future house) and they can help you get the ball rolling regarding getting an answer for you."
1413,"ec concentrator here, dm if you’d like more info. 

*ec50* was a fantastic course. the course is about solving societal problems (e.g. systematic income inequality, education reform) using economics and big data. it’s taught as an intro course in large lecture format, so even with no economics experience, you’ll have a rewarding time. it’s taught by raj chetty, the smartest harvard professor i’ve ever met. the content is super interesting and the course is structured super well, plus raj is an incredible lecturer and seems to know the answer to everything.

*ec10a* is, of course, the intro ec course at harvard. it’s a solid intro to microeconomics and really good if you’ve had little economics experience since they try to walk you through the concepts. make sure that you find a tf that you like for *ec10a*, and you’ll be fine. i enjoyed this course since it got me really excited about basic microeconomics.

from personal experience, i don’t recommend *ec10b*, the *ec1010* series, the *ec1011* series, or *ec1123*. they start to become less exciting imo and more technical. *ec10b* might be good if you’re particularly interested in macroeconomics but otherwise wasn’t particularly engaging.

your mileage with *ec970* will really depend on who your preceptor is. since all classes follow the same assignment structure, your choice of instructor will heavily impact how your assignments are graded and how well your course is taught. i strongly recommend thoroughly reading the q guide if you’re interested in these courses. also, note that it’s best to have the *ec10 series* under your belt for these courses; taking *ec1123/1126* will also be hugely helpful with stata."
1414,"commenting bc i think i have the opposite experience of that other guy — i think which ones you like will largely depend on how much you like math. imo there is somewhat large divide in the ec department between the math-heavy econ courses where you model things, etc vs the more conceptual ones. this begins largely with 1010 vs 1011 (with 1011 being more math focused) and continues thereafter.

depending on your post-grad aspirations and joy for mathematical thinking, you’ll probably gravitate toward one of these sets of classes and enjoy one more than the other. because of this, i’ve probably enjoyed 1011a the most out of any econ class (seriously, glaeser is incredible) and other electives that require it. 

also, not a harvard class but mit’s econ department is phenomenal and quite small in terms of undergrads so it’s always fun to try and take a course there! they have some great offerings — for instance, i know their public econ course and econometrics course are great."

1418,"they're called ""final clubs"" (no ""s""), and some of them used to be frats.

a couple of them are extremely old, but the rest are former frats that got cut off from their national networks when harvard college banned frats many years ago.

in practice they're pretty similar to frats (and sororities; there are female final clubs), except that their network includes only fellow harvard college graduates (no other chapters).

while it's true that yale has no final clubs, it has something even more exclusive: secret societies. still, to the extent yale secret societies have parties, most people don't even know they're happening, whereas people know about the final clubs' parties at harvard but just can't necessarily get into them."

1420,"i'm a staff member who takes the occasional extension school class so i don't have personal experience as a college student (which is why my comment was more about bureaucratic specifics and generalities about mental health). 

regarding what the college could do more of, that's based mostly on what i read in the crimson, mostly a desire for easier access to mental health services and lowering barriers to return after a leave. a lot of that is opinions not based on comparisons to any other school (i.e. harvard might be comparatively quite good but for any student who has difficulty may not consider it good).

1431,"as a graduate student at harvard who didn't go here for undergrad, work as hard as you possibly can. even if you don't get in for your undergraduate years you can still prove yourself and apply here for post-graduate work if you still desire. 

i had nowhere near the credentials to get into harvard as an undergraduate, but my college grades and resume proved that i was capable of graduate level work. you can do the same. push yourself."
1432,"harvard is indeed a crapshoot sometimes, considering there are so many qualified applicants that eventually, you have to start turning people away.

and don't let your friends discourage you. i came from your average hs whose only redeeming factor was the ib program and i made it to the ivy leagues too (not harvard though).  i was in awe of a lot of the people i met there and where they came from, but i was able to do well nonetheless. do not be discouraged by where you come from, because you can always get better."

keep in mind that a school doesn't define who you are or what you can be.  i'd draw an analogy between colleges and _x_ round draft picks in sports.  sure, harvard opens up doors and you'll meet some amazing people, but i've met many equally impressive people later on in life who went to state schools.  some of them were late bloomers or had other reasons why they ended up going to what some may perceive as a different tier of undergrad, but we all ended up in similarly good situations."
1434,this is true. show a trend of improvement in grades. school president is good but what motivates you to get up in the morning? if your answer is to get in to harvard then you need to reconsider your priorities. passion about something and leadership in that particular area will get you noticed. having ten clubs just shows that you can't focus and are trying to be cookie cutter like the previous commenter said.
1435,"thank you so much. i'll be frank with you, it just feels like its impossible looking at entry statistics. when i told my close friends who go to a private hs that i'm working on going to harvard, they just sort of laughed and said that no one from my crummy public high school can go to harvard. i really took a blow from that. that's why i didn't try much freshman year. then when i saw a senior get accepted, i said to myself ""it's possible."" i'm going to have to work hard on my ap exam for bio at the end of the year (which is really quite nerve-racking). as well as the sats and acts next year. 

anyways, thanks so much man. i really appreciate it."

1443,"harvard undergrad, studied abroad at oxford, summer at cambridge. econ secondary at harvard and ppe at oxford.

in my experience, harvard is more intense academically. that's more of a personal opinion, though. at oxford and cambridge, you have 1-2 hours of ""class"" per week when you meet with profs. everything else is self-directed and you have the option to go to lectures. that was way easier for my work style. ultimately, you'll get out of your education what you put in, regardless of institution. oxbridge grading relies heavily on all-or-nothing end of term tests, which i despise. 

the colleges at oxbridge have way better comradery than harvard houses. in general, there's a much healthier social atmosphere. the drinking age being 18 makes a huge difference because people go to clubs and social organizations don't act as social gateways. i did like that harvard was right next to a proper city - oxford and cambridge are too far away to just pop down to london. oxbridge are definitely more old money. harvard tends to have a stronger activist community, from what i've seen. there's also a different emphasis on extracurriculars. it wasn't unusual for half or more of people's time to go to extracurricular activities at harvard - and most of these activities are pre-professional groups. it's not unusual at oxbridge for people to have no organized extracurricular activities beside hanging out in the jcr. organized sports are also less emphasized, as is the standard outside of american universities. one plus for me is that harvard is four years, where as most degree programs at oxbridge are only three. that could definitely be a positive for someone else, though.

hate to be that guy, but can't go wrong. pros and cons on both side, just gotta weigh your preferences."
1444,">i myself am from eastern europe.

> • politically right

harvard itself is pretty conservative academically, on average adhering pretty closely to the ideology of neoliberal moderates, at least in my experience. it depends on what field you're interested in though. there are notable exceptions on all sides of the political spectrum.  

cambridge (the city harvard is in, not the uni!) is sarcastically known as ""the people's republic of cambridge"" because it has a pretty vibrant left scene, especially around central sq. 
> athletic

boston and its environs are one of the best running areas in the u.s., harvard has several gyms too. 

>outgoing

the boston area is really student central, there are literally hundreds of thousands of undergrads/grads in the metro area during the school year, it leads to a pretty unique social scene, despite this, it's also a major metropolitan city. cambridge (uk) is basically a college town, it's based around the university in a way boston just isn't."
1445,"congrats on all of your admissions! a word of caution on the politically right bit: if that's super important to you, you may want to think twice about attending harvard as the general political atmosphere can be quite liberal. maybe the political spectrum is different in eastern europe, but coming from the midwest in the united states, harvard was definitely more left than where liberals from my hometown consider themselves to be on the spectrum. of course, there are students and organizations who are conservative (and make that known about themselves), but you may feel like you're sometimes in the minority (if that would bother you)."
1446,"i was also between harvard and stanford for economics. now a harvard undergrad, though i changed my concentration to another social science my sophomore year. a couple of things that might be helpful:

\- stanford is much more entrepreneurial than harvard, but imo it's almost to a fault. i disliked that everyone at stanford was trying to invent the next greatest thing at any given moment rather than ask questions like *what* should be invented, *why* should we invent it, etc.

\- the harvard social scene is weird. a lot of people care about social climbing yet simultaneously lack actual social skills. you know, the kind that help you make real friends. idk that stanford's social scene is better, but harvard's is just off. 

both are great schools, you can't go wrong. good luck!"
1447,"current harvard undergrad, international student, previously spent summers in stanford & cambridge and spent a lot of time making the choice between cambridge (a social science subject) and harvard for undergrad.

&#x200b;

on us vs uk

(1) the more flexible, less academic focused environment that allowed for more academic and career exploration, and at age 18 i wanted space to try different things — i could still work closely with faculty doing intense academic work if i wanted to, but that wasn't the only thing i could do to a high level. since coming to harvard i've pivoted my academic and career direction completely, and i really wouldn't have been able to if i went to cambridge.

(2) the more relaxed, diverse, open, warm culture which fit my personality better. i regularly visit the uk to see my friends who are there and the sense that i get is that so much of social activity consists of mindless drinking, which i personally really didn't see the point in. you can still mindlessly drink here but at least you have more options if you didn't want that.

(3) on being entrepreneurial, there's not really a better place to be than the us —  other country's companies try to copy what business models that began years ago in the us, rarely vice versa; the opportunities you will get in tech in the us if you studied cs or were interested in vc is unparalleled.

&#x200b;

on stanford vs harvard

  
(1) i felt that harvard preserved more optionality than stanford for me — i was hugely interested in cs and entrepreneurship but also wanted to learn more about government & life sciences. i could study anything at harvard and would still be in a world leading department with many peers and alumni in those paths, which was murkier for stanford...

(2) city life - being from a big city, i hated palo alto. i'm so glad i now live in boston and can go into the city in under 15 minutes any time.

happy to chat more over pm!"

1454,"the coop offers 10% off for members ($1 yearly membership, definitely worth it), and i believe there's a 15% (?) discount for students buying apparel. utilizing these, i think it's the cheaper option to the harvard shop.

most people seem to prefer the harvard shop, but i've had quality issues with them when i've attempted to purchase from them, as well as support issues, neither of which i've had with the coop.

i'd vote for the coop, but ultimately, just get whichever you like the look/feel of better."

wigg has a nice common room and laundry room in its basement. i think it actually has two common rooms. i also think it’s the largest frosh dorm, so there’s plenty of people to socialize with. it might be a little noisy since it’s so close to harvard sq/mass ave.

1464,"going into college, everyone is worried that they won't find friends or they won't fit in, but honestly, don't worry about it. everyone finds their friend group and harvard is such a welcoming place with so many nice and friendly people from all different backgrounds that you should have no problems finding friends! since you're an international student, i recommend that you sign up for fip (first-year international students program), which is a pre-orientation specifically designed for international students to interact with their international peers. one of my international roommates did this program and enjoyed it a lot, he met a lot of great people and made a lot of close friends through that. also, the first week of campus, or freshman week, is full of a lot of great events, socials, and parties to go to where you could meet a lot of new people. also, harvard does a good job with regards to creating a great entryway community in your dorms. you guys to have weekly study breaks where you can interact and chat with other people in your dorm entryway along with you paf's, who are upperclassman carefully selected to help incoming freshman with any social or academic issues. or, you can meet people at clubs, classes, or other social events! overall, freshman year at harvard is a time like no other, you are constantly meeting new people and there's always something fun to do. i miss it a lot. congratulations on your acceptance and enjoy! "
1465,"i was a freshman last year and i wish i knew what i know now. definitely read that slow down article someone else linked here. what follows are my personal experiences, which not everyone will agree with, but since my friends experienced the same things, perhaps this will help. 

\- manage your time well. out of all things, this was my biggest issue and led to lots of stress. perhaps you're already excellent at it, but chances are you're not. buy a serious planner. write down everything you need to get done every day. don't just write academic stuff down \- write extracurricular, social, and personal obligations. include time for your personal interests and projects. and sleep. this might sound obvious, but seriously, don't neglect it. knowing what needs to get done and physically etching out what your week will look like will save you so much stress. also checking tasks off is really satisfying haha. 

\-  take that slow down advice seriously. when i arrived, i was instantly affected by the intense ambition i saw in my peers. i began to feel insecure with taking ""moderate"" courses and chased the hardest ones i could possibly take. my ego wouldn't let me do anything else. this was horrible for my physical and mental health. my grades ended up fine but i had to sacrifice so much for them. ambition is healthy, but it often clouds judgment. you might think you want to drown yourself in real analysis and kantian ethics simultaneously because the *idea* of being intensely absorbed in fields you're passionate about sounds appealing. and it actually is, but what you don't consider is that there are very few hours in the week, and being constantly sleep deprived, eating extremely quick meals at the berg, barely seeing your friends, and sitting in the same damn chair at whatever library for 8\+ hours every day 7 days a week is not fun. it's soul\-sucking. and come august, i guarantee your ego will shoot through the roof pressuring you to take a bunch of hard ass classes, but take a step back and remember that for the majority of people, there is more to life than doing problem sets all day. everyone in this thread is echoing this. take it seriously. and i'm not saying don't challenge yourself. do that, but appropriately. 

\- do not neglect your personal health. this is similar to the advice above but i mean it seriously. sleep deprivation is extremely unhealthy, so manage your time effectively so you can get your 8 hours every night. this won't happen all the time, and that's okay, but i guarantee you that you will be very unhappy if you get carried away with not sleeping well every night; coffee will stop working at some point lmao. and more importantly, do your best to stay fit. head to the gym and be active. human life has changed so much in the past 10,000 years, but our bodies are mostly the same. we were not meant to stay sitting down cooped up indoors all day; that will make you unhappy. go out, experience the world, and make use of your physical body, not just your mind.

\- control partying and drinking/drugs. this is something i saw get out of hand for lots of people, me included. it's the first year you're actually independent, and most kids who get into harvard probably didn't drink or do drugs in high school. definitely go out and have fun, but try not to go out and drink multiple times a week. harvard is gonna make you watch this alcohol harm reduction series right before the term begins, and it'll be super cheesy, but take it seriously. you don't know how many people i saw go to the hospital for over\-drinking. remember that getting completely shit\-faced is not that fun. you feel horrible. if you choose to drink, try keeping your limit at the tipsy/kinda drunk level because past that it's just nausea, vomiting, and a shitty hangover the next day. alcohol is physically damaging for the body, so also don't drink frequently, even if you don't have too much each time you do. every week, as you approach friday, a lot of your friends will be itching to to party to sort of dull the pain of an exhaustive week. it'll sound appealing (and it actually is fun), but also consider your personal interests and projects. if your week was full of academic work and you wanted to explore a personal thing of yours, don't let drinking and partying get in the way of that. those things are fun, but only in moderation. don't let them get in the way of things you actually want to do. 

\- be wary of the social ladder and people who try to climb it. yeah, it's harvard and we're past high school, but the ""social ladder"" of popularity still exists. it will be obvious who's popular and who's not when you're in the dining hall. it will be obvious to spot someone whose goal is to get into the phoenix. this can get to you if you feel like you're not one of the cool kids lmao; it's human to feel bad when you're not included. i also see a lot of people faking it to climb the ladder as well. i'm not really sure what my advice for this is tbh because everyone's social desires and expectations are different. i guess just take some time now to consider what you really want out of your social life.

\- don't be afraid to reach out to the mental health services at harvard (like cams) if you feel you need to. i didn't at all freshman year even though i was depressed (personal reasons). i will next year though. they're confidential and, from what friends tell me, actually help. 

sorry for the long post, i just really wish i knew what i know now before i started. you'll make mistakes but that's just life. you'll be okay and have a blast this summer. cheers "

1468,harvard can bring the graduate student body to its knees by curtailing all tgif expenditures.
1469,"any source?

harvard has been pouring tons of money into its engineering programs, so the growth there makes sense. i'm guessing it's cannibalizing some of the pure science concentrators, explaining the decrease in science. i'm curious what's the reason for the growth in social sciences, and what concentrations it encompasses."

1471,"(not a student), i usually say ""i work in a genetics lab in boston"" and then ""harvard medical school"" only if pressed further. "
1472,i used to take the boston track but now i just say i go to harvard. better than looking false modest when someone presses you on the boston thing. 
1473,just say harvard. it is the most factual and direct of any of the answer choices.
1474,"up north, then boston, and finally harvard if pressed to the point that 1. i'm sure they already know and just want to hear me say it, or 2. any amount of weirdness that results would be less weird than how much they're pressing me. "
1475,"> it's a good taste of harvard

rip yenching, panera, and abp, though"
1476,"and a few others in the holyoke center area. harvard is booting most of the businesses to start renovating the holyoke center for a something else. (i believe yenching and panera closed for other reasons, but definitely al's, abp are getting kicked)"
1477,"wow.  no wonder i was rejected.

on an unrelated note, i think it's time to unsubscribe from /r/harvard."
1478,"the number of admits is approximately the same, the main factor reducing admissions rates is increased applications.  part of this is that with each year, more people have access to education that makes them competitive for harvard.  another factor is a ratcheting effect in that, each year every school is getting more selective, so students applying to college are compelled to apply to more schools, which drops the admission rate lower.  it will be interesting to see how this trend progresses."
1479,"thanks!  i love harvard-made paninis!

i wouldn't have been able to afford harvard anyway, so my dreams aren't exactly crushed.  i'm probably going to accept that full-ride i got to an in-state public school.  it has a good honors college, and i can save my money to try again for grad-school.  :)"
1480,"i did math physics and graduated a few years ago and am now four years into a math phd (at another institution). the following are my recommendations (in decreasing order) based on my experience. 

i would highly recommend the 232 series. the more algebraic geometry you take in undergrad, the better (unless you definitely won't study it in grad school, then don't bother). it's also just a good way to learn algebra. for example, the theory of discrete valuation rings is best learned (in my opinion) through the language of schemes. however, i am an algebraic geometer now, so this is a biased recommendation. 

of course, 231 is a classic harvard math course. no math student should graduate without taking that at some point. it's also pretty accessible. i believe this semester hopkins is teaching it, which is awesome. he's a fantastic teacher and is one of the foremost in his field.

another recommendation i would give is 222. lie group theory is wonderful and i regret not taking that one. not sure how accessible it is. 

finally, 229 is always good. noam is a great guy and is hilarious and an absolute genius of course. you're unlikely to find another analytic number theory course like his elsewhere. perhaps a little less accessible. 

overall, i would prioritize classes that are especially good at harvard because of the experts that are there teaching them. you can take complex analysis anywhere (e.g. in grad school); but where harvard shines bright is the courses i mentioned above (and others)."
1481,"fas announced a new system coming, and they are shutting down the stadium testing. 

""to those who have participated in the return-to-work single-instance viral testing, carried out by harvard university health services (huhs) with supervised sample collection at the stadium in allston and the second site in longwood, thanks for your engagement and action on behalf of our community’s well-being. the university is shifting from that implementation to self-administered sample collection. if you work on campus more than 4 hours per week you’ll be periodically issued a self-collection kit (with appropriate instruction). you’ll swab the interior of your nostrils, place the swab in a tube, place the tube in a bag, and drop off the bag at one of a handful of deposition sites across campus. the transition to that new system, which avoids people having to go over to allston, is under way but not complete.

huhs is delaying the implementation of mandatory weekly testing until the new system is in place, i expect no later than the end of august. i advise science division colleagues to not schedule additional tests at this point, but rather to await the implementation of the next-gen system."""
1482,"tried to sign up yesterday, and again today, but keep getting this screen. not sure if it's because i was already tested once (but harvard states on its covid page that it encourages recurring testing?) or if all slots have been filled (but then i'd expect a waitlist to show up?). i tried calling the covid hotline, but they said they can't help with appointments. i've also tried emailing huhs but haven't heard back yet.

would appreciate hearing if anyone else is having this issue! thanks."
1483,"thanks all. they were indeed at capacity for the existing stadium testing slots, and are working on transitioning to the self-administered system. i wasn't able to get a self-administered test from harvard yet but was able to do walk-in testing at beth israel deaconness in chelsea and got my results within 24 hours--can recommend if you need to get tested but can't get an appointment with harvard at the moment."
1484,"official word just came out for harvard medical that all nonessential staff are to transition to remote work asap. 

i expect other schools to follow suit."
1485,"no disagreement that sending undergrads home is easier.  but the university is doing it under the context of safety.  employees are densely located in proximity to each other, unlike most graduate and professional students.

6,800 undergraduates

15,000 graduates and professional students

20,000 employees

harvard runs it's own graduate housing as well, and there must be three or four thousand people in that (close proximity/shared laundry and other spaces)

it's just a matter of numbers.  it only takes one staff member, who has a child or a friend who is infected, who themselves becomes infected, to go to work, sit among 20 of their colleagues, go to a half dozen meetings with a total of 50 other employees, who bring it back to their office spaces they share with 200 other employees, who bring it home to their families, etc., etc., and then you have thousands of sick people.  

graduate students don't interact in the same volume and proximity as employees."
1486,"i’m pretty sure harvard isn’t going to throw a grad student to the curb for missing a payment or two, but nothing in life is a free ride either. someone told me they are letting people out of their leases, which is better than some cambridge apartment owners who wouldn’t give a darn and hold people to their legal contracts."
1487,harvard is a great school for astrophysics. doing a joint with physics only really requires taking 3 or so classes on top of your astro requirements because of how much overlap there is.
1488,"i took one astro class and loved it. it's a really strong teaching department, for the most part. there's also great opportunities for research and projects through the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics. several of my astro friends were involved with that. 

the physics department is even stronger, in my opinion, especially for teaching. though i spent most of my time in the math department, some of my favorite professors were physics professors."
1489,i cant find this course on my.harvard(?)
1490,"a lot of club sports are very welcoming for people with absolutely no sports experience and have a strong team community (i.e. harvard taekwondo!!). i never vibed with the cultural groups - the people were great, but i preferred clubs that had a more concrete goal."
1491,"as someone on board of one of these orgs (not gonna say which one for privacy reasons) i cannot recommend enough recruitment! while it's been slow, we are working toward equal gender representation and i'm sure that most male members would agree! we also do a lot of mixers/dinners with final clubs, so if you're still interested in that aspect of harvard it's something worth considering"
1492,"call the aid office, your brother should have is own financial aid officer in his my.harvard portal"
1493,"anecdotal, based on information from a family friend who does aid at a top (wealthy) college.

income vs. assets is ranked differently during aid consideration. a university as wealthy as harvard doesn't want to cause financial hardship on their students with their tuition costs. if your brother contacts his personal aid officer and explains everything, i'm very confident that an adjustment would be made. make sure your brother fully outlines all the financial hardships y'all now have to take on (2 tuitions, single income, etc.) and i'm sure his package will he raised.

1500,"i was worried about my math experience when i got to harvard because i hadn't taken a full calc class yet, it just wasn't offered at my school. so i decided to ""start fresh"" in math m, and by god it is to this day the best math class i have every taken and 100% the reason i feel confident in my ability to do and understand math. 


even though i knew basic calculus up to like integration, relearning it the harvard way changed my life, they just did such a great job with the material and the way teach it. you derive and are taught why certain things are the way you are... you honestly just walk away with a robust knowledge of math in general. i miss it so much :')"
1501,"the reason why people consider this to be a case of police brutality is not because there was physical force used against the student. it is considered police brutality due to the level of physical force employed to deal with (at least what most people consider to be) a real problem. as you said, the student was clearly unarmed and did not pose sufficient threat to have been beaten as severely as he was. personally, i consider the punching to have been excessive. regardless of how severely the student was resisting, there are ways to restrain him without beating him senselessly. i think this is why people consider it to be a case of police brutality--not because there was force employed, but because the degree of the force was excessive. i'm not sure if in the context of police brutality in the us this would be considered to exemplify the issue, but because this case is particular to the harvard/cambridge community, it's reasonable to see why people are considering it to be so severe. this doesn't happen often around here, and especially not to harvard students-- until now, police brutality towards black americans has been very foreign to most of the harvard community, but the issue becomes a lot more real and personal when it strikes as close to home as it did this past weekend. "
1502,"aside from anything else, you're probably giving yourself harvard stress. you got into a fabulous school, and i'm sure you deserved the admission. but from everything you've said, it doesn't sound like the problem is limited to this one class.  

yes, talk to the prof, talk to the ta, but more important, get counseling. you said that you fucked up last semester and it sounds like you might be close to fucking up this semester too. understand that you're going through some shit and that you probably need some help to get through it.  

harvard is awesome. and can be stressful as hell. luckily you have great student health benefits and you need to take full advantage of them."

1505,"that's not really dispositive of the issues here. private universities are still bound by nondiscrimination law, and affirmative action has limits under the law despite *fisher*. but what's going on here isn't even immediately about the legality of harvard's policy; it's back-and-forth over what documents harvard is obligated to provide the department of justice."
1506,"i'm sure that discovery request is nice and broad, and as we've seen with pick-your-fav company with a substantial online presence these days, private data, once divulged, even if ""secured"", isn't really secured. stuff leaks out. and harvard is (rightfully) serious about keeping its student data private.

so, yeah, i'd expect this to be mired in discovery disputes for a while."
1507,"it's often slow, but what drives me up the wall is that is that it's constantly disconnecting on my phone, which keeps bouncing between harvard secure, harvard university, eduroam, and giving up altogether and eating data. bonus: it took me over an hour to get harvard secure working on my phone when i first got here. and i'm doing a phd in computer science... "
1508,"yes.  furthermore, if you are on a linux client the shell script that needs to be run has shown to have issues on various flavors of fedora and centos.  (had some issues with a windows 10 client as well for a while.)  i finally gave up and switched to a mac.

(nor are they having a good time in the process). the whole point of college is to enjoy, reflect, and grow intellectually and as an individual, but a lot of people, it seems, take it as a game of ""who can get the highest grade""."
1514,"high key start with 1b. i made this mistake. math at harvard (and in college in general) isn’t the same as your high school math. i found there weren’t many redundancies, and it was taught much better than my high school (obviously). especially if you’re going to concentrate in math, it’s super important to have a good foundation. 

1b for sure!!! you’ll have plenty of time for additional classes. you don’t need to start out in 21a. trust me."

1524,tldr: harvard was allowed to trademark the harvard club of singapore name after they cut ties with the existing club. correct me if i’m wrong i skimmed it.
1525,[some background to cutting of ties ](https://www.asiaone.com/harvard-cuts-ties-alumni-club-singapore)
1526,they desanctioned the old one and set up a new one. but the president of the old one refused to go away and continued to operate the old club in parallel. harvard then takes out the trademarks to prevent her from doing so.
1527,she challenged and lost the trademark bring awarded to harvard
1528,"have a good look at courses at my.harvard, and study the prereqs for taking more advanced classes your freshman year (e.g. take math 25 instead of 21). this will put you waaaayyyyy ahead of others, which is very important. and yeah, don't listen to those who tell you not to measure your worth relative to others because that's how market measures your worth (e.g. internships, research positions)."
1529,"industry cares more about 21 vs. 25 than about gpa. some recruiters know harvard classes very well (they did research as part of their job, or went here) and taking 25/55 signals them that you are really smart (which you should be to take these classes in the first place). if you go to academia, then you will have to get 25-level proof background at some point anyways. if you end up taking applied classes like stat110 or cs124, you will be wwaaaaaayyyyy ahead of your classmates (which again is important as these classes are heavily curved). also, it is really hard to get below a- in a math class at harvard, so your concern doesn't count. but it is true that you shouldn't jump into these classes without preparing much. op tho has around 6 months before him, which should be enough to pick up the necessary prerequisities. also, yeah, try to not ruin your gpa."

1536,"i mean if you’re smart enough to be in harvard then there’s going one girl who’s like:

he’s really smart rather than “he’s a nerd”

but even then i don’t think anyone would say that"
1537,"it's probably, because of weird gender roles. women find guys who go to harvard smart and charming, while guys feel bad when their girlfriend is or seems to be smarter than him. this is my theory."
1538,"i find that a bit unfair, no? unless harvard gave him college credits regardless for the courses he completed."
1539,"i happened to see the book about this on a library shelf and it caught my eye. it’s called “conning harvard: the true story of the con artist who faked his way into the ivy league”

1540,"it's pretty easy to get through harvard without running into finals clubs if you don't seek them out. if you want to avoid the cutthroat atmosphere, then avoid clubs like consulting (hccg), the crimson, and finance clubs. every other club that i've had experience with has been extremely welcoming, especially non-academic/professional clubs like club sports."
1541,"being an international at harvard is great! even if there aren't that many people from your home country, the international community tends to stick together. this doesn't mean that your social circle is limited to international students though. of course, the culture in the us is different and especially if your native language isn't english, this means that it takes some time to adapt, and this isn't easy, but the community helps in making you feel that you aren't alone. 

honestly, if you don't engage with the club scene, you won't really have to deal with it at all. sure, it's messy and you will be reminded every once in a while that it is always there, but there are tons of people who just don't engage with that culture. clubs are very competitive and it is kind of annoying that this is the case, but i'd see this as a reality check, especially for the professional clubs. these are people who were the best at what they were back home and you really need dedication to that at harvard. even if you don't engage a lot with both of these things, i'm sure that you will be maintain a wide social circle. i have met very few people who have exclusively met through clubs. i'd be happy to answer any other questions you have!"
1542,"kids are probably less happy than the average undergrad (since it's cold / rainy and the classes are tough), but it's still college, which is a blast no matter where you go. international students (second-handedly at least) seem to do quite well here, likely at least in part because there are quite a few of them.

you can have an awesome experience at harvard just taking interesting classes, joining no-comp clubs, and never setting foot in the final clubs."
1543,how would you describe your experience with your peers? do you enjoy the social scene at harvard?
1544,"i wasn’t trying to say that you’ll have to ‘run’ into final clubs, i was more saying if you like parties/appreciate the social scenes that some schools (like big state schools) have, then the presence of final clubs is a blemish on the harvard experience that is hard to ignore"
1545,"it all depends on the intentions.

* when i announced i was accepted at harvard, i did try to be as tasteful as possible, but a part of me did feel worried, as i didn't want to be perceived as bragging. especially when i announced it to my friends.
* then i got to meet people who were accepted at other high prestige graduate schools, and they were not only bragging - they were feeling upright superior just because an acceptance letter.

i believe there are many factors to all of this, psych is out of my field of expertise to name all the factors, but i think it has to do with self-worth, and a person's own experiences and culture.

about self-worth, a lot of people that get accepted at top schools measure themselves by a certain aspect, maybe their  intelligence, their dedication and hard work, or even on their ambitions. this is not definitely a bad thing, at the end of the day you have been accepted to an exceptional school, but it is immature to define your self worth by it. going to school is just a part of life. sure, a lot of growth happens, but such growth will happen in some way or another, regardless of where you go.

about personal experiences and culture, not everyone is raised with concepts of propriety. i've read many answers on quora saying that the richest of people, the ""old money"" type, don't really like to announce their successes that much. why? because it may be perceived as boastful, which is a trait of those ""uneducated"". this is a limited, and personal perspective, and while i'm by no means rich, i was raised with the same values."

1548,"huh is not a bad option for your first year, but if you don’t mind commuting a bit then you could look at living somewhere in somerville or allston. the t (boston’s subway) is the easiest way to get around, so living off of the red line that goes through harvard square and is nearby like central, porter, or davis square are fine options too. 

it’s still going to be kinda hard to find a good place for a good price. there are many different universities in the area. my other advice would be to be already looking for good opportunities for housing. a lot of people will move out apartments and what not at the end of this school year, but the rooms will go fast."
1549,"i’d also recommend the housing fb group. also the harvard grad market fb page (where people sometimes post apartments/roommate requests). you can find decent 2 or 3 brs with a roommate/roommates for ~$1200 from what i’ve seen.

another thing to consider with huh is that at least some (i think maybe all) places include utilities, so that’ll save you some too."
1550,i love the history of the campus. walking around knowing i'm in the literal footsteps of generations of leaders and founding fathers is moving. i like all of the ancient eight for that reason. i also find the architecture beautiful. it's not hard to imagine the days when students had to cut their own wood for fuel or when harvard yard was a grazing field for cows.

1554,okay... but how flexible is harvard about switching them? 
1555,harvard is pretty flexible in my opinion. your first year is designed to let you explore different things.
1556,"hey i feel you — harvard can be a really difficult place socially, and as a freshman i also felt like i didn’t belong in my friend group. the thing is, from a social standpoint it truly doesn’t matter all that much who you block with. i ended up blocking with my freshman year friends, and although i still see them around from time to time by virtue of living in the same entryway, we don’t really interact anymore — and that’s okay because we’ve all made different friends through classes and clubs and just meeting people, which i’m sure you will as well. finish up this semester strong and i promise things will eventually work out! "
1557,"sorority recruitment was a big thing for me, but harvard has ensured that’s gone now. try meeting friends of friends. it is still early even though it seems things are moving quickly; idont mean to scare you but it gets harder the later in the year it gets. go to big group things like parties or primal scream and try and talk to people in the settings in which you’ll want to hang out with them.

1562,"i came to harvard as a freshman from california, never having seen snow in real life before. even though folks are (hilariously) trolling you below, a lot of them probably cannot empathize with having lived in a place with good weather year round (shots fired). so here is what i recommend doing:

1. embrace the fact that it will be freezing during the winter (though the coldest time in january you'll hopefully be away for break). first snow is actually super fun to play around in. it's the melty slush in february that will be miserable. most of the time though, you'll be inside with tons of heat so it'll be fine.
2. do **not** buy winter gear before coming to boston (e.g. in tennessee). it won't be warm enough.
3. go to a store near harvard square/boston like rei, patagonia, north face, etc. and get the following items. sometimes you have to wait until \~october for all the winter stuff to come into the stores. just call and ask.

* warm winter jacket (e.g. [pea coat](https://www.google.com/search?q=pea+coat&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=x&ved=0ahukewjdt-amv4pcahwgkhwkhy-jcoeq_auicygc&biw=1440&bih=711) and/or [patagonia](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1440&bih=711&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=frg7w7s0mczs_wsd1zu4cg&q=winter+coat+patagonia&oq=winter+coat+patagonia)/[north face](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1440&bih=711&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=nlg7w9vvbkrb0glg5j7ibg&q=winter+coat+north+face&oq=winter+coat+north+face) style jacket)
* few warm layers (i.e. micro down jacket)
* water proof [snow boots](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1440&bih=711&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=9lg7w7fyiyej0glm0klaaw&q=snow+boots&oq=snow+boots)
* warm gloves
* scarf
* ear warmers/hat"
1563,"background: went to harvard after living in the carolinas my whole life.  walked everyday from union square to hbs for several years.

summer: there is no spring or fall. winter runs from november to may then it immediately gets hot. bostonians are in denial when they say it doesn't get hot. it does. and because no one has central ac and you have to walk or take a crowded, non-ac bus or train anywhere outside of harvard, so the heat is far more miserable. you will think you need to dress more warmly when you start school. i did this. big mistake. dress like its the middle of summer. you will be walking outside a lot and classes will be crowded during shopping period and have poor ac. also, there will be a cold snap in october, they'll turn the heat on but then it will get hot again and you'll be sweating for the rest of october in class.

winter: in the dead of winter, pants with long johns underneath, scarf, and a long jacket with big pockets for your gloved hands. pockets are more important than gloves. keeping your face warm will be hard, so be ready for your eyes to freeze. i wouldn't go nuts on the winter gear though. layers work miracles and can be put together cheaply. also, an umbrella in the snow might look goofy but it will keep you dry and warm.

infrastructure: bostonians don't give a flying fuck about snow. there will be a travel ban in place if snow is really bad and you'll still see people speeding up and down the highway. sidewalks will be shoveled on campus but will be very narrow so you have to walk single file. when the snow thaws, the sidewalks will flood between the snow banks with up to an inch or more of water. this is very important: get tall waterproof boots. 

rain noreasters: this is the hardest part to get ready for. walking north from the river towards campus is a bitch during a noreasters - you will get soaking wet. ponchos, rain protector for you book bag, and a wind-proof umbrella are a must."

1576,"what attracted me to harvard and the cambridge-area as a whole was the prospect of surrounding myself with like-minded individuals. of course, this is a generalization, but the way i saw it while deciding - would i rather be in a state school surrounded by a bunch of insignificant, alcoholic idiots who will most likely get their bachelors and settle for a dead-end job working in the basement of a corporate building, orrrrrrr constantly be around and working with intelligent, curious, multi-faceted and motivated students?

the answer was clear. it is a fantastic community."

1578,"*""for the ""earn-your-way-in"" admissions, i was thinking of taking the three suggested courses that are on the extension school's website (expo 15, expo 25, and math e-3). the advisor i spoke to mentioned that they would count towards the degree itself. any thoughts on this? how were the courses themselves?""*

can't speak about these since i didn't take these classes. it will depend on your field whether you take two or three classes for admission. as someone in the alm bioeng/biotech thesis track, we only required two classes for admission - proseminar and a life sciences course.

""*i noticed that there's an on-campus requirement. how was this for folks? was it a pain trying to find parking/getting a parking pass from the university? (i live a little under an hour north of cambridge in maine)""*

i live in the area so the on-campus wasn't difficult for me. however, i have met people who have traveled in to take classes and some even just do the on-campus during the january and summer sessions. it really depends on what you can manage given your day to day life. many people pursuing the graduate program are working full time in either the small biotech space, pharma, consulting firms, private businesses, etc. it is a pain if you drive, but if your class meets late enough, you may be able to snag a spot. i'd park at one of the red line stations and commute down (alewife down to harvard) if you are worried unless you want to try your luck.

*""how were the online classes/courses? i'm no stranger to online learning, but i do know that every school has their own ""spin"" when it comes to online education.""*

this is a hit or miss but most of the time it was enjoyable. certain professors make the most out of the platform while others struggle to find a happy medium since they have primarily only taught on a board and gave a physical lecture. they is very good discussion during the classes and i found most to be very helpful in my learning.

""*how's financial aid for the extension school? i noticed that it was mentioned online, and briefly said by the advisor i spoke with, but is it generous (if needed, i would only be taking sixty-four credits for the degree, as i will have sixty-four credits transferring into the program itself; also, i currently have a 3.67 gpa, if that goes into academic scholarship decision-making).""*

this is also dependent on your financial need. my understanding that there is slightly more financial aid opportunities for those pursuing a alb than anyone pursuing a graduate degree (we get a piece of a nice grant and loan options).  as for transfer credit, i'm not qualified to answer that question since i pursued a traditional bachelor degree at another institution but chose a job afterwards rather than jumping straight back into a traditional degree program.

*""and lastly, for those of whom who have graduated from this program, is it worth it? i've read other comment sections/blogs/posts where some have had difficulties with their degrees, due to the phrasing of the degree itself (""bachelor of liberal arts in extension studies,"" even though they majored/concentrated in environmental studies), and was just wondering if there was any sort of ""stigma"" attached to the degree, or if the majority of what i read was just a bunch of hot air.""*

the experience is what you make of it. if you are honest with your credentials, your effort will speak for itself down the road. respect the guidelines in place. harvard extension school is **not** harvard college. it is easy in conversation to say you went to harvard university but can easily be taken out of context leading to either trolls or ""stigma"" which i'm sure you have encountered by just sifting through this sub-reddit/twitter/etc. i am taking a class where someone graduated from hes with an alb and is now in medical school at mayo clinic doing an md/phd but also is a teaching assistant for the course. his track is a bit unique all around but definitely motivational for those that wish to pursue the program. thus, it is what you make of your experience and leveraging your network/experience whether you are going to pursue further education or go into the work force.

i'd be happy to provide more context if you're interested. just dm me."
1579,"* i took expo 15 and expo 25, mostly to get my confidence up after being out of school for a decade. they're pretty much the same ap english course/freshman english course every school requires to prove that you an write can essay. expo-15 had a smaller class size and more english-as-a-second-language students, though i took that in 2001, so that may no longer be true.

* can't answer, i lived and worked on the red line while i attended.

* online courses were just starting up while i was there. the videos were available to the local students as well, i remember being impressed with the triple-synced-screens from one of the programming courses that let you watch the lecturer, his programming terminal, and the board at the same time.

* can't answer, i was using tuition reimbursement from my job. you'll find that the technical classes are priced significantly higher than the liberal arts courses, as most of the students will be professionals taking a particular course, rather than degree students.

* yes, it was worth it. the vast majority of the instructors are masters of their craft, and teaching in the evenings to have even more students to teach. highlights for me were boston history taught by an emeritus bu professor, intro to geology taught by an emeritus mit professor, and chaucer taught by the editor of 'the riverside chaucer'.

as to the stigma, i've always put extension school on my resume, and in conversation started with, ""you know those posters on the t about discover harvard in the evening? i did that."" i also refrained from wearing anything with a harvard logo until after getting the degree, so i probably avoided a lot of drama. 

one final note - if you're transferring in the maximum 64 credits, you'll want to keep an eye on the harvard instructor(hi) requirement. i wound up taking an extra two classes at the end to fulfill that one."
1580,"cs181 is dogshit, i regret taking ml at harvard and wish i had done it at mit. i loved cs121, but i also took a proof based math course freshmen year, if cs121 is your first proof based class it is going to suck. cs124 was amazing with jelani but he is unfortunately leaving.  everyone loves to shit on cs51, but that course actually teaches you how to program, and the most relevant programming paradigms. i think most people complain about cs courses because of the workload, but that doesn't necessarily mean its a badly taught course."
1581,"lol that’s rich coming from a harvard subreddit, where 95% of the student body and their families feel entitled to the labor of everyone around them."
1582,"it is a thing. it doesn’t necessarily refer to how grades are distributed in any individual class but rather to the culmination of all grades given out. the average gpa is slowly creeping up at harvard college. the top 10% of the class 2 years ago had a 3.80 or above; last year it was just over 3.82; and this year it’s expected to be closer to 3.84. that’s what grade inflation is- each class gets slightly higher grades on average than the previous. 

it brings into question the point of an abcd grading system if it’s de facto failing to get below a b? b should actually be the average. "
1583,"i've only been at harvard for 3 semesters, but from what i can tell, it really depends on the specific class (or sometimes the department). i definitely haven't noticed any overarching ""grade inflation."" if you got good grades, congrats! if you didn't, that's fine. don't let talk of ""grade inflation"" influence how you view your own academic success."
1584,"harvard seeks and does educate the next generation of leaders, broadly defined. 

one can be a success at some things as an introvert. one can be successful at many more things as an extrovert. being an extrovert doesn’t preclude success in fields which might allow for introverts. 

if harvard does favor extroverts it’s the university’s own decision to make. an intellectually coherent one. and probably a wise one. 
"
1585,"honestly, while i understand why asian students feel shafted when they look at the numbers, this lawsuit and the thought process of the people behind it proves - in many ways - what they are trying to protest... these kids think its just about pure numbers and straight academics.. harvard does and ought to seek to educate the next generation of leaders in a very broad definition..   


sure, fair harvard could probably fill her freshman class with strictly asian americans (or whites, or african americans) with perfect sat scores and grades but not only would harvard be worse for it, but society would as well. 

&#x200b;"
1586,"the subtitle is a good summary of the article's thesis: ""if a lawsuit over affirmative action is successful, would-be college students may have to hide their race.""

&#x200b;

if affirmative action is cancelled - why would anyone have to hide their race? is the automatic assumption that harvard will deceitfully try to suss out race and break the law? (stop snickering!)

&#x200b;

and is being free to showcase your race to harvard really that much of a privilege? "
1587,"i think if harvard didn't cap asian enrollment for so long, but naturally let it rise year over year to a 35% level such that the break town was roughly 33% white, 33% asian, 33% urm a lot of this could've been avoided.

harvard uses aa as a shield to protect what they really want, which is a white majority (which only recently fell below 50%) and certainly a white plurality. 

but by judiciously taking that route, a lot of white alums would've become pissed off. "
1588,"> i don't particularly care if harvard is 100% asian. if they present the strongest academic potential, why not?

i would care. race is a major component of many people's identity and background. a huge part of an education from a liberal arts college is being surrounded by people from different backgrounds and perspectives that challenges your own perspective. take that away, and dialogue on campus would become much more stale."
1589,"it’s not racist at all, but the lawsuit shows wilful ignorance of some blatant facts. the point is we all know the admissions process isn’t all numbers or even all academics.  we would all have sued the football team if it admissions were all about academics. harvard is upfront about the process being non formulaic. 

so sure i can understand why the plaintiffs in the case are upset, i even see merit in their argument, but i see a lot less given harvard  has never said “hey, we’re accepting the 2000 academically smartest kids every year”. also, i’m not even sure how you’d do that in disciplines which have a degree of subjective grading, so their lawsuit, if successful, probably would alter the composition of concentrations as well. 
"
1590,"first, i happen to dispute you on the facts: the article itself says that asian students have grown by a third in 8 years (that's a lot). 

secondly, you seem to think that  harvard being ethnically diverse just happened overnight and all alumni must be white people (not only that, white people who are hell bent on preserving some sortof ethnic purity on campus. you must have a pretty low opinion of your alumni to harbor those feelings). while you're right, only recently did whites fall below 50% of a class, it had hovered around the 50% level for a couple of decades which means that close to half of alumni who are at the age of having their children apply will be non-whites.. "
1591,"without knowning the strength of the asian applicant pool, you don't know if it is a lot (the growth rate) or not. i happen to believe ( and the data shown by dr. arcidiacono) suggests that that growth is still undershooting what the accepted mix should be if all ethnicities/races were treated the same. 

no, my point is that harvard has dragged it's heels on ethnic diversity and really is cognizant hitting certain 'racial mixes'. 

i don't think white alums are hell bent on preserving ethnic purity on campus - but i also know that white alums didn't and still don't want to see white enrollment drop into the 30% range.

1592,"i’m actually very concerned that you lack critical reading abilities. no where did i say - or would i say - that asians lack the ability to be leaders. what i did say was that harvard seeks to educate leaders, broadly defined, from all walks of life and across a very broad range of skills and disciplines. by your definition of acceptable credentials the worlds best cellist might not be accepted to the college because he had less than perfect grades and test scores. i’m a proud harvard alumnus because the university looks for excellence in a diversity of talents, skills, backgrounds, and interests. unfortunately in some ways those don’t always fit into narrow bands of test scores and grades. for the sake of the people i’ve met with my 20 year association with the college, i’m very thankful for the fact they don’t.  

"
1593,"considering that 63% of the usa is non hispanic white if the harvard population dropped to 30% white it would either be the result of a huge move towards international enrollment at harvard or a racist admissions process. 

harvard is 87% domestic admissions so you would expect in the long run at least 55% of the admissions to be white, assuming a fair system, uniform achievement between races and no demographic change

 "
1594,i already have. harvard has never made the statement admissions is strictly academics or simply formulaic. this case seems to rest on the idea that admissions are a game of just numbers.

that's where you are clearly mistaken. harvard's own details show that.

public comment on the recent ny times article.

  
**tim** massachusetts july 30

**i went to harvard. i got in for two reasons. my senior year of high school i made a computer model of the inside of a star. for my admission essay i wrote about my ambivalent attitude towards science as a form of knowledge, that it had to be approached with a humanities understanding. it was a pretty subtle piece of work for a teenager. while at harvard i knew plenty of hard-working ethnically asian students. none of them showed that subtlety. there were lots of non-asian kids who had done exceptional things (like, for example, my roommate who got his board game published). individuality is a western creation, it is not asian. this lack of personal uniqueness has big consequences. there are no asian counterparts to galileo, newton, edison, einstein, steve jobs. the wright brothers are a perfect example. why didn't some smart chinese mechanics invent the airplane first? were any even trying? harvard is recognizing this lack of individuality in its admissions, as it should.**"
1600,"yeah, definitely a hot take analogy there. a rejection from harvard ≠ centuries of violent oppression, dehumanization, and forced labor."
1601,"i would bet tim did not go to harvard. his story about getting admitting doesn't sound right, neither does saying ""it was a pretty subtle piece of work for a teenager"". it's much more likely he's a cat fishing white supremacist.   "
1602,"> there are no asian counterparts to galileo, newton, edison, einstein, steve jobs. 

and this bozo claims he went to harvard? sure. 

tim, your ignorance of asian history and its collection of scientists, inventors, philosophers, and entrepreneurs does not equate to an absence of talent over millenniums of human civilization. "
1603,"those who were subject to oppression and forced labor doesn't always get to enter harvard. for example, two thirds of harvard afams are actually african and caribbean immigrants. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/us/top-colleges-take-more-blacks-but-which-ones.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/24/us/top-colleges-take-more-blacks-but-which-ones.html) "
1604,"race has an effect in educational achievement doesn't mean people are automatically privileged because of their race. a lot of the sat test prep courses are free including the one prepared by khan academy. and in harvard, sat actually plays very little role in admission, the academics is looked at from a far wider perspective. 

for harvard's case, diversity means only racial diversity. 15% of their class is actually from top 1% earners and so their commitment towards socio-economic diversity is in statements only. once they adjust those, i don't think we would need something more than a little nudge to adjust it for under-represented races. "
1605,"private schools are one of the noteworthy examples. from 2019 harvard class survey -

>most surveyed students—63 percent—live in the suburbs. just 9 percent of respondents are from rural areas. before coming to harvard, 63 percent of respondents attended public school, most of them non-charter, while 35 percent attended private school

private schools enroll around 9% of us students. we need more diversity, isn't it? the glorification of academics of the rich should be looked at. a lot of poor kids can't even afford money-consuming extra-curricular activities. the class based action would definitely take these into consideration. yet, none other than california is committed to it."
1606,"the college doesn't report and probably doesn't collect at all, information about whether all african american students' grandparents were born in the u.s., the information from the article was student interfviews and surveys. it doesn't look like there have been newer editions of the black guide to life at harvard.

the incoming class is [15.5% african american, last year 14.6%](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/3/29/harvard-regular-admissions-2022/). if they're using the federal standard for race reporting, a student with a white parent wouldn't be counted as african american, they'd be counted as ""two or more races"" (there's a good chance they're not, since i've never seen an admissions percentage for that category). 

the incoming class has 20.3% eligible for pell grants, double the number in 2004, when the article was written. a greater number of low income students may mean that more of the african american students admitted are from families that have lived through generations of structural inequality.

the facts and debate the ny times article is about is interesting, i hadn't heard of it before and i started working here not long after the article. that i haven't heard of it is most easily explained by my ""information bubble"" but one could argue that if the debate was broadly being engaged in, it would have pierce my bubble, i certainly am familiar with other topics related to diversity, and black people specifically, at harvard. dr. gates doesn't seem to have made it an ongoing subject for his attention."
1607,"> for harvard's case, diversity means only racial diversity.

that's not true. harvard has some of the best financial aid in the country and one of the most truly need-blind admissions policies. yes, students for wealthy families are still wildly over-represented (partially because of the preference given to legacies) but the number of students from lower income homes has been increasing and one in five of the incoming class is eligible for a pell grant."
1608,"what federal money are you thinking of? most federal money harvard receives is for research grants, most of which goes to people in the graduate schools, not the college. the research money is very important to the university but it's a tenuous purse string to try to connect to undergraduate admissions policies. pell grants and other federal financial aid goes to the students who then use it to pay harvard; even if it were more direct, i think harvard could easily turn down federal financial aid money if they didn't like new requirements that went with it."
1609,"everyone wants diversity, but harvard needs to stop claiming there is no ""cap"" on asian admissions.

clearly, asians are admitted at a much lower percentage. there is no cap ""smoking gun"" so far. instead, leaked admissions documents show asians being ranked lower via routinely lower scores on subjective qualities like ""likability"".

it seems to me that saying there is a cap or quota is less offensive than saying asians are less likable as a whole lol!"
1610,"disclaimer: i support the current admissions policies of the college, am asian american 

i’m curious though, i think the strongest argument that the sffa has against harvard is if they somehow get ahold of detailed statistics. for example, i am curious as to what the proportion of students from each racial group is admitted. for example, if only (making up numbers here) 10% of asian americans are admitted while 30% of caucasians are admitted, then i am interested in what their arguments will be. 

edit: added ethnicity"
1611,"no, seriously, i think the r/the_donald crowd sees a headline like this elsewhere and drops by r/harvard just to drop their *very, very* *well-informed* opinion about how affirmative action is unfair to the ~~master race~~ white and asian people.

fun thing: if someone comes in here arguing against aa, check their history. it's going to be posts in r/t_d, /r/cringeanarchy, /r/conservative, /r/milliondollarextreme, etc. "
1612,"i 100% agree with your entire reply. some notes:

> people are selfish and generally find ways to look out for their own interests.

i feel like this is the ultimate truth that everyone is uncomfortable expressing. people are generally going to support the policies that help them the most, and i guess a lot of my frustration is people pretending like that's not the case.

> if names and race were stripped from applications, schools like harvard would have a much larger population of asian americans.

absolutely. historically the rates of white students at harvard have floated around 50%. mit (my alma mater), has slightly weaker affirmative action, and around 40% white students. caltech, which only factors in race at the waitlist level, around 30-35%, and berkeley, which is by california law not allowed to consider race in the application, is at about 25%. berkeley has so many asian students that it breaks out its asia demographics by specific country. the evidence is pretty overwhelming that while affirmative action may disproportionately help under-represented minorities, it also significantly helps whites, almost entirely at the expense of asian applicants.

> but race/ethnicity tends to be an easier proxy for socioeconomic diversity so that's what admissions offices use.

i wonder how much of this is a holdover from a much data-poorer environment. the world we live in now is much statistically richer than when we first established these kinds of policies, and like your post seems to suggest maybe we could begin using a scalpel instead of a hacksaw to try to solve the underlying problem of unequal access to opportunities."
1613,"yeah, i'm a black student and even i have reservations of the race-based admissions at schools like harvard. largely because more than half of the black students at harvard and similar schools are first or second generation african immigrants. if this program was supposed to help the descendants of slavery/jim crow, why are so many africans taking these spots? it seems like harvard doesn't really care about black applicants, they just want to \*appear\* diverse, so they take rich africans and ignore poor, inner city black applicants. "
1614,"what is harvard?

what do we want to get out of harvard?

what does harvard do to its students?

these are difficult questions. anyone at the school knows that harvard is not like other colleges - it's more competitive, and many would say that it generally seems more stressful than many other colleges. (obviously there are similar colleges across the country) just like going into a stressful, competitive job, there will be challenges along the way. not everyone is cut out for every job, and not everyone is cut out for harvard for some of the same reasons.

i'm glad that there are conversations about mental health at harvard. like i just wrote above, harvard is a difficult place to attend school, but that doesn't mean that harvard can't try to help us with mental health issues. however, do you guys think that harvard isn't doing enough? i receive updates about camhs and smhl fairly regularly. i firmly believe that harvard takes mental health issues at our school seriously.

if anything, i believe harvard should make it abundantly clear about what prospective students are getting themselves into. harvard can be a pressure cooker, and students can burn out just as people burn out of high pressure jobs. the college does a lot to help us when these issues arise, but no one should attend harvard thinking it will be without stress, and sometimes there will be overwhelming pressure, but these are some of the things inherent to an environment like cambridge."
1615,"background: i did my undergrad at harvard in electrical engineering and i'm a cs phd student at cmu now.

it really depends on what you are interested in, but i found harvard's approach to cs to be a lot more theory-based than i would like compared to cmu or mit. that's not to say that the department is not a strong department, its just that there needs to be more time for the department to mature and move away from its applied math roots. conversely, the few ""hands-on"" courses that are there seem to have way too much busywork and end up just being a ton of implementation work. i found the machine learning course (cs 181) to be straight-up awful but from what i understand there has been some faculty changes since when i briefly took it and dropped the course before the add/drop period.

i would mirror what others have said in this thread and i would strongly avoid cs50. it was what turned me off to cs and if it wasn't for a particularly amazing cs faculty member who took me under his wing and mentored me, i would have not ever considered cs. cs50 caters to its own brand not to those who are genuinely interested in computer science. you would never see anything like that course in any ""real"" cs department. it creates a false sense of ""cs is fun"", which seriously rubs me the wrong way."
1616,"thank you so much for your input! one question, why don’t cs students at harvard cross-register at mit very often (or do they)? is there a cap to cross-registration or to courses that one can cross-register for?"
1617,i will try taking it online this winter just to see if cs is for me. it’s nice to hear you’re enjoying your classes at harvard! 
1618,...wait wait wait.  how has harvard not had a muslim chaplain before?  we even had a humanist chaplain at some point (not sure if he's still there).
1619,"> and hardly any — well under 1 percent — attend schools like harvard and yale that accept less than 10 percent.

why would they even mention that other place?"
1620,"congratulations! i'm sure you are incredibly excited to begin school as you should be! i finished up a master's last year, so i can speak to the experience as a grad student, albeit on a slightly different schedule and far shorter timeline than you'll see as you pursue your ph.d. here are my thoughts: 
   
1. one challenge with answering this question is that you didn't state what you'll be studying and since harvard's campus is incredibly dispersed throughout cambridge, it's hard to give you precise suggestions. as an extreme example, it's roughly a [30 minute walk](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/john+g.+wolbach+library,+60+garden+st+ms-56,+cambridge,+ma+02138,+united+states/harvard+innovation+lab,+western+avenue,+boston,+ma/@42.3727972,-71.1308142,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e3776c9a6f8f65:0x66319a9a21855456!2m2!1d-71.1276599!2d42.3815243!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e377602b41553f:0xfdc59254062cc57a!2m2!1d-71.1241457!2d42.3640707!3e2) from the wolbach library to the harvard ilab. there are dozens of places, both on campus and just off campus, for coffee and food and the best options will be dependent on where you live and are spending most of your time. each academic area tends to have only 1 or 2 actual on-campus locations though, so you'll likely find yourself venturing off-campus. some of my personal favorites: coffee and sandwiches at darwin's (locations on cambridge st & mt. auburn st), food and drinks at cambridge common, burgers at shake shack (no in n' out, but it'll do), breakfast at zoe's, healthy-ish food at b. good, pizza at angelo's, waffles at zinneken's. oh, and since you're from california, people are going to tell you that the mexican food in boston is good, but it's not. it's pretty bad. yes, even ana's and felipe's. i found that mexican, and for that matter any other cuisine that uses a lot of spice (indian, thai, etc.) to be pretty bland in boston. get your fix while you're still in burrito-heaven!  
  
2. harvard has a couple of athletic centers, with the largest being malkin. i purchased a yearlong pass, but i ended up not using it very much, preferring to exercise outdoors and explore cambridge/boston while running and cycling.  
  
3. i also moved from california and this is the question i feel most competent to answer, having made this move myself. things you'll need: 2 jackets- one waterproof jacket that you can wear in rain/snow and one down jacket that will keep you warm. you can find some brands that combine both into one jacket, but i preferred the ability to layer. at least one pair of good waterproof boots. i had some cheap ones and the first day that i had water soak through and had cold, wet feet was a terrible one. gloves, a scarf or two, wool socks or socks designed for boots and the cold, a beanie, and something to keep your ears warm if you aren't going to wear a beanie. i also bought long johns that i could layer under jeans if it got really cold. while i didn't get them, i'd recommend at least one pair of water-resistant pants that you can wear for the really cold, rainy days.   
honestly, i would wait until you're in boston and then go to some clothing stores to pick up clothes if you aren't in a rush. it will be easier to talk to salespeople to figure out what you need and it will be fewer items of clothing for you to ship out there in advance.  
  
4. harvard has a crazy number of libraries. [73, to be precise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/harvard_library). this all depends on your study style. i was personally a silent-floor-of-the-library type of person and would go to different libraries that had silent floors. study at least once in the main room of widener library. it's like something out of a movie.  
  
5. i lived in a house i found on craigslist, which worked out phenomenally, so i can't speak to this as much. i had friends who lived in cronkhite, so i can mention that briefly, but don't know any of the other graduate dorms. the biggest pro to cronk is that the students living there had some of the strongest bonds and social networks of all of my classmates, by virtue of living in the same place. the biggest con, in my opinion, is that the meal plan was mandatory and students got pretty sick of the food after a while (even though i thought it was great when i visited!). there are common kitchens, but we all know using a dorm kitchen isn't like using a kitchen in your own apartment.  
  
hope that's helpful and enjoy! you're going to have some amazing years ahead."
1621,"we have a crazy pool. blodgett is the best in the northeast, over in the recreation campus. yeah campus, the place in enormous. indoor track, baseball fields, the stadium, full tennis courts, squash courts, weight rooms, everything really. 

housing- use off campus services if you want to work it out but there are tons of apartments owned by harvard that you can rent from the university and have it added to your tuition. 

http://huhousing.harvard.edu"
1622,"harvard square is *full* of food.  some of it is even very good!  i graduated a while ago so there's new stuff now, like food trucks in front of the science center.  you will not be allowed into undergrad dining halls, by the way.

no idea whether the gym/pool/rec centers are good or not.  i didn't really go.  the gym was fine for my uses.

winter clothing, ok.  so.  i'm from florida.  i have three jackets: a light jacket, a medium jacket, and a heavy jacket.  light jacket is basically just a windbreaker, useful if it's 55° like right now.  medium jacket is useful from the 40°'s to the 30°'s, so much of fall/winter/spring.  heavy jacket is for anything below; it's a big puffy ski jacket.  i think there are other choices, but that's what i have.  i have a wool hat and some gloves in my heavy jacket's pockets.  i don't wear scarves.  same kind of pants all year round, same kind of sneakers, too.  (i'm a guy; my wife does things differently, i think, though she sometimes borrows my jackets.)

good places to study will depend on your style -- likely, though, your office is where you'll want to study.

didn't go to harvard for grad school, but living off-campus is probably not a bad idea.  however, i know rents have gone up in cambridge and somerville, so maybe it's less good now."
1623,"current law student here. others have made good points already, so i'll just add a couple things. 
> 2. does harvard have a nice gym, pool, or recreation center?

i know there's some kind of recreation center, but there aren't too many pictures of the interior online.? 
hemenway is supposed to be the graduate student gym. it's on the law school campus, so it''s mostly law students, but i do see students from the other graduate schools there. it can get pretty crowded, and you're lucky if there's an open treadmill when you walk in between 7-8am or 4-6pm. the weight area can get pretty cramped as well. i haven't been to any of the other athletic facilities, so i can't speak to those.
> 5. have any of you guys lived in graduate dorms? i believe there are four buildings to choose from. which one would you recommend?

i live in one of the gropius dorms, similar to richards or child hall. while it cannot be beaten for price or convenience, i'm literally living in a concrete box. the standard rooms are just over 100 ft^2 so it can get claustrophobic at times. also, there's no air conditioning, and only one window, so it's miserable in the heat.  it also bears noting that you share a kitchen with several floors, so cooking is also a hassle."
1624,"1.  you're near harvard square, which has every type of food you can imagine.  if you're at the business school, it's a hike.  if you're at kennedy, or law, or gsas, you're there...

2. yes.  hemenway, malkin, and others.  they're only useful in the winter, imo.

3.  get a convertible jacket and a light rain jacket.  something like this will do you.  https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/mens-jackets-vests-3-in-1-jackets/mens-thermoball-snow-triclimate-parka-cnw2?variationid=0c5

1639,"harvard, the wealthiest university in the world, needs to simply stop taking $550 million/year in federal money. then they can break title vi of the civil rights act all day and all night. hell, make it 0&#37; asian if you want. no more ""unlikable"" and ""low courage"" asians.

the idea that a powerful university grabs that much money from taxpayers every year and then destroys records that allegedly prove illegal activity against some of those very taxpayers should enrage all americans."
1640,">it is safe to say harvard admissions will be changing at some point in the near future.

not necessarily 



because the supreme court has a doctrine called stare decisis, which means they try not to overrule their previous cases unless there is a compelling constitutional reason to do so"
1641,"it takes a really long time for things like this to make it to the supreme court, and even then there's no guarantee it'll decide to hear the case at all.   
   
on the other hand, it's entirely possible the current system is not permissible even under the current state of the law, so harvard will lose earlier and scotus will never touch it because harvard wouldn't want to appeal for a possibly worse result."
1642,anthony kennedy single-handedly saved harvard from itself. 
1643,"harvard resists transparency in their admissions process on the grounds of ""trade secrets"". sffa v. harvard has managed to uncover some documents such as proof of the asian ""personality"" bias but much remains redacted. meanwhile, several  highly competitive universities including princeton and stanford have destroyed admissions data as a response to the harvard v. sffa lawsuit.

you are right that harvard doesn't need the money. but that isn't a relevant metric. harvard is the most prestigious and richest university in the world by any metric. it is less about need than it is about position and standing. harvard could increase it's class size by 10x with no-to-minimal decrease in standards (and given the high tuition rates - little to no decrease in profitability).

edit: why over half a billion a year in taxpayer funds should be diverted to harvard, when it clearly chooses prestige over maximizing public utility, is a topic that will be voiced with increasing frequency. it's just such an easy argument."
1644,"tux is probably the only oddly harvard-specific thing, though i'd err on the side of more business attire, since lots of events (both college and off campus social) are quasi-formal. 

definitely invest in a good parka as well. "
1645,"try the harvard boxing club! we’re almost all beginners when we join, and you can get to meet a ton of people from the other schools too. you can come as often or as little as you like to practice as long as you pay the club dues - in my time we had some varsity athletes train with us in their off season too"
1646,"hi sorry for the late response, i think they do have recreational sculling open to anyone with a harvard id, and if you’re here in the school year i’ve seen oars for all the different grad schools, so i think you could row as part of something in any grad school, though i’m not exactly the best person to ask!"
1647,"dang, that sounds rough. but they'll look great on a resume. i had actually been considering georgia tech's online ms in cs back in the day, but couldn't resist going with harvard extension school in the end."
1648,"first off, congratulations! echoing off what gdavtor said, harvard is filled with people who love to learn for the sake of learning. the university draws in some of the most curious people on earth. 

while there is definitely a ""nerd"" culture on campus, it is probably not as prominent as at school like mit. 

hope this helps.
again, congrats."
1649,does harvard have a lol club?
1650,"i'm vaguely involved in harvard esports (hespa), but they're a great organization and stream lol, melee, and other esports! i think they have a facebook page if you want to check them out."
1651,"hia10, doesn't this seem a little strange? so harvard had a bad year with its investments. its endowment is still sufficient to host however many graduate students it wants. this just seems like an overreaction.

i would love to see harvard's budget. i understand all the schools are allocated funds independently, so the college doesn't dip into the gsas funds, and harvard extension has to be self supporting and isn't subsidized by the law school, etc. but even so, it is really hard to believe that reducing admission by 4.4 percent for grad students is going to make any difference.

all investment portfolios occasionally have bad years. it is the way the capital markets work. but when your endowment is as big as harvard's is, there's just nothing to worry about."
1652,">but even so, it is really hard to believe that reducing admission by 4.4 percent for grad students is going to make any difference.

if they cut back in the social sciences, humanities, soft sciences, and fake sciences, they'll quash the unionization bug for good. likewise, they'll kill momentum for the increased radicalization of the student body and the ensuing dissection of harvard culture and tradition. this is a big change, potentially. 


 "
1653,"as a former fop steering committee member who has friends who have participated in and loved all the programs, here is my admittedly biased perspective:

fup is a fantastic program for learning about engaging in social justice issues at harvard and in boston, which, as someone noted, is totally doable without doing fup.  fap is an amazing gateway into the arts community.  dorm crew is great for making some cash before starting school.

fop is peerless as a more holistic orientation to life at harvard.  not only do you come into opening days with a tight group of friends you spent an incredibly fun week bonding with in the woods, but also the leaders are specifically trained to give foppers tools to navigate the fast-paced and often stressful transition to college.  by facilitating reflection, building self-awareness, and creating a safe and open space for people to just get to know each other and chat about their hopes and fears for a week, fop provides a solid intro no matter your interests or background.  

see the annual report for testimony from past foppers, leaders, parents, and the dean of freshmen: http://fop.fas.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1175937.files/finalpdfuzzycheesecake2013.pdf"
1654,"congrats on getting into harvard!! i signed up for fop but due to a knee injury in july, i couldn't go on the trip. one of my roommates did fup and the other did fop. a bunch of friends did dorm crew, and i know enough of people who did all three programs.

having missed out on these programs, i can tell you that you don't miss out on too much. if you want to do one of the programs, then it is probably going to be fun, and your choice won't matter ultimately. if you are an extroverted person, then you will have no problem making plenty of friends. the nice thing is that these programs give you an opportunity to meet like-minded people, which can be helpful during the transition to college, especially if you feel that you are shy, introverted, etc. if you want to do one, whatever the reason, pick something that you would genuinely enjoy. 

moreover, if you want to earn some money and meet some cool peeps, dorm crew is great. (i know people who need to do it for money, and rich students who didn't need to, and did it anyway, so you shouldn't feel hesitant to do it in any way!)

that said, i think that fop gives you an opportunity to explore the outdoors and go on a camping trip in a relatively safe way, which is something you may not have the time to do for again. you will definitely have the time to volunteer through pbha and there are lots of arts programs during term-time. if you miss out on fop like i did, you can join the outing club."
1655,"that said, other programs have financial aid comparable, percentage-wise, to what you're getting from harvard."
1656,just to clarify- are there any extra hoops while purchasing? anything specific i should do? since they are to be returned to harvard at the end?
1657,"i'm in cs, but i took a lot of liberal-arts-ish classes during my time at harvard. later, when i was working at various tech companies, i was amazed at how often my experience forming a coherent argument and (especially) put it in writing came in handy. whether it's a project proposal or a report on your work or just an informal email or slack discussion, the ability to make your case with words goes a long way, even if the issue you're discussing is purely technical. 

i was also amazed at how many people with cs backgrounds couldn't do this. some had never written anything in college. there was one person in particular i worked with who did something cool technically and was asked by his manager to write up what he did so that others could learn from it and see how important it was. he absolutely couldn't do it. he simply had no idea how to explain something in writing. as a result, his work had less impact on what the company was doing than it should have."
1658,"go to stanford if you are sure you want to do cs. although harvard’s cs department is good and you can take classes at mit easily (i did), the entrepreneurial/techie spirit here is probably not as good as that in stanford."
1659,"if you want some wikipedia rabbit holes to go down: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:history_of_harvard_university

also this is a bizarre thing that was frighteningly commonplace not only at harvard but all ivies, seven sisters and swarthmore.

1661,"sounds interesting, i’ll have a look. it reminds me of the long term psychiatric study that was done on various harvard freshmen, and then continuing all the way into their adult lives years after graduation. john f. kennedy has been revealed to be one of the former participants, and the records of his specific responses to all of the questions asked will finally be unsealed in 2040.

1662,">immoral things

i mean, if you want some of the worst set aside some time to skim through beckert and stevens' work on [harvard and slavery.](http://www.harvardandslavery.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/harvard-slavery-book-111110.pdf) nearly thirty-forty years after the emancipation proclamation, the university was still working with slaveowners and profiteers abroad in cuba on sugar plantations. i've been told that harvard initially attempted to suppress faculty research on the subject, but that's hearsay from historians at my school working on similar research.

this stuff can honestly be a bit depressing unless you're invested or interested in history. since i don't like talking poorly about schools on their subreddits, i'll toss on my personal opinion that my school's engagements with eugenics and slavery might actually be worse."
1663,"despite the titles of the articles, wikipedia said the list of schools were: 	harvard, mount holyoke, princeton, radcliffe, smith, swarthmore, vassar, wellesley, yale.

5 of them were/are women’s colleges."
1664,a [discussion](https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/04/08/brown-prepare-off-campus-fall-semester-plans/) about this is underway at brown currently. not sure about harvard.
1665,"they are currently starting to prepare faculty for it, but obviously no decisions have been made. i would say if testing rates haven't improved (including a test for antibodies), there's unfortunately a decent chance. harvard was one of the first to switch online and i believe will be playing it safe to return to campus as well. they already have made the call to have summer school be online."
1666,harvard never seemed to care much about brown and i doubt it will in this instance either.
1667,"yes, there are definitely a lot of opportunities for global health and health policy at harvard! there's actually an entire department for that and they fund summer programs in global health both domestic and abroad. from what i've seen, it's not that competitive, but also everything got cancelled this year so i don't know anyone who is doing one this year.

a high gpa is definitely possible, given the grade inflation at harvard, but honestly if you do your best, you're going to get the grade that you deserve. i've taken one class that was on a negative curve, but everything else has been very very generous.

i'd say people are happy to be at harvard. no doubt there have been times i've been extremely stressed and on the edge of breaking down, but even in those times, there's nowhere i'd rather be than at harvard.

i'm sure you'll do amazing and feel free to pm me if you have other questions!"
1668,"i don’t think the ghhp internships are super selective. most of my friends who have applied have gotten one. 

also, grade inflation is pretty rampant at harvard. you should be able to get a high gpa just fine.

i am not very happy here, but i struggle a lot with mental health issues. i also think there are a lot of fake people here, but you’d find the same thing at any top school. 

feel free to pm me with any other questions."
1669,"check out hms and hsph for research opportunities:

1670,nothing at harvard sucks.
1671,"i have a degree in engineering from my undergrad (industrial engineering from a large state school). in general i find that the engineering mind set is very valuable (analytical thinking/ processing and the like) but in terms of jobs very few of my friends actually got engineering jobs. working in a bio pharma company, engineers who actually use their degree usually cap out early and we like to hire people in those spaces with lots of experience at relatively low levels. using that frame work, it’s not that i think harvard is bad at engineering, it’s that *actual* engineering itself is a difficult field to get into and not as rewarding as your work to get there might suggest. even graduate engineer friends at mit are not trying to do engineering but rather something more analytical like consulting. 

as your entering college it’s something to keep in mind that you might not actually “engineer” things but go into other fields like project management or consulting. fields that need analytical thinking. if your keen on that than no where is a bad place for engineering."
1672,"i studied mechanical engineering and graduated class of 2019. i would argue that it was an even smaller school when i was there (10th anniversary was just a few years ago), but i still found the education and job prospects quite promising. it’s true that many people don’t go into the industry, many apply the skills to consulting or other industries, and some go to grad school. i personally work in the field and my experience is based on the ~30 mechanical engineers and handful of other concentrations that i got to interact with, and we were a pretty close bunch, so i’d say if you’re interested in studying engineering don’t stop because it’s harvard. if anything, the smart people and work class professors make it a great place to study a hard discipline. biomedical engineering in particular is pretty strong there and more people study it. i came in bioengineering focused at first, but found that i wasn’t interested as much in the chemistry, mostly the mechanics, and many biomedical engineers were premed, (though i’m not sure what percentage roughly because i didn’t know too many)."
1673,"harvard does have a strong and demanding [undergraduate biomedical engineering track](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/bioengineering/undergraduate-program)! the department has a lot of very big names, including jennifer lewis, david mooney, and kit parker. i have a few friends in the program, and they all did cool work and have big plans for after graduation.

not saying it's the best program around; mit, northeastern and bu have great bme too. but coming here wouldn't mean giving up on your dreams, not by a long shot.

you might have been hearing people complain about electrical and civil engineering, areas for which i will concede harvard is not the best place."
1674,\#25. imagine if it didn't have the harvard name.
1675,lol your major doesn't matter when you go to harvard
1676,yup! a lot were harvard students
1677,"grades are essentially arbitrary.  when i was an undergrad i took ec 1011a, and i got a solid a on my first midterm with i think a 78 out of 100, while my friend who got a 54 got a b.  the super math genius who was in the class got an 86, i think?  maybe i got a 76 and he got an 88.  something like that.  this was... a long time ago, so i may be misremembering.  but grades at harvard aren't numeric because they're arbitrary and subjective based on how the professor views mastery of the material."
1678,yeah but it’s not until visitas. you get a free shirt that says harvard with your class year underneath

1687,"fellow classmate,

if you feel as though you have to prove yourself, good! tell them what you got out of your education. why would you want someone to assume your accomplishments based off the university's name anyways. take all this place has to offer and make yourself an amazing person.

secondly, let me reassure you that you are a student at none other than harvard university. your school color is crimson and your degree will read the same as ours. if it is the classes that makes a student, you attend the same classes. if it is the admissions that makes a student, you've proven yourself with your own means and determination. if it is the school that makes a student, here at harvard, tell them you belong to harvard extension school, a school of people who have full time jobs on top of their education, of military service members who cannot stay in one place, of students from the most diverse demographics in the university. and i would add, that i'd have it no other way.

if you're studying on campus this semester, 

welcome home."
1688,"the vast majority of hc and grad schools are not threatened by hes grads , usually the claws come out on reddit thanks to that sweet anonymity. i don't need hc and grad school folks to ""approve us"" being here. fuck that. we work hard wherever we come from and show up on campus to kick ass, else we'd not have made it so far as to be admitted. 

on the flip side, hes grads do not need to go around acting out of pocket , narcissistic douchbags that make hes look bad. unfortunately   when hc grads are going around, oh , i don't know, involved in high stakes sat fraud or money laundering, the entire school doesn't get a bad rap. but a hes grad conveniently dropping the ""extension"" part from their degree is front page news. we have to tread carefully. 

seriously especially on this forum the ones who hate hes the most are not harvard affiliated what so ever. it's a tired argument. enjoy your time as a harvard student."
1689,"many of my peers at harvard are only here because of the selectivity. they place their entire worth, and value of their education, on the school’s admission rate. so it’s not surprising that they treat those admitted at a rate higher than 4.5% that way."
1690,">harvard's 12 schools that grants degrees, albeit one that admits differently.

that's an understatement.  4.5% of applicants were accepted for the 2023 class.  anybody can take extension school courses, the barrier to acceptance is completing 3 courses with good grades.

the reason you feel this way is because the schools are different.  when people think harvard they are thinking of the top of high school classes around the country/world.  the extension school does not reflect that.  that makes you feel like you're less than.

&#x200b;

which is a personal problem that you need to work out.  seriously, this is such a weird thing that people seem to get hung up on all the time here.  i take extension school classes.  they are fun, challenging, and varied.  they have some great teachers (and some bad ones).  same as any other school.  just go enjoy your fall classes.  nobody, including you, will care about what the tag line on your resume is 5 years from now."
1691,"this post is wonderful and important.  i'm a graduate student at hes and can relate to your feelings.  i think the quality of education i'm getting is amazing, and i love that it works with my full-time work schedule.

i don't live in boston, and i'm actually planning to visit the campus for the first time in october, so i cannot speak to any first-hand experience when it comes to conversing with students in person.  however, i do frequent this subreddit fairly often to see what's going on, and i've seen the stigma against hes.  i've never really understood it.  if harvard wanted us to be different from the other 11 schools, they wouldn't give us student id's, library access, on-campus classroom access, and the same degree as everyone else.  period.

sure we took an unconventional admissions process, but we're getting an unconventional educational experience for it, and it's amazing.  wear your hes colors with pride, because they're the same colors as everyone else."
1692,"throwaway because i never post on reddit. 

you are a harvard student, point blank. the ""extension school"" or ""continuing education"" concept is not unique to harvard, and hundreds of other colleges confer degree programs through the distance study or non-traditional delivery model. do you think a student who has a degree from columbia cvn (columbia's online degree programs) graduates with a columbia cvn degree? no. they're a columbia graduate. the same is true with upenn (having recently launched an online bachelor's degree), johns hopkins (engineering for professionals), cal-berkeley (ms in data science), georgia tech (ms in cyber/ms/analytics), and many many others. 

often times, as a society, we are hung up on the idea of exclusivity. admission to harvard college is, and always will be, a sign of prestige, hard work, and dedication. however, you have to remember the world is changing, and democratizing access to a high-quality education is crucial to forward progress. 

if people ask where you go/went to school, say harvard. or say a school in cambridge. or don't say anything at all. at the end of the day, most people don't care. the ones who do are just projecting their own insecurities. 

context: mla '17. i attend the harvard club routinely in ny, go to alumni meetups, and have used my harvard degree to secure director-level positions at fortune 500 companies. i haven't met a single person within the harvard community who looks down at hes the way you describe. most everyone is proud of the diversity in students and scholars across the university."
1693,"imposter syndrome is common at harvard, and not just in hes. imposter syndrome is also a problem at mit, hbs, and college.  there are a lot of online resources for dealing with imposter syndrome, but the thing you should know is that you are not alone. i remember some really good ted talks on imposter syndrome that you can find with google."
1694,"i am currently in school at hes. i know it's not traditional harvard but i do not mind and no one else seems to care. 
in fact i feel like being a non traditional student garners as much respect as attending normally does. this happens partly because people don't understand the process in great detail, but also because me being in school at harvard as a 29 year old means that i self identified as a harvard student and am making the sacrifices necessary to attend one of the best learning institutions on the planet. if you don't feel worthy, that's on you. your peers, your coworkers, your family and your subordinates all respect you and admire you for attending harvard."
1695,"you take classes at harvard, but i’d put you more in line with the online class and certificate student. it’s just 100x harder to get in the college, business,law and medical school and these are the schools that make harvard so prestigious and known"
1696,"you’re not part of the harvard community either so your opinion doesn’t matter. let me break it down for you. someone who gets into college will have worked hard for 4 years for a 4.0, 1550+, and multiple high impact extracurriculars and multiple international awards. someone you gets into the extension school only has to pass three classes, which anyone with half a brain can do so. there’s a reason people from extension lie and drop the extension part, because the quality of the extension program is magnitudes lower than the legit programs. all extension does is dilute the harvard brand just to generate some extra money."
1697,"i didn't mean disrespect. i know each of harvard's schools are different and varying levels of them. as for the 2023 class, i was trying to speak more broadly, not about hc specifically.

i guess what i'm getting at is i'm not trying to say i'm equal to certain students. 

i'm trying to say that i want to feel like i belong here, that's all.

which you're right. is a personal thing."
1698,"while i understand that there are schools in harvard like hc, hbs, hms and so on are tougher at the gate to get into...

i think saying i ""take classes"" is a bit...unfair. i'm going to get a degree. i had to work hard to be admitted as a degree candidate. this campus/university is where i will graduate...i'm not here for a couple of credits for the year so i can transfer to a different school. i've been on campus for almost 3 years. 

saying you ""just take classes"" at the university that will issue your degree and that you'll graduate from is diminishing as can be.

i wouldn't expect anyone from any other university to view it like that."
1699,"we're even in the same graduating class! it'll be hard for someone to say you ain't real harvard wearing that cap and gown. when you look across the yard that day in may, i'll be there too!"
1700,"my harvard id and are indistinguishable from anyone else on campus so your opinion doesn’t matter.
let me break it down for you, someone may have gotten perfect grades and killer sat but so what, many applicants have that especially at the higher end. so what’s their hook? money? fame? race? i guess now that applicants can pull their admission file they can see for themselves.  anyone who got in obviously deserves to be there. but i’m secure knowing that me and my peers earned our way in. no backdoor $7 mill donations from us. no cheating scandals. no memes. 
no one is dumb enough to say that hes and hc are the same. they’re not. the brand is strong enough to support other goals and missions, and your gate keeping attempts are what bring the brand down. we should be hating yale, not other schools within harvard. 
 but you clearly feel strongly about the matter. why don’t you bring up your points with bacow. with your solid arguments, i expect to see hes shut down by the end of the year. until then, how about we all stay in our lane."
1701,"but it’s not “any other university.”  it’s one of the most selective undergraduate programs in the country. hc classes and experience is different from the hes experience. you still will have a harvard degree and you should be proud of that, but it is disingenuous to pretend you’re the same type of harvard student as a member of hc 2020."
1702,"hey if you really want to be a real harvard student, then get good grades in your extension classes and apply to one of harvard’s graduate programs"
1703,"your harvard id looks different, i believe, but how is that even an argument? harvard college is one of the most selective colleges in the world, its easier to get permitted in extension school, but extension school serves a different purpose and provides a lot of value. i think you get more for your money at extension school."
1704,"the only reason hes isn’t shut down is because it’s a money farm lmao. just to clarify, hes is part of harvard, but more along the lines of an online degree/certificate program and should not be compared to hc, hbs, hls, hms, etc"

i'm perfectly understanding that there is a difference. i'm an undergrad under a different school of harvard university - definitely not harvard college. i'm glad there is a distinction because if there were not, it would diminish the differences between students."
1709,"i wouldn’t call it a school of harvard. it’s more like an online program except it’s in person. basically, it’s just a program using harvard’s name. until the extension school actually becomes selective like harvard’s actual schools, i won’t consider it part of harvard.

edit: to elaborate, if you want to feel like you’re an actual harvard student (not just the name, but part of its esteemed student body) you should have applied to the college or one of its other graduate schools"
1710,"i'll just say i appreciate the input even if it doesn't align with harvard's own views, both students and faculty. the responses here have helped, though.

/u/millionairewaltz \- don't feed the insecure trolls, i hire hes, hc, and gsas folks for a fortune 500 based on their individual abilities and resume, not the perceived esteem of their individual schools within the gates of harvard. 

protip: the value of a harvard degree has nothing to do with the admissions process in the eyes of this hiring manager ( and all of my colleagues for that matter ). why would it? if you can perform exceptionally at school and have that performance reflected in your gpa, nobody cares about the hc or hes selection process."
1713,"lmao everyone downvoting me is an extension student. real harvard students don’t have time for reddit anyways. to a hiring manager, the prestige of the extension school is probably comparable to the likes of ohio state at the best"
1714,try applying to goldman sachs as an extension student. for sure you’ll be treated as a real harvard student
1715,nah fam i'm downvoting ya; and btw real harvard students do use reddit lmao.
1716,"they are already working there, and mckinsey, and morgan stanley.

i’m genuinely curious about where you are getting your data. don’t believe me, just pop over to the harvard club in nyc and you’ll meet hes grads working in fintech, banking, it and engineering at goldman, mckinsey, morgan stanley, etc."
1717,"you don't understand the truth. you are giving one opinion, and i will give you the benefit of the doubt because i don't think you have worked in the real world yet.  seriously, the only people i have heard your ""opinion"" are insecure harvard college kids or people who never attended harvard. i think you should hang it up, because i think you are the former. 

/u/millionairewaltz- this person is just a troll and not reflective of the harvard community."
1718,"you were at harvard for one summer, hardly makes you a real harvard student, though i’d say you’re more legit than an extension student"
1719,those are the professionals who actually use it for continuing education. those who go to the extension school just to try to get the harvard branding never make it to those places
1720,"you’re not part of the harvard community either, so your opinion doesn’t count. to put it into perspective, to get into harvard college you would need a 4.0, 1550+, and multiple high impact extracurriculars. to get into the extension school, you need to pass 3 classes, which anyone with half a brain can do"
1721,"sorry to burst your bubble but i, unlike you , are an actual member of the harvard community. you obviously don't know about extension or hc. if you did you would know that the majority of people who try to enter hes do not make it. and there are people in hc who do not have 4.0's or 1550+ sat's. 

 you may live in your delusional world, but please keep your mis informed ""opinions"" to yourself."
1722,"ahh... there it is. you believe that athletes, urms, or legacies are not as qualified. your snobbery is showing. do you think that a black person who graduates from harvard is not as qualified as a white person? that their degree will be looked on as less ? 

snobbery and elitism have no place at harvard"
1723,actually by competitiveness of admissions it’s harder to get into harvard college than many of the phd programs
1724,didn't the author literally go to harvard?
1725,"pretty sure mfa is free all the time with a harvard id. same with all the harvard museums (to which you can also bring one guest for free). it's free to go on the uss constitution along the freedom trail too, and that's pretty sweet.  improv boston in central square has a pay what you want standup night on sundays i think. i went once and it was pretty good."
1726,"not that i wished that i knew about it sooner because it's the kind of thing you learn about right when you need it, but i loved the easy silver line transport to the airport - very cheap (and it is free if you are coming from the airport). no need to get an uber. 
all the harvard museums are pretty decent, too."
1727,with harvard id there is a great print service.  i had colored posters made for 69 cents each.  10 dollars each at staples.  [http://www.hums.harvard.edu/print-services](http://www.hums.harvard.edu/print-services)
1728,"i think there's no harm in avoiding a class if that's what you want to do. there's no reason to take a class you don't want to take. if you're worried about time and grades, those are both valid concerns. with that being said, if you do decide to take 124 and struggle through it with your classmates, that might be an experience you'll really value afterwards, and there's also no harm in getting a bad grade here and there. (i know that as a harvard student the thought of getting bad grades probably makes you uncomfortable and we all feel that to some extent, but there's a lot to be said for taking the class which seems to be a staple of the cs department here even if you'll have to grind through it and may potentially get a b)."
1729,"124 is a fantastic course, definitely very challenging but i found it to be very rewarding. and jelani was an excellent lecturer, far better than most other harvard courses i've taken. it will help a lot if you have some experience going into it -- would highly recommend buying the clrs textbook and doing practice problems (textbook problems, or usaco) either before or alongside the class. but the professor is changing next year so maybe the course will change too."
1730,"while certain arguments here certainly warrant attention, i feel like he is arguing that all students at selective colleges and universities have some sort of deep-seated inferiority complex constantly looming, governing all our thoughts and actions — something that is probably true in some cases, but does not resonate with me personally or with many people i have met. sure, maybe there is a hierarchy built into people’s minds, but in any case it is more of a rough outline than a strict ranking, as we all know, and my personal opinion is that i have not felt the need to publicly validate myself by comparing harvard to other schools.

that being said, as i write this i realize that deep down i believe that harvard would probably be at the top of my rankings if i were to really make a “hierarchy”. not for his reasoning though, probably more because i genuinely love the school. still, maybe i’m a hypocrite, and he isn’t *so* wrong after all."
1731,"well, this reads like an apologist article if i've ever read one. 

i'm a harvard grad from nearly 20 years ago. i studied economics and work in finance. i'm happy to report that my peers from harvard are significantly smarter, harder working, and more interesting than most other pools of graduates (particularly those of penn).

my favorite anecdote of this (and its true) is from my training program at then investment bank i joined out of harvard. the bank taught the program in modules, then gave tests after every week or so long module. the first module was accounting, which, as a harvard grad i had no experience. after the test a snivelling graduate of wharton-penn came over to ask score i had gotten on the exam. upon hearing my score, she exclaimed, ""i got the same score as the kid from harvard."" 

i congratulated her on having only taken two years of accounting at wharton to achieve such a feat. both her reaction to the respective exam results as well as those results themselves convince me that most of the stereotypes we have about those other universities are based in more than a grain of truth.

some of the greats:

“pekinese! pekinese! arf arf arf! eli yale!”

“what’s the color of sh*t? brown! brown? brown!”

they’d also sing self-derogatory versions of harvard songs in the glee club:

to the tune of our director:

“we’re a bunch of bastards,
scum of the earth!
born in a cat house;
sh*t on, spit on, kicked around the universe!
of all the dirty bastards

we come from harvard
the asshole of the earth!”

there might be more, but those are the only ones i can think of now. 

"
1738,"when harvard puts running water in every dorm room, this won’t be an issue. until then, it’s still convenient as hell to order bottled water or a water cooler delivered to your dorm so you don’t have to go to the single group bathroom on your floor that most freshmen have to use."
1739,"from my three years spent here as an undergrad i would agree with the characterization that harvard isn't especially outwardly elitist. i don't think anyone would disagree that the stereotype stems from a time when harvard wasn't concerned with diversity or even absolute merit. students during those times were probably also more outwardly elitist, which stemmed from the fact that so much of the student body came from the same areas and the same background, and by comparison students are extremely diverse both geographically and economically, and outward elitism has died off almost 100%.

with that being said, i still believe that there is some more subtle elitism that manifests itself in discussions about which college is best or who is credible in any debate. 

in any case, the vast majority of the idea of harvard's ""elitist"" culture is simply a relic of the past, when that was a more accurate description of the student body, just as you stated."
1740,"it's a stupid stereotype that people who don't get in buy into. the school doesn't want them, so they rationalize that something must be wrong with the school.

ironically, elite standing--which is *the* very aspect of the institution that they covet--is the same aspect that they hold in contempt.

i enjoy interacting with members of harvard's community, because they're some of the most engaging, passionate, and genuine people around. no one feels they have to act snobbish in order to prove their worth."
1741,"agree 100% on the subtle elitism point. i'm at the law school now, but grew up in nc, where i went to public schools all the way through college. this often elicits some sort of reaction that is either elitist or terribly out of touch. lol i told someone the city i was from, and they immediately asked if i went to this $40,000 /year private school growing up. nah. it's really hard to articulate how exactly the elitism manifests itself, but it's everywhere at the law school. i don't necessarily attribute this to harvard, because i suspect other ivies are the same way. regardless, the ""harvard"" brand probably empowers elitists more than other schools. 

 "
1742,"that's an interesting comment, particularly the ""subtle"" form of elitism that i might have missed. is it different from what you'd generically call ""school pride""? is it different from the good-natured ribbing harvard lobs at yale?"
1743,"hi mike,

yeah, i went to law school in the late 90s, but i was at university of texas. there *were* some pretty elitist attitudes there too, and i think that's just law school culture. i never could figure out why people acted the way they did - i remember thinking: why do these guys go around provoking each other all the time - don't they understand that these are their future colleagues and people they'll get case referrals from?? and this was back in ye olden days when grading in law school was a real tyranny. didn't grok civ pro in first year and blew a c on your transcript? no summer clerkship for you. and wave dreams of being a law clerk on the circuit after law school farewell...

what i can say for sure - if it's any help - is that people do finally figure out that all politics is *truly* local. and cheer up - many accounts from my profs who went to harvard law before the a - f grading system knew its days were numbered had it much worse then. :)"

for coordinators of event: next time please write ""for harvard college undergraduates only"" if the event is only for college students rather than ""for harvard undergraduates only"". 20+ harvard undergrads showed up that were not allowed in because you did not distinguish between extension school undergraduates and college undergraduates which are both harvard undergraduates. "
1745,"> i know for a fact most harvard students will be wildly skilled in all these departments, putting me at a severe disadvantage.

heh.  no.  they'll be just like you.  don't worry about it!  you will almost certainly be with a few people much smarter than you (unless you're those people yourself), but most everyone else will be on the same level.  just don't procrastinate too much, i guess.

> for those of you who also moved from far away, how did you find adjusting to the environment at harvard?

you should have money.  it sounds like harvard provides everything you need.  it does not.  you may want to go out, for example, or buy things for your dorm.  you'll want to buy books and supplies.  drinks from the soda machine.  stuff like that.  you don't need a lot of money, but you do need some.  obviously, getting a job on campus will help with that, but you'll definitely want to come with some or you'll find yourself unable to do basic things like take the t or attend events with admission.  again, we're talking enough for basic necessities here, not being rich.  you don't need to be rich!

as for coming from far away, you'll definitely want to have a warm jacket and a medium jacket, at least.  and you may want to call your parents every so often?  is it that hard to call your mother?  she poured her blood and sweat and tears into raising you and *this* is how you repay her?  ...sorry, i have jewish parents!  but it's really not a big deal.  i'm from florida, which is pretty far.  turns out i actually like it up here.  who knew?  so i stayed up here after i graduated, and i've been here ever since.  it's nice!  you'll be fine!  soon enough -- as in, like, within the first few weeks -- harvard will feel like home.  you'll go someplace else for the day, and you'll come back and see annenberg and the john harvard statue and the annoying-ass tourists you have to maneuver around and you'll know that you're home."
1746,"was it at freshman orientation where they said that most incoming students think they are in the bottom half of the class, and most graduating seniors think they are in the top half? or was it the other way around? i don't know. 

anyway, since i can't remember, it clearly must not have been that important. 

i'm completely awful at writing helpful comments. congratulations, anyhow. i think the admissions process for top universities tends to create a bit of an aura that contributes to feelings of inadequacy. maybe approach it a different way. harvard isn't some walled garden full of elitist jerks (although we're definitely better than people who go to that school in new haven). the garden doesn't mean anything. it's the people in the garden that are harvard. this includes you now; you are harvard. and you know what? you are great."
1747,"i didn't go to harvard for undergrad, but i attended a selective private liberal arts school on the east coast. i also moved quite far from home and had some initial feelings of inadequacy and concerns about homesickness. 

about the inadequacy - i didn't let that hold me back and i did just fine, if not just as good or better than friends who attended elite private schools. (i attended a good, but not elite, public hs.) don't be too hard on yourself because it's not worth the energy. don't be scared of setbacks such as a c here and there and possibly even a c grade. harvard is meant to be challenging, and you won't achieve perfection, so just keep a reasonable mindset and take pride in your work ethic that got you in the gates.

in terms of homesickness, i'm going to be honest - i did feel homesick the first year, but it got easier and easier with each year. looking back on it, i grew so much and benefited so much from following educational opportunity and i'm still just as close with the most important people from back at home (best friends, family, mentor figures, etc.). that's not to say that you won't grow and change, but that's the point of higher education :)

also, i second that on the bureau of study counsel! since you already have these concerns, you should arrange an appointment with them in the first weeks of school."
1748,"drugs wouldn't get you expelled. sent home for a year maybe, but not expelled. to be permanently expelled from harvard, the ad board has to determine that you pose a threat to the safety of other students and it takes a lot for them to do that. "

(i have only rarely visited before.)"
1755,"i've always said that what works to teach one, may not work for all.  as an hes degree candidate, i find that online-live-lecture style classes let me absorb information faster than any of the other hes methods. when i say this, i'm actually including in-classroom where i do fine, but tend to get distracted.  so while the other 3 commenters don't think it's an ""equal replacement"" or ""comes anywhere near...the on-campus learning experience,"" if it's about the *learning* and not the *socializing* then each student is going to learn differently and we need to account for that.

there are *some* students who absolutely will learn better online, and *some* students who get distracted, *need* the in-person interaction (vs zoom) in order to succeed.  this may be because they get distracted or have trouble separating workflows, like wassukhani (not judging, just using your example).  it might be for other reasons.  and while i agree that peer-bonding is an important part of the college experience, and living in a dorm is a *fantastic* experience, neither of those things count toward a conferred degree from any accredited institution, and peer-bonding can still happen over zoom. after-all, no one in the workforce current cares whether you lived on-campus, off-campus, or commuted to get your degree. if the curriculums for online and in-person are the same, then why should a degree learned online be any different?\*

if anything, as more people work from home, learning online collaboration skills, e-meeting etiquette, and how to follow the lead of someone you've never met in person i think become *more* important than the in-person college equivalent.  case-in-point, one of my clients hired me to set them up for remote working, and is now discussing downsizing their permanent office space because distance-working has made them more–not less–productive (socializing in an office is fun, but it's also a productivity albatross).  it think quite a few companies are going to come to this same realization, and that we'll see a substantial increase in the percentage of america's work white-collar workforce that are working from home. if that happens, the people who don't have the skills/discipline/environment to work from home will weed themselves out.

\*note: the curriculums for hes vs harvard college or hbs are categorically *not* the same right now.  i'm not at all advocating that an hes alb should be treated with the same gravitas as a degree from harvard college."
1756,"i'm not going to disagree with you that there's a difference, because there is.   i will say, though, that those same conversations don't necessarily have to be in person (reddit, as one example - ted talks as another).  and clearly the 'net is going to have a hard time replicating coursework labs... in academia, i firmly believe that whether or not online collaboration will work comes down to the field, professor, tas, and students involved.  in my dozen or so live web-conference classes, i've had some real winners, and real stinkers.  if you're talking about friends that aren't necessarily in the same classes getting together and chatting about coursework over coffee or in a club, that's a little harder, but i'm certain it's still doable. (i've met friends via hes in different fields and we get together and chat fairly often.)

please understand that i'm not at all defending online-only pre-recorded classes (which aren't at all the same), but in a zoom-style lecture setting with real interaction between the prof/ta and students (in addition to the lecture), there's not much to be gained by being in the same physical room.  if there's something i'm missing, then i would argue that vr chat/big screen (or something yet-to-be-invented by a harvard grad that's a bit more advanced) could accomplish whatever's left over except physical touching of one another.

one thing i think is very true is that there are smarter people than i working to make online collaboration better than it is now.  i'm a fan of vr, so i hope that's the way it winds up going.

the ""advice"" part is just my experience... if you want it summed up in song, try ""come out and play"" by the offspring. 😂🤣"
1757,"just thought i’d add that harvard doesn’t let you joint concentrate in ec x gov. only certain departments allow joint concentrations - ec doesn’t allow any and gov allows some with area studies such as east asian studies. you could do one as a concentration and one as a secondary, but that’s about it. i’m not sure if this will affect your decision, but it’s probably good to know."
1758,"while i mainly agree with this, the resources the institution has varies greatly between harvard and yale, so choosing between them is about knowing what resources you'd like to leverage in college. in my opinion, if you're studying gov or econ, there's no better place for it than harvard. harvard kennedy school has so many resources and clubs like the iop have amazing programs for gov students. i'm not as familiar with the econ department, but i know it's up there as well."

1770,"thank you for your answer!

from what i understand (i might be wrong), hes doesn't provide i-20's for non-summer semesters that are not done through harvard summer school as it's not an accredited full-time school. is there any way to take a full-time course load and somehow request an i-20 from hes during the fall and winter terms?"
1771,"harvard summer school is a full time residential program, so it can offer the i-20. there is no way to obtain a i-20 for hes as they do not offer a full time residential program, so the fall, january and spring terms are not available. so, unfortunately, no. you can contact the admissions office and get a more definitive answer."
1772,"if you're confused about analyzing literary passages, i'd consider aiming to place into expos10 so you can make the most of your harvard educational experience. no big deal, my hs also didn't introduce me to this."
1773,"yeah, once you place into expos10 then you’ll be taking 10. it’s really not a big deal though - trust me that you’re going to be able to get all the classes in your four years. also, a sizable part of the student body has to take 10 or they wouldn’t offer the course, so it’s not like you’re gonna be marked as “the stupid kid.” 

learning to write professionally was one of the single most valuable things i gained by going to harvard. honestly, i think taking two semesters would be advisable for most freshmen, because mastering that skill will help you with any concentration.

finally, there’s a hidden perk of 10: you get first pick of your 20 “course,” (not really sure what to call the different options) which you’ll find out is a huge deal. some of your friends will hate their 20 course while others will love theirs."
1774,"hes graduate here. i strongly believe the name ""harvard"" on my resume got me several interviews at great companies. i finally accepted an amazing offer, with fantastic pay, from one of the big five tech companies.

1775,"yes. but you better be able to back it the fuck up with your actual *carpe diem*-ness, hard skills, and intellect. which plenty of (the shockingly few) hes graduates have in abudnance. just be aware that imposter syndrome is endemic throughout all of harvard, but especially in the division of continuing education; as the oldest axiom in the world goes, ""*know thyself*"" and you will come out swinging. 

disclaimer: am drunk but god dammit the hes degree candidates i know are impressive people."
1776,"if you google search this, or even search on this sub, similar questions have been asked before and you’ll find many answers.

to give you a down the middle answer, it won’t give you the same opportunity as someone coming out of hbs with an mba, but it will supplement your current career (depending on what it is) really well. most people that pursue that degree already have careers and so they leverage the degree to move into leadership roles. you shouldn’t have any issues doing that if you’re aggressive with your job hunt or are already in a place where you can bring your new credential to your managers attention and ask for opportunities related to a vertical move.

edit: to answer your original question - i don’t see why not. its a masters degree conferred by harvard university that (and people often forget this) you worked hard for while working full time. as long as you aren’t misleading anyone by saying harvard business school, i don’t see why the “harvard university, extension studies, management” line in your resume wouldn’t carry weight."
1777,"hey op! i’m a current hes student in management and concurrently persuing my pharm d. i accepted a summer offer at a fortune 40 pharma company in med affairs onco. imo pay could be a bit better but they supplemented it by paying for an apartment for the summer. while i feel i am more than qualified for the position, i am convinced going to harvard is what helped seal the deal. 

my advice, pay someone on linkedin profinder to revamp your resume (if you haven’t already) and go out swinging. this summer i interviewed with 5 different pharma companies for 7 different roles before accepting. i did not have this sort of luck before harvard. just to boot, a hiring manager of a role i turned down emailed me to stay in touch as she wants to track my progress. extension school or not, people, especially in pharma and biotech, are super impressed when you have a harvard degree (or are a candidate). in my experience, they are wicked smart people who often clawed their way to the top with science degrees from larger state schools. when they see harvard, they are impressed. 

if anyone else has a corollary to my thoughts, please feel free to share!"
1778,"it does carry some weight. any degree from a well know school will carry some weight and make you stand out from the crowd. if you have the talent , experience and skills to back it up then it carries a lot of weight as it will amplify those attributes. 

you worked in a harvard lab, you have some experience and you worked while going to school. all good things."
1779,"it’s totally a legit degree.  you not only have to bust your ass to stay in the program; it’s no cake walk, but people outside harvard don’t really care about the extension part at all. to a lot of people they don’t get the difference between gsas and extension, at least where i teach they don’t. 

bottom line, it’s solid and not just something harvard gives out like candy."
1780,"i was thinking about joining the program myself. it seems a lot of this sub thinks that people who go to the school try to pass themselves off as harvard grads, which they are, but try to make it seem that they went to the regular university and hide the online part. i really don't care about that...i want to go to the best online school that i can possibly get into, and it seems that this school may offer the best masters i can get online. can you let me know what you think of the program. also i was thinking of whether i would have to relocate, or if a couple flights a weekend would allow me to attend the parts that you have to be there in person for."
1781,"i have no desire to hide the extension part of the school on any resume / application and will follow the schools official guidelines for listing my degree. anybody who does that it bogus!

but i also don’t feel like i went to “harvard” so i’m curious how the work force will view it."
1782,"“hide the online part.” huh? 

degrees offered through hes can be completed entirely in person. some courses are available only in person, others are taught live with room for distance students (which were the bulk of my courses). very few classes are comparatively offered entirely online only. i had a few, one was a taught by a vp from tesla. 

some schools you can graduate without ever stepping foot on campus, right or wrong, but that’s not the case at hes.

all our harvard ids look the same."
1783,"it doesn't have the same cache as 'real harvard,' but it's a plus, especially if (as is your case) you have a ba from a traditional program and went back to hes targeting a specific skill set."

1785,"i know exactly what you're going through. as a senior, it's a realization that i've seen many people around me stumble upon. harvard isn't a ticket to success, and you will need to work very hard here to get what you want. the kids going to goldman/ms/jpm/etc, in most cases, arrived here wanting to go into banking/trading and did the necessary prep and networking to get there. same goes for prestigious software companies or top consulting. people seriously underestimate the difficulty of getting these internships and joke about high finance/mbb consulting/faang as if those companies are begging you to work for them. 

this belief in the power of the harvard degree ends up hurting a lot of freshman and sophomores who realize too late during junior year that many doors close if you don't have the right gpa, ecs, previous internships, or simply if you started too late (like finance recruits over a year in advance now i think). and unfortunately, those who figure this out too late are all too often students who come from families and backgrounds not exposed to this stuff. i get it man. it sucks, and i had to go through this. 

at the end of the day, you are, as a harvard student, in a better position than kids from most universities. if you are still trying to find an internship for this summer, keep applying around, but be aware that most job portals are black boles. have a good cover letter template that will allow you to to get those apps submitted as efficiently as possible. consult with ocs and your peers if you think your resume is not the best it could be. 

to maximize chances for work this summer:

1) use linkedin and the alumni directory to find harvard alums, especially those in your hometown, who might have an opportunity, even an unpaid one. connections are the single easiest ways to get internships, and many harvard alums are very generous.

2) consider trying to find a research opportunity with a professor here. you didn't specify your concentration, but if it's anything in the sciences, you can very easily contact a couple professors and organize something for this summer. funding can come from hcrp. even if you aren't in the sciences, you can still find research positions in the social sciences or elsewhere. doing this is much better than doing nothing. professors won't vet you like companies will.

i was in your boat, ended up doing research with a professor, then worked my ass off to pull my gpa. i'll be heading to a mid tier consulting firm (one tier below mbb) after graduation, so things didn't work out so bad. you've got this."
1786,"what year are you? some companies just might not want an 18/19/20 year old working for them. i'd be willing to bet that a lot of those people interning at goldman or wherever had some kind of hook or had been building up to it for a while. harvard will open doors but it's not an all access pass. 

think back to when you got in to harvard in the first place. it took some work and focus, didn't it? you'll need to repeat that for internships and later on, jobs. i know you can do it or you wouldn't be where you are. "
1787,"i chilled at home summer entering soph year 😎

which honestly isn't too bad, i wouldn't go gung-ho trying to make money or whatever at this point when 1) you only have so many free summers left 2) you don't have many skills to apply anyway

try to go abroad or something, harvard gives out so much money for that. i didn't do this but i know a few friends who studied abroad practically for free. from what i know boston's nice during the summer too but why not try a new place?"
1788,"i don’t think it’s that man. i think it’s just that money shouldn’t really be the reason why you do anything once you go to a school with financial aid program like harvard’s. of course it helps to be able to pay bills, get groceries, invest a little, and buy some nice clothes and shoes and stuff, but freshman summer especially shouldn’t be dictated by money in many people’s eyes, including mine. if that’s cause by them having a kind of disconnect to the value of a dollar idk, but for me at least it’s just more of a “do whatever is most fulfilling” regardless of the $$ attached now that i’m guaranteed affordable schooling."

1792,"i can't speak to others' experiences, but i was on full financial aid at harvard and graduated with a higher net worth than i started with, thanks to decent term-time jobs and a good internship before senior year."
1793,"100% of harvard college students can graduate debt free.

[https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid](https://college.harvard.edu/financial-aid)"
1794,"they can now. but some alumni have debt from before this policy existed, and harvard doesn't pay it down retroactively.

then there's grad student debt."
1795,i can't access my harvard email anymore - one day it'll automatically deactivate so i'd recommend migrating anything important on there.
1796,"if you are an alumni, as in graduated with a degree, then yes you get a permanent email at alumni.harvard.edu."
1797,i thought it was @post.harvard.edu
1798,"it used to be, for a long time.  post.harvard.edu has been discontinued.  those who have them can keep them, or choose to migrate to alumni.harvard.edu but all new alumni emails are issued alumni.harvard.edu."
1799,"if they give harvard the money directly, it will be used toward room/board/tuition etc and not for personal expenses. i do think, however, that harvard allows you to allocate excess scholarship money for certain expenses (like buying a computer or flights) your first year. 

your other option is to talk to the scholarship committees and tell them that they'd only be helping harvard's endowment instead of you if they mail harvard the money. they might agree to work something out. "
1800,"i actually dealt with figuring this out myself - harvard requires you to report all educational awards, whether the check is mailed to you or to them. in theory you could fail to report a scholarship to them if the check is mailed to you, but i’m unsure what the repercussions would be if they found out. according to their policy, any scholarships beyond the student contribution (besides up to $2k for a laptop freshman year) will reduce your harvard grant 1:1.

in a case with no outside scholarships, harvard seems to usually expect the student contribution to be used for unbilled expenses (plane ticket, etc). the scholarships will replace the student contribution, so in theory you should be able to use the money as you would the student contribution. 

in my case, i have a small tuition bill remaining even after financial aid. i’m going to apply all my scholarship money towards the tuition, and will simply be frugal with living expenses. i’m unsure how your situation would play out, but i highly suggest you talk to a financial aid officer about this."
1801,"i'm not entirely on faust's side about final clubs, but she did have some good points in her letter. 

what a lot of people don't know was that there was a similar debate about 100 years ago at harvard. at that time, many faculty and leadership in the university thought that harvard was becoming too much of a ""rich kids club,"" as the socioeconomic barriers became very pronounced at the college. this is the main reason the barker center was built originally. it was meant to be an affordable eating club/dorm for students of lesser means. the houses were even conceived partially because the college wanted all students to live in an academically-tied house as a response to increasing student apathy towards academics. all of the issues of class division and academic apathy seemed to stem from the exclusive social scene. 

from this perspective, i definitely agree that final clubs are contributing to a campus that is less focused on academics and more on social status. this isn't a new problem in harvard's history. to me, it is today's incarnation of what was happening 100 years ago. i don't like faust's language of ""diversity"" and ""inclusiveness"" because it has so many nasty connotations from far left college groups (like evergreen state college fiasco). however, i do believe that she is right to point out a problem and attempt a gradual solution."
1802,"i was just a standard good at hs math person who did well in ap calc bc.  i started off with math 21a and did fine.  linear algebra was tough, and i think moving beyond that would have been hard for me.  my impression as a non math concentrator was that people in math 25 and higher often learned beyond hs level math before coming to harvard. "
1803,i will be done with cal 3 (multi) and linear algebra ... but it won't be harvard level lol. i've done some proofs and such at a number theory program. i'm just not an olympiad person or anything... and i don't want to get lost in a sea of those sorts of people.

1805,"we have an h already above columbia from a previous attempt at the word harvard - you can see it at 925,937.  it's pretty much in a shield already, but we can make it a little taller if we want?
"
1806,"i chose harvard over princeton. i mainly did so because i felt like the culture at harvard fit my personality better. when you're talking about hyp+, there are very few differences academically (at least for undergrad), so usually the decision comes down to how well you feel that you fit in.

i can say this: the english department at harvard is truly fantastic. it is one of the best concentrations here. i am not an english major, so i don't know first hand, but everyone says that harvard's english department is best of the best. it's also super friendly and small. i also probably don't need to remind you that the crimson is one of the best (if not the best) college newspapers to write for. 

with regards to your questions: no, i would not have chosen differently. i am very happy with my experience here. that said, i probably would have been very happy at princeton too. some things i don't like are  that the housing is hit-or-miss (some of it is great, some not so great). however, the university is in the process of renovating all of the houses, so this might not affect you. 

harvard has a really great community and has lots of very unique traditions that you won't find elsewhere. for example, one of the main reasons i came here was because of the housing system. among hyp, harvard is in the best city, in my opinion. "
1807,i'm also curious if there were any cross-admits with columbia - what made you choose harvard in the end?
1808,"i completely agree with this. i chose harvard over several other schools because of the environment. harvard manages to be large and diverse enough where you can find people to get along with while also not being overwhelmingly large. 
the academics are honestly on-par with most similar schools, but many of the resources available are much better. harvard has a lot of money to give to students for all kinds of things. it is extremely generous in everything from financial aid to extracurriculars and study abroad. 
hope you get to join our community! "
1809,thanks. what aspects of harvard culture made it feel like a better fit for you?
1810,"princeton, to me, felt hypersaturated. there is little in the surrounding area, and so the university community completely dominates the student's life. at harvard, i liked that there is a fun and exciting community outside of the university bubble to interact with. not to mention lots of other universities nearby. "
1811,"obnoxious is in the eye of the beholder, and that's not been my experience with anyone at harvard. but i don't think the statement is intended to be literally true though. writing about and discussing sports occupies this odd status in our society in which suddenly people who are ordinarily serious as a road accident can be hyperbolic and irrationally opinionated as they want and it is deemed normal. even the most reserved actuary can make statements about predicted wins or losses with no statistical backing and he or she isn't taken as foolish because it is in the context of sports. you get a pass for rooting for the bad news bears if it's your home team. so his opinion of harvard undergrads has just been brought in front of the fun house mirror for this discussion."

1816,"endowed positions, and not unique to harvard. it is also not unique to professors; many coaches are similarly titled. e.g. tim murphy is ""the thomas stephenson family head coach for harvard football."""
1817,"in general, having a chaired professorship > not having a chaired professorship.

at hbs, (tenure-track) associate professors are mostly chaired, but i'm not sure this is the case with other schools at harvard."
1818,"does the endowed position mean that someone paid harvard to sponsor that person to become a professor, or just a type of position you can get?"
1819,"if someone donates a lot of money to harvard (or any college) in the form of an endowment, they can specify how that money is spent in perpetuity; harvard can only spend the returns on the endowment, so an endowed chair needs to be sufficiently large so the gains can cover a full salary. (the endowment itself cannot be spent - it’s an investment.)"
1820,"hello fellow physics enthusiast! 

i'm not sure i fully understand your specific question(s), but i'll give it a go. 

i'm currently a 3rd year phd student studying physics at harvard. on that note, i know there are plenty of ways for undergrads to get involved with research and tour labs here at harvard. even just emailing a professor (or grad student) of a group you're interested in and asking for a tour/to meet up and chat is an effective way to get answers to your questions.  it sounds intimidating, but in general we're so happy to share our knowledge and experience since few people actually choose physics. so when we find interested people we try not to scare them away. 

masters vs phd. in the states, not many people apply for and get just a masters degree. usually it is a step along the way to a phd that you get for completing courses at the graduate level. sometimes (i'm not sure how often, i've heard for all phd programs across all subjects the number is as high as 50%) people will drop out of the phd, but stick around long enough for the master's just to kind of get something for the time. if you are in a master's program, generally you are paying tuition - i'm not actually sure about income though. for a phd at almost every school the school will pay your tuition and give you a livable stipend. the trope about 'struggling grad student' is an exaggeration in most cases, depending on your spending habits. but the income is certainly less than if you took your bsc straight to an industry job. but keep in mind you are also getting 'paid' in the form of tuition coverage and, at the end of it all, a degree.

in other countries (specifically canada where i got a masters) there was a research component + thesis, and i got paid a livable wage and tuition paid for. 

since you are a freshman, i don't think you are limiting yourself by doing physics at all. physics is so broad that if you find a particular love for computer science (for example, or bio physics, or astro, or even wall street risk assessment) you can tailor your degree to include more of those courses. then near the end of your degree you can decide if you want to focus on making a portfolio and not do a phd, or continue in academia. my friend from undergrad ended up doing this - and when i met him in first year he was dead set on a phd. that's kind of the beautiful thing about undergrad, you can take a range of courses and the find the fit the works for you and you are excited by. 

feel free to ask more questions, or ask for clarification. 
also, if you're at harvard currently, we could meet for coffee and chat!"

1823,"it changes from freshmen year in the harvard yard mail center to the address of the mail room of your upperclassmen house starting in sophomore year. for the three years you live in an upperclassman house, the address stays the same."
1824,"i'd like to think that it's a correlation, not a causation. competitive programs attract many applicants, so they can take on exclusively the most promising grad students, who are more likely to become strong researchers, who then find tenure-track faculty positions. going to a competitive program means little down the road if you're not productive in your field.

having access to the resources that a place like harvard provides doesn't hurt, however."
1825,"there are two questions:
1. do you have a better chance of becoming a professor *at harvard* if you have a ph.d. from harvard.
2. do you have a better chance of becoming a professor *anywhere* if you have a ph.d. from harvard.

the answer to #1 depends a bit on what you mean by ""professor."" if you mean a tenured professor, the answer historically is no. in fact, the reverse is true: harvard traditionally likes to hire faculty who have spent part of their academic careers elsewhere. (in contrast to mit, which likes to hire and promote its own phds.)

the answer to #2, is not necessarily. it turns out that when a department is considering hiring a recent ph.d. graduate, what matters is not the overall reputation of the university where they went to grad school, but the reputation of the *specific department* they came from and the *specific professor* who was their thesis advisor. for example, if you want to get a ph.d. in polymer science, case-western is apparently the top-rated department in the country. for philosophy, boston college is rated higher than harvard.

so the best thing to do if you want to get a ph.d. is to find the program that's the best fit for your interest. ideally, if there's a particular professor whose work you know about and are interested in, then apply to the grad school where that person teaches."
1826,"this question somewhat dependent on the discipline: 

[a 2015 paper in science advances found that some 80% or so of new tenure track faculty in computer science graduated from the top quartile of institutions.](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/1/e1400005)

[a 2003 study published in chemical and engineering news determined that only a handful of schools accounted for the majority of chemistry faculty positions at top-10 schools.](https://pubsapp.acs.org/cen/education/8139/8139education1.html) among males, harvard accounted for 4.1% of all tenure-track positions, the largest of all schools and 2.8% of all professorships at top-10 schools (both genders), ranking third. 

you're not gonna hurt your chances by attending harvard. if you choose cuny instead, say, you are still likely to receive a great education, do great research, but biases amongst faculty might require you to explain your decision when seeking a ladder job."
1827,"broadway by prescott is probably the closest, but both small and $$$. central square has whole food, h mart, target (very limited). better luck out in porter, which has star market. there is a trader’s joe by the stadium in boston.  if you want best bang for your buck, go to market basket in sommerville. 

ps: harvard has free on-demand evening shuttle to central sq, the stadium, porter and anywhere in between. i have used it a few times to go to and from central"
1828,"harvard is a better place to explore your interests, both in and out of the sciences. 

if you’re already set on doing math/cs/physics/other core sciences and don’t need/want exposure to other areas, mit is probably better.

edit: also, harvard college students spend more average time on extracurricular activities than  students at any other college. i don’t know the exact stats for mit, but i presume that a lot of free time goes into degree-related research instead of other activities."
1829,"harvard is a better name brand (and, in my opinion, a prettier campus). plus, regardless of what school you attend, cross-registration is pretty easy. mit has a more egalitarian social scene, however."
1830,"i've noticed that most harvard students come out well-adjusted and able to engage/socialize with pretty much anyone, but a lot of mit students are not as good at socializing. i feel as if mit does not put as much emphasis on introverted becoming extroverted (understandably so), but harvard there is more of a pressure to become extroverted."
1831,"harvard's much better for humanities, so if you want to explore anything outside of stem, it's better. it also does have great science programs in its own right, and they're especially pouring a lot of money into the cs department right now.

backgrounds are so varied that there’s no typical one. people had every major. some were straight out of college, some had been consultants or soldiers or rabbis or charity founders or paralegals. most were impressive and fascinating.

the website will tell you the average lsat score and gpa of the most recently admitted class, i think. but you can get in with lower scores if you’re more accomplished or unusual."
1836,"/u/wrkncacnter112 gave a very good summary overall. 
your gpa and lsat will matter a lot. a low lsat or gpa is not insurmountable, as hls is large and admissions really does look beyond the numbers, but you will need something compelling in your application to stand out if so. having the right numbers is a very good sign that you will be accepted, unless something in your personal statement or lors makes admissions wary. 

average lsat and gpa numbers are available on hls's 509 forms, and for more information generally on the law school admission process the sidebar and sticky of /r/lawschooladmissions should be your go to.

the majority of students have at least a year of work experience out of college. not all, but most. 

i am near the end of my time at hls and have thoroughly loved it. in addition to /u/wrkncacnter112's points, i've loved going to a ""big"" law school because it supports so much more in terms of activities. i did not come in expecting to love it, but i have made lifelong friends with truly incredible people. going to a school that is not highly ""competitive"" (as compared to other law schools) makes the culture much more relaxed, since you aren't fighting tooth and nail for jobs, so you're less likely to be looking over your shoulder at all times. sure, it's harvard, there's the standard share of assholes, but i've found people to be so much more friendly and kind than i ever expected."

1845,"did they seek you out because of harvard, or because of your following?

if you’re just asking you to make instagram/snapchat posts, that’s not a big deal. even paying you to wear stuff isn’t a huge deal, as long as you like the clothes. asking you to push it onto people you know is where i would draw the line, personally. i’ve done similar arrangements, but made it clear that i would only be displaying the various product and would tell people about it if they asked, making clear that i would not be forwardly advocating their product.

if you think this is normal you forgot what normal was a long time ago "
1848,"at harvard, it seems like “fun” and “inclusive” are mutually exclusive things. what you’ve read is pretty abnormal in the college nightlife scene. it’s all very harvard-esque. fun for some and not for all.

yale’s social scene is way different than harvard’s. it’s not hard to get into any parties there. harvard is very stratified in comparison. it’s kinda sad.

"
1849,"it’s not a house party - it’s the phoenix. yes, the clubs bring girls in from other schools because there’s not actually a huge pool of girls at harvard looking to attend these parties. yes, they invite girls off instagram because they want attractive girls. it’s a club scene, an international norm."
1850,"as a guy who was a member of a club as an undergrad i can say what girls “go through” to gain entrance to a party they want to attend and can attend for free is a hell of a lot less judgemental than what a guy goes through to get past some douchebag bouncer at a nightclub only to then be asked to spend hundreds of dollars. 

don’t like it? don’t goto either and don’t complain. it’s the real world, not just harvard. "
1851,">don’t like it? don’t go to either and don’t complain. it’s the real world, not just harvard.

i totally understand that final clubs are private entities, but it doesn’t make their exclusionary social practices right or just. also, i don’t think it’s productive to *not* challenge or question certain institutions. otherwise, you’ll never inspire change."
1852,"all i'm saying is when put all the cards on the table, meaning these men and women are just horny adults looking for hook-up, everything becomes less shadowy and/or objectionable.

1855,"in april of last year, harvard's president held a meeting at the economic club in washington, d.c. to fret about losing the hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding harvard gets each year. rather than dissipating, the concern is reaching a fevered pitch behind the scenes.

the trump administration's preference is not secret. the proposed federal budget for 2018 called for slashing federal funding for scientific research and education, elite universities which declared themselves ""sanctuary campuses"" faced repeated attempts at withholding funding for opposing federal immigration law, the department of justice backed an anti-asian discrimination lawsuits which if successful would prove a violation of federal law and take away funding, and lastly the president himself is quick to threaten it, as with this tweet  towards uc berkeley's protests against a right-wing provocateur (milo) visiting:

*"" if u.c. berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - no federal funds?""*

of course the government has to prove a violation of federal law to withholding funding from a specific university. and the ucali president was quick to support milo's right to speak against the wishes of liberal students and faculty who don't quite understand there's something more important than moral showboating (money).

all this comes to the third pillar - the public. a populist president can be moved by popular opinion (as he was vis-a-vis the separation of families controversy). but a history of elitism holds them back at the gate, and recent revelations of racial discrimination in admissions and (more damaging) large preferences for legacies, the wealthy, and the well-connected pushes them further back still. if you polled voters today with a loaded question: ""should the extremely wealthy harvard get $500-600m a year of your taxpayer dollars?"" the results would be worse than perhaps any other time in harvard's history."
1856,"hes students who study on campus are still 100% harvard students and eventual harvard alumni correct? its just like going to hbs, gsas etc. if i’m not mistaken."
1857,"this may run counter to a lot of the advice other people have been giving here, but i believe the best thing you can do your freshman fall is to take all required classes for your major and just bite the bullet. what this will do is free up space later in your college career for exploratory courses.

what everyone does is take a ton of exploratory classes freshman year when they have very little info on what courses are good or bad, then are forced into required classes later in college. you know that class that looks so cool to you as a freshman? imagine it displacing the opportunity to take a class as a senior when you have a better sense of what you want out of college and are trying to squeeze out a last few good courses.

of course, there are a few courses every harvard student should lottery for literally every time it’s offered because there’s no guarantee you’ll get them at all your 4 years here. ghhp 60 and sw 49 are classes you should absolutely lottery for as a freshman cause anyone is lucky to get them "
1858,"sure yeah! ghhp 60 is negotiation and conflict management. basically, this is a super famous class at the law school and business school (might even be required) that teaches advanced negotiation techniques. it’s listed under the department global health and health policy for some reason, and that’s why many people don’t discover it until junior or senior year. by everyone’s reviews, it is one of the most genuinely-useful and interesting classes at harvard with a very manageable workload. there’re only 60 spots and around 350 lottery for it every semester, so i’d lottery for this one early.

sw 49 is less universally loved, but i lost the lottery twice before getting it so i’m including it here. it’s sw49 the worlds of business in modern china which is a harvard business school class taught by a harvard business school professor all about how chinese businesses work, how the chinese economy works, how u.s. businesses do business in china, all that stuff. super super practical if you ever wanna do business in china + the class is taught using a ton of case studies which are a good change of pace from standard lectures. this one is dependent on an interest in doing business in china, but it’s again, very applied and practical."
1859,"www.harvardhousingoffcampus.com/property/search

also hotpads is the other best site to check. good luck. use google maps a lot. check commutes with the commuter rail. past 495 is too far. also check epa toxic zone sites. a number of towns are old factory towns that haven't recovered. saugus is a toxic waste dump. best bet is north shore by salem or beverly, metrowest by belmont or arlington, south shore by scituate and pembroke. you can get a discount on the commuter rail pass from outings and innings. also get a library card, all the libraries have free passes for the zoo/ museums. "
1860,"an alternative would be to try to become a house tutor (effectively ras but for the 12ish harvard houses). they don't pay rent, they have free* meals, and they get pretty nice spaces. only consider it if you're willing to do the job though (interact with students meaningfully, effectively).

*apparently it charges the house for your meals, but you'd pay nothing."
1861,"people are more pretentious during visitas, you'll find them even friendlier during the day-to-day when they aren't trying so hard to impress you, and treat you like peers. there are always too many events going on at harvard, you just have to get plugged into what you're interested in. the only thing is they aren't handed to you quite as nicely as visitas events were, you kinda have to seek out events for what you're interested in because there's just so much pubbing going on for so many events! "
1862,"that's a good question. i'd agree that people are generally more friendly during the normal year (visitas *is* right near finals period after all). the harvard experience is really malleable though. there are often a lot of random events that you could never go to and be perfectly happy, but some people have to go to every event related to their interests, and that's okay.  some folks pick classes without wondering about how interested they'll be, and i only pick classes that are as close to interesting to me as possible. there are different communities for everything, so if you find you're not connecting with people in classes, try a club that interests you (but try not to overload, that's something that a fair amount of people do here and it's frankly irresponsible).

to use a cliché: harvard's what you make of it!"
1863,"oh wow! congrats! it's tough, fair warning. harvard isn't easy, but i'm excited for you!"

1865,"the argument is that this goes beyond the allowed affirmative action policies in fisher v. uot. their case acknowledges the ruling and specifies in the allegations that they allege that harvard has gone from legally allowed affirmative action to discrimination.

that being said, this is still a weak case - but it isn't unwinnable."
1866,"> equality comes from equal opportunity.

this is *precisely* the case for affirmative action: systemic discrimination prevents equal opportunity.

universities such as harvard (along with quite seriously every other reputable university) value diversity, so they carefully employ affirmative action in order to achieve a balance of students that, on one hand of the spectrum, are quantitatively the best, and, on the other, students from disadvantaged backgrounds who overcame great adversity to achieve almost-as-good academic resumes. 

basically, affirmative action takes context into account because there's more to a kid than his/her sat score and class ranking. is that not more holistic? how is that unreasonable? "
1867,"> now rationalize why minority students of east asian ancestry should face negative selection.

no one has to rationalize anything. the fact is that the people you  feel are ""inferior"" based on your own privileged world view, harvard feels is superior for building a class. 

harvard wants to build a class that will produce people that can change the world. not people who spend every weekend at princeton review to get their sat scores up."
1868,it is cute you think that extension is not one of the degree granting schools of harvard. i will remember that when i cast my vote for the board of overseers.
1869,"i mean, as long as affirmative action in all its forms has been around (whether you want to call it holistic admissions or what have you), it's attracted controversy and will continue to do so because there just isn't a way to easily level the playing field that has favored white males from time immemorial.  and since the equal protection clause of the us constitution means at any given time what the nine us supreme court justices say it means, then as administrations change, affirmative action will come under greater or lesser scrutiny. it is unavoidable when you're talking about massive resource allocation.

to the extent this debate involves harvard in particular, it's only because it's really prominent on the national scene; ultimately the difference in value to society whether people attend one university versus their next best alternative, is small. because - think about all the people who get rejected from harvard who feel they would have gotten accepted had it not been for affirmative action - what's their next best alternative? let's say they wind up at boston college. now assume some value delta of going to harvard vs boston college (hard to do, i know, but just roll with it...) now sum up whatever that value is for all those people. we're talking about a hill of beans if the scale is against whatever the united states government should be spending its time doing. is this worth allocating loads of government resources to chase this down, versus all the other challenges they have to face?

it's not. there's no way to argue it's even remotely worthwhile unless you want to pin it on a ""fairness"" argument, and then it devolves quickly because fairness is one of those suitcase-like terms that means many different things to different people."
1870,"you would *think* stare decisis would apply, but it's gone to the us supreme court over the years. everyone thought it was decided in bakke, actually, in the late 90s.

the key is that none of the affirmative action supreme court precedents is a blank check - specific guidance has been given as to what is a permissible affirmative action strategy vs what is not. the feds could always be investigating to see, for example, if the way admissions is administered at harvard adheres to those precedents, for example.

even when not directly involved in a case like this, harvard has in the past provided amicus briefs (translates to ""friend of the court"") in which they've suggested legal analysis. while amicus briefs aren't often used, harvard's were deemed of high quality and informed the court's decision in several cases. the reason harvard did this, of course, is because if a bad precedent gets set through one case not involving harvard, that could impact harvard down the road when someone, seeing the outcome of that case, decides to litigate. 

edit: by the way, it's not quite true that you can discriminate however you want just by virtue of being private - if you're a university that receives material resources from the government (think: student loans) - then constitutional requirements pertain."
1871,"standard time slots are 75 minutes long but classes don't have to fill the time, they can be shorter. 

i'll be interested to see the full details voted on, harvard magazine had an article with a lot of the details from the last proposal. it included a bunch of rules for departments to follow, compelling them to spread out the times at which their classes are offered instead of bunching them up mid-day. the new schedule should mean more class choice for most students because fewer classes will conflict with each other.
"
1872,omg this happens so much in the indian family circles...every mom will call me and ask me to tutor their kid so he/she can get into harvard 
1873,"i definitely wasn't talking about standardized test scores, but rather about the lifetime of intellectual curiosity that you need to actually be able to make it.  if you mentor the kid in elementary school and the kid is naturally smart enough, you may be able to instill those values.

no amount of sat tutoring will get someone into harvard."
1874,the sad thing is that it would be really cool to see an active comment section...made up of actual harvard students.
1875,"my guess: malan is pretty awesome, and people the world over get to essentially take a real harvard class.  by ""real harvard class"" i mean that the psets are comparable to the psets from other harvard classes in length and difficulty.  or at least they used to be, i don't know how they are now.

i did the cs50 curriculum in the summer of 2011 -- i'm '06, and at my 5-year reunion i had mentioned to a friend that i was trying to learn programming, and he suggested that i look at cs50.  i did, and it was my primary preparation for a software development job.  i don't code in c anymore, but doing those problem sets -- never mind the trivial lectures; i hadn't been a programmer before but i still knew most of what he was saying from earlier aborted attempts -- was a really great experience.

i did this before edx became a thing.  the videos and psets were online, so i watched them and did them, on my own time.  apparently, it's grown enormously.  i have no idea what it's like now.  i would 100% recommend the version i followed (fall 2010, i think), and i would guess that newer versions can only have improved, but i don't know that from experience."

1877,"mark zuckerberg.  and the professor treats it like a business.  like i'm pretty sure they have their own office space on mt. auburn.  and now he teaches it at yale?  i guess i'm one of the minority who never took it, but i think it's also popular because students realize the increasing role computer science and programming play in our daily lives, and a lot of harvard students are professional resume builders, so they like saying they have the experience.  could be completely off base, like i said i didn't take it, idrgaf"
1878,"hes is a fine program. the issue is that some people who enroll think it will be equivalent to a harvard college degree, which is simply not true. you should only enroll if you genuinely like the hes program and aren't expecting it to be a way to sidestep the rigorous admissions process for the college. "
1879,"i just finished cs50 at hes and it was pretty solid. by way of background, i hold an mba from uchicago and a jd from university of texas, so have experience in elite academic environments. and i would say that the one course i have taken is on par or better than any of my previous academic experiences.

you will find people who obsess over the hes/college distinction, but what seems to be the case more often than not is that they don't have first hand experience with the institution and/or are focused on others' place in the academic pecking order. focus instead on what you hope to accomplish in your studies. it isn't really the institution that makes the students. it is the students who make the institution.

for those who talk about the supposed lack of standards of admission, i would say they lack imagination. it is more of a marathon model. literally anyone can sign up for a marathon. relatively few can complete a marathon (so those who do are de facto elite relative to the pool of all runners). if you complete your degree at harvard extension, then you have run an academic marathon and are as much a part of the harvard community as anyone else.

but these are just my opinions - you have to try for yourself to see if hes lights your academic fire. because it is your opinion that really matters, not mine and not those of the trolls."
1880,"the courses are taught by harvard faculty, and are oftentimes the same as harvard college courses. i think that the stigma comes from the idea that anyone can take hes courses whereas one needs to go through a tough admissions process to get into the college. people don't realize that while you can get into a class relatively easily, you need to apply separately for a degree program; i'm not sure what their admit rates are, but i do know of people who weren't admitted, so it's no barn door."
1881,"the other thing people ignore about hes is that your degree of integration into the harvard community is largely a product of your own efforts. if you take online courses and never make any friends or contacts at the school, are you really making the most of your education? i would say no, of course not.

but if you are willing to invest the time, you can get the most out of the experience. in cs50, i would discuss assignments and lectures with a classmate, we really hit it off, and now we are pursuing a startup using our final project for cs50 as a base. what makes harvard harvard (from a student's perspective) is largely that it is a platform for those kinds of interactions to occur - these interactions give rise to the opportunities for which the school has become famous.

"
1882,"all the talk of a bad reputation should really be more precise. i don't believe and have not experieced that it has a bad reputation. i believe if everyone is honest, the question everyone is really addressing is whether or not an extension degree is the same as a harvard college degree. it isn't. with respect to the undergrad degree, however, there was a time a few years ago, perhaps still, when one could probably have taken all harvard college courses to complete their extension school bachelor's degree.  i never counted them all and cannot swear to this, and don't know about today, but it is an interesting thought. one certainly could take many hc courses.
but to the question of bad reputation, i ask, compared to what?
as i was working on my alm i often came across discussions in which posters were trying to find out the graduation rate. we never did find out, but i am graduating in may, so it happens. the extension school programs are excellent. be prepared to work. by the way, cs50 is both excellent, and a harvard college course.
as an extension student, one does not have to have an excellent prior academic background. do not make the same mistake as the earlier poster and conclude that this proves that extension students must not have those excellent backgrounds. some definitely do. there are many reasons that a person with exceptional abilities might not have attended an ivy. many older stduents appreciate the opportunity now to study with some of the best academics,  enjoy the rigor, and yes, don't mind that the harvard name is attached.
it's such an odd discussion. at oxford there are claases of degrees. there are a few part time advanced degree programs and even a small number of online master's degrees. they are simply called oxford degrees.
anyway,  for me the program was convenient, inexpensive, the best online presentation at the time...back when online programs were mostly text in a bulletin board, rigorous, up to date, and relevant. but everone has different needs.
"
1883,"> why is there such as negative opinion of it (from what i've read). 

people accuse harvard college of ignoring academic standards in their admissions process, over accepting legacy students.

whereas hes only considers academic standards (in taking 3 courses and finishing with a b average).

i guess you just can't win, can you?"
1884,"i wouldn't be enrolling because i would be using it as an equivalent as harvard college. it does seem like it is a good program, though."
1885,"> if you complete your degree at harvard extension, then you have run an academic marathon and are as much a part of the harvard community as anyone else.

you also get a harvard alumni card, and can participate in the harvard commencement, and attend the harvard club (along with all other alumni benefits). 

so once you graduate, there's no difference (edit: according to harvard - still one of the 13 schools of harvard).

i feel the harvard vs hes stigma is mostly good-natured ribbing when someone didn't get the memo."
1886,"ruthplace, you are on to something - the reason the discussion of ""stigma"" lacks precision is because no one asserting that said ""stigma"" exists has one scrap of measurable evidence to back that up, so it fits somewhere in a nebulous no-where-land that can't be subject to verification.

i have followed these discussions online in my spare moments, and it is difficult to say that an undergraduate degree from harvard college and the same from harvard extension isn't ""the same"" in every measurable way, in part because you can't even compare graduates of harvard college to other graduates of harvard college. how would you make this comparison between graduates of hc in humanities vs. computer science vs. geological sciences, for example?

higher education has struggled with this measurement issue forever - the best stab i've seen at quantifying differences is the college scorecard, where they compare costs, student debt levels, and employment stats. (i did try, just for fun, to get pooled data from harvard college vs. harvard extension - but guess what - harvard university combines the data when they report, so that makes differentiation difficult.)"
1887,i don't think the claims that harvard college ignores academic standards in admissions have any merit. nothing about their published statistics suggests this is even plausibly true. 
1888,">once you graduate there's no difference 

that's not quite true. there are plenty of differences. an hes degree carries far less weight than a harvard degree, for example."
1889,"> there's no difference

the only meaningful difference, aside from the obvious (prestige) is true of any harvard school: your progeny only have priority at the school you actually attended."
1890,"dkennemo you are measuring too many things. the op asked about how a hes degree is viewed. if i suddely viewed breathing as hazardous to my health, that wouldnt make it true.
but people mean different things when they enter into this discussion. some mean that hes students were not chosen for their previous accomplishments,...true, some people appear to be saying the program itself is poor...untrue, some debate the relative market value of the degrees, and i believe they are different.
""proving"" what people believe seems to me an impossible task. stacking the degrees up against each other could be done but sensible criteria would have to be chosen.
but again the question was along the lines of ""what do people out in the world think of this degree""  and i have no idea how to answer that. the idea that any degree from harvard could have a stigma seems ridiculous unless it was some sort of comparison between the two"
1891,"tell that to the asian americans with perfect scores. 

remember when harvard had a jewish problem? it's so easy for us to forget our own history:

http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/harvard.html"
1892,"> you also get a harvard alumni card, and can participate in the harvard commencement, and attend the harvard club (along with all other alumni benefits). 

"
1893,"let's do it! the subreddit haw been quiet, but harvard people are...well...busy."
1894,"the “prefer not to say” option doesn’t make much sense to me for an anonymous survey, and i think it is misleading because it’s biased in one direction (wealthy students). there’s a lot of first gen/low-income pride on campus, so i don’t think those students would necessarily be ashamed to report themselves as such, but i know quite a few students from wealthier families that are really uneasy talking about money. my guess is they’re the ones choosing “prefer not to say”. this is just my hunch, so i could be wrong. 

it’s also interesting how the article says “harvard is predominantly white, straight, wealthy, etc.” without acknowledging harvard is actually less white than it would be if races were represented proportionally (in the u.s.) and more queer as well. so while that statement is technically correct, it feels a little loaded."
1895,"6 years of data isn’t long enough for a real trend at harvard. also, inflation over the last 6 years is about 10%, so 17% of class of 2022 had a 2016 income of 450k+. not a huge difference, but it’s conceivable that a couple percent of the harvard class is right there. 

i think the jewish population is just sampling error, though it’s possible that harvard has been changing their race and ethnicity admissions policies due to the lawsuits. 

mental health is greater access and societal trend."
1896,i think it’s much more likely that over 6 years harvard drastically decreases the number of ethnic jews it admits than that decrease over 6 years in the number of ethnic jews who are religiously jewish
1897,ask mit students; they’re better at sneaking around harvard than any of us lmao

1899,the harvard smithsonian observatory is only open on the 3rd thursday of the month to the public but it’s pretty much right across the street from cabot.
1900,the observatory on top of the (harvard) science center is open to students too.
1901,"i did not take a class but i was good friends with two people who did. if you are interested in stem research, i would definitely recommend the course, but with caution. they teach you a ton of material which means you will gain a huge body of knowledge on biology and chemistry. in non-corona times, they spend so much time perfecting their lab technique that you will be way ahead of your peers in the rest of the stem department. obviously during online classes a lot of value is lost from this course.

the training you receive in this course will prepare you to succeed in any stem profession both practical and theoretical. the course will also prepare you for some of the most difficult courses at harvard, because the work ethic required to succeed in ls50 is no joke.

this brings me to the huge con of taking ls50 which is that it is all consuming. this course will define your freshman year and honestly yourself to an extent. you will always be working on the course, and will not be able to give a lot of time to much else. 

there is a huge pro which arises from this con, however. you will become thick as thieves with your classmates. because it is a small class size and the problem sets are so difficult and time consuming, you will be constantly working with your peers in order to succeed. you will come out of that class experience with a solid community of life science experts who have shared a struggle with you. 

if you love a challenge, you are extremely committed to a future in stem, and are prepared to work your butt off and dedicate your time fully to this course, then by all means take it."
1902,"had a friend who regretted taking it because of the time commitment, even though she went on to medical school. if you're just interested in getting practical bio research experience and you want to do so for credit, i would recommend ls100 instead; i did freshman year and loved it, got really useful experience of what wet lab research is all about from benchwork to grant proposals, and am now in grad school for biology.

as a bonus, two pieces of general advice:

* the best place to hear what past students think of a course is https://qreports.fas.harvard.edu, not reddit 

* before you start a career in bio research, think carefully about whether you're willing to spend your time maiming and killing mice (or rats or chinchillas or axolotls or zebra finches or zebrafish) because if you don't talk about this with your mentors in advance, you will more likely than not end up in a situation where your project suddenly requires it and you'll feel like you can't back out or pass it off to someone else, even if you're not ethically comfortable with it."

1904,"i’m not at the ed school so i can’t speak to their aid but there’s no danger of the online format decreasing the value of the degree.

edit: online format is terrible and no way to get an actual education, but hgse is harvard and the diploma will still open doors. besides, online is only temporary."
1905,"i'm in the gse program and i'm 99% about to drop because i don't think the online degree is worth it for the specific ed career i want to go into. for you it may be beneficial, but for me the main reason i applied were for specific internships, cross registration with hks and hbs, and connections/networking in real time and that is not happening atm. students from this year (class of 2020) talked about how online wasn't comparable to in person classes.

they opened up the online degree because they predicted new admits would drop since they aren't allowing any deferrals or tuition reduction, just a part-time 2 year online option as the only alternative. they want your money plain and simple argh. there is already a school wide petition going around to get the school to be more flexible during this time. this school has already disappointed me in more ways than one, unfortunately, just from not being flexible. however, they seem to be working hard to have a better online experience but current admits are being scah-rewed.

however a harvard degree is a harvard degree and it may be beneficial to you despite it being online! ask yourself why you really want to go outside of just the name.

edit\*: they still have internships that coincide with the classes but it's remote and they encourage you to find internship work in your own community."
1906,"eh, if you have the dough, the time and want a harvard diploma , sure it's ""worth it."" long term benefits? i'm not sure. it's the field of education. a good percent of masters in education are a waste where only a handful of graduate schools are worth it at the end if you're paying out-of-pocket (i.e. harvard, upenn, stanford, ucla) given the poor roi.  the name of harvard will no doubt open up some doors that a local university offering a similar degree will not have, but depending on what you want to do that local university may be much cheaper and may serve its purpose for your aspirations. 

the questions you should be asking yourself are -

1. what is the purpose of this degree in relation to my career aspirations?
2. will this degree help me become the professional i want to be?
3. will this degree take me where i want to be as a professional?
4. what will be your research focus? does this particular harvard gse program meet your research needs?

>education consulting

what do you mean exactly by this? at what level? if at the primary and high school level you're going to need classroom/school experience. a good majority in education who do educational consulting as an outside agent are either former classroom teachers or are in the discipline of educational psychology who are mostly licensed school psychologists."
1907,"most of the big classes are for the first two years because of introductory/gateway courses to provide you with a solid basis for upper-level courses. most of my classes in junior and senior year had fewer than 10 people, some classes were four people or fewer as well.

if you put in the effort, you can really have close connections with both tas and the professors. this isn't a unique feature of harvard but it's more likely that some of the big people in the field you're interested in will be teaching at harvard. additionally, i found some close mentors in a field completely unrelated from my degree, and really enjoyed branching out into the liberal arts education that harvard does well.

it's difficult and you won't always be happy (it's really not for everyone), but i am very grateful for the wealth of experiences i had. i don't think i would have had the confidence to try out other fields if not for going to a liberal arts college."
1908,"i graduated... a while ago, so i don't know how things are right now, but yeah, there are some big classes... and you can take small ones instead if you'd prefer.  introductory lecture classes are almost always pretty big and almost always taught by the professor, and then you'll have smaller sections once a week with the tf, and that's when the actual discussion happens.  there *are* some classes taught by tf's, but at least when i was there, that was limited mostly to basic math courses like multivariable calculus and linear algebra, probably because it would be silly to have a 300-person lecture for math classes and sillier still to have it be taught by a professor when pretty much all questions can be answered by undergrads anyway (i was a course assistant for these courses one year).

anyway, the appeal is that everyone is very, very smart, so the work you'll be doing is very, very difficult (well, not in the basic math classes, but you don't go to harvard because of the *basic* math).  even in classes taught by tf's, the professor is the one who actually makes the assignments.  and you generally have the option of taking something harder and deeper if you want.  don't want to take the basic math courses?  take the advanced ones.  or the honors one.  or the advanced honors one (look up math 55).  you may want to only take that one if you're competitive at the international level.  most schools don't have anything like that; you'll take the basic ones and be happy with them.  equivalents exist in other fields, too.

i'm of the opinion that there are many schools where you could get an education fairly similar to the one you get at harvard; harvard is not unique.  but it *is* at the top when it comes to the qualifications of its students, and the courses are geared to the people who take them.  you'll be expected to do higher-caliber work at harvard than at schools with less-academically-inclined students.

that said, many times i wished i'd gone to mit instead because of its residential system; i'd have been so, so much more social.  eh."
1909,"not at harvard but at penn. was browsing this sub because of the discussion to lower fall 2020 tuition if it goes online. the appeal in places like harvard and penn is that they give you a lot of resources to leverage if you know how you want to do that. the issue is that not a lot of 18 year olds really do know how to do that lol. it's also a place where you can meet like-minded people that inspire you, push you and can open doors for you but just like the resources available to you, you have to be proactive about getting after it when it comes to networking. also, it's a place to challenge you if you so make it. you can come in from high school thinking you're hot shit and when you leave you have a pretty good sense of where your strengths and weaknesses lie which is a great thing to know for success in life because you have a clear indication of where you should focus. the downside is that the grind can wear you down, the comparison of self to others is an omnipresent factor, there is a pressure to be successful along traditional career paths which manifests in pressure to go into obviously prestigious jobs like consulting or finance. curious what others have to say."
1910,"absolutely this. i was in big classes my freshman year. by sophomore year i was in at least two courses taught directly by tenured professors who i still keep in touch with (and those were both outside my concentration). by junior year i took a tutorial lab course for chemistry where i was taught by the dean of undergraduate research in chemistry, and he paired me on a project with ej corey (this was my concentration, and much like taking a class on writing and getting work with stephen king or maya angelou if you were an english major). if you’re smart about the courses you choose, you can absolutely get personalized attention. 

and that’s just in classes. outside of classes the house system is very conducive to making lasting friends. we’re scattered all over the country now, but my blocking group and another we became friends with as juniors are still very close. all going to each other’s weddings, being godparents to each other’s kids, and making time to hang out annually (this year that’s been a challenge because of covid-19...). 

now for the negatives. i know just as many people who hated harvard as i do people that loved it. but that’s life."
1911,"agreed. after largely semi-fucking around my first two years at harvard, junior year i woke the fuck up and realized i wasn't taking advantage of anything here. that's when i got serious about things like doing research, forming strong relationships with faculty, seeking friends and people who would expand my thinking and engage in delightfully interesting conversations, getting to better know the faces of my house, etc. i really didn't know what i was doing my first two years. you can completely skate by here and no one will notice.

and yeah, the challenging academic environment is a real trade off between pushing yourself, learning things quickly and rigorously, and unhealthy, relentless self comparison with people who are talented beyond belief. personally, i've never been able to find ways to cope with this in a healthy way.

luckily, in my experience, the pressure to go into consulting/finance was not a big deal. in fact, i found that a lot of people i know are going into those careers reluctantly, e.g. their real passions were in science/history/etc but they wanted to make money and not go to grad school."
1912,"i like your response, and you’ve got to do you; however, i think we’re going to see a new “normal” emerge out of this and i don’t think anyone can “absolutely ensure” anything close to the old normal right now.

we’re all lapsing time in ‘wait and see’ mode right now, might as well get an education while we’re broken, then go see the world once it’s recovered.  there’s really no reason you can’t take a gap after college before working.

finally, once you’ve been out of college for 10 or 20 years, you’ll have some memories and maybe maintain some awesome connections, but you’ll realize how little those 4 years really matter (the harvard diploma matters, but no one not-harvard will even ask what house you were in).  as a 22yo graduate, those 4 years are 18% of your life.  once you’re 44, it’s only 9% but the years-after-graduation are 50%.  food for thought."
1913,"i know the importance of a college experience, and the sympathetic side of me agrees with that. but that isn’t why anyone should be going to college. it’s not worth the money. you can get fun and life changing experiences for far less. now if you make the argument that op would be missing out on academic experience because of a lack of online resources, labs, libraries, etc. well that’s a different story. but taking a gap year because you won’t get to live in a freshman dorm seems vapid to me. 

and for the record, i was a z-lister. i’m a big proponent of gap years. i’m also now a high school college counselor, and the trend of people wanting to defer a year is creating a ripple of craziness throughout the college admissions world and high school juniors. the wise choice would be for all colleges, harvard included, to push back their deposit deadline to june or later (within reason) as some schools have already done. so much more will be known (not everything of course), and people should be able to make a better informed choice."
1914,"i'm pretty sure they will cap the # of gap year students for financial reasons because they need tuition payments (this may not be as true for harvard, but other colleges certainly)"
1915,"yeah, i completely understand what you're saying, but also, while the degree is a harvard degree regardless, the online experience is undoubtedly not going to give you the same intellectual benefits and encounters.  this is definitely debatable, but i would argue the friendships and people you surround yourself there and make friends/form relationships worth are more valuable than anything else at college.  the ripple effect is certainly a legitimate concern, but no matter what, i feel like us seniors need to decide what's best for us and our families and not worry too much about what our choice contributes to in the long term scheme of things.  just wondering, when is the current deposit/ gap year deadline for harvard?"
1916,highly highly doubt it. harvard won’t even count summer courses that you pay for towards credit/your gpa if they’re online (though who knows how that’ll change with the coronavirus.)
1917,"no, these courses don't count. but, if you are planning to take cs50, the course is pretty much the same on edx so it might give you a head start

ps i was a forum moderator for a couple of harvardx courses and harvard '19"
1918,"i'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/covid19_commentary] [do the edx online courses count for credit at harvard?](https://www.reddit.com/r/covid19_commentary/comments/ft72jf/do_the_edx_online_courses_count_for_credit_at/)

1919,nothing on edx from harvard is for credit. edx is not part of the extension school.
1920,and extension school classes don’t count for normal harvard credit. so basically neither will help you out.
1921,"i was in the first year of harvard's ms in computational science & engineering a half decade ago, which likely has a great deal of overlap with the ms in data science, and it was still a tremendous and rewarding challenge for me.

my background was in computing so i had similar early reservations but the access to advanced courses you have will guaranteed give you the set of challenges you'd want. the reading group i was in gave me the most fascinating deep dive into distributed systems in an environment with only a dozen other competent students and an educator leading the field whilst also entirely aware of the shortcomings. the machine learning course and connections had me on the cutting edge of technology that would come to the fore in a few years time. i don't think you'll find any lack of challenges if that's your desire.

the goal for most students is entirely varied and up to the individual. i have seen it serve as a jumping board for all the options you pondered. none of my friends would have had an issue getting a job at any of the standard big firms so i wouldn't worry about that. first and most importantly they were all insanely competent individuals but secondly almost every company is interested in those graduating such programs.

i did not do the thesis option so can't speak to that."
1922,"if you want to email me, i'd be happy to tell you my thoughts privately. rylanschaeffer@g.harvard.edu"
1923,can i ask how you moved from harvard to metamind to wherever you are now?
1924,"i don't think my history is particularly relevant to the op's question except to say that the combination of the skills and credentials afforded by harvard plus my own work would give me a foot in the door at just about any place i'd imagine, academic or industry. i was very lucky in gaining many of those stepping stones but my time at harvard, both community and program, certainly provided many of those early stepping stones free.

for the history however: i went and did a brief stint with common crawl in the summer break during my masters. they're a small non-profit with an active and engaged patron and represented the exact type of non-profit work i wanted to do in the data science community. after a while with them i applied to metamind (only applied to them as they had the specific startup + research opportunity i wanted) as i wanted to transition from dataset creation to machine learning again. metamind gave me an opportunity to move back into machine learning and eventually led to the salesforce acquisition where i was able to focus on research entirely, specifically language modeling in deep learning. i left salesforce research after a few years for my own venture, tba and hilariously more about discovering what i want to do than being an effective mode for any work ^_^

work on forging good connections with the community you care about. this can be writing articles, interacting in discussions (science twitter is surprisingly alive!), collaborating on projects, ... as long as you enjoy it and gain from it. for me the distributed systems / data science / machine learning / deep learning communities are all tied together and i have friends across the various fields and subfields, allowing me to explore various interests with their help.

if you have specific questions i'm happy to try and answer as i can :)"
1925,"i lived in cronkhite. mostly ed school students who are generally social and kind. food was downstairs from dorms so made it nice when it was stormy, but was absolutely nothing special. it was a bit off a walk to the science buildings but manageable. overall i had a great experience there and felt it was the best decision i made while at harvard."
1926,"do all of the gsas dorms use the same dining hall?

i'm leaning towards taking my offer at harvard for an am, but food is a really important consideration."
1927,"agreed about mather, it’s literally a concrete jungle. doesn’t look like a harvard house. it’s the canaday of houses"
1928,discriminating against asians (which harvard admitted to doing) is just as wrong as discriminating against blacks or hispanics. harvard is a racist institution and i can't wait for them to get torn apart by the supreme court.
1929,"it is exactly when people start saying that they are discriminated that discrimination starts. when asians start suing schools for not getting in, schools may start admitting more, just to avoid lawsuits or being called racists and students who are better don’t get in because of fucking politics. get that bs outta here. ok, you have that 1600 but that doesn’t make you fit to attend harvard, yale, princeton, mit or any other top institution which produces the world’s leaders because your sat score or your grade doesn’t show that you can be a leader and help change the world like many harvard alums try and do. i hope, if it goes to scotus, harvard wins big time and the pressure to admit 100 asians with 1600, 10 years of piano and math competition wins stops. there are many 1200 sats with 1000x times better personality than those 1600 sat and 0 personality asians. why your superiority in a flawed multiple choice tests matters more than the other’s superiority in motivation to change the world through participation in meaningful ecs? asian ppl (who complain) chill, there are thousands of kids rejected from harvard, not everyone plays the race card goes ahead to sue the university. if you think harvard is racist, which is an absurd thought, then don’t apply."
1930,i am just saying that there are asians which are 1600 sat and no personality. the same holds for americans and europeans but they don’t go ahead and sue harvard for not getting in.
1931,"i'm pretty sure anyone within your good judgement can write one. believe it or not, rules at harvard are not really that rigid. 

but have you tried asking the office who'd be receiving said letters? do that first."
1932,why wouldn't a person at harvard consider mit??
1933,harvard is like wendy’s
1934,haha nice. cantelmo is a supporter of scholarship first an alma mater second. he’s got a soft spot for harvard even though yale is obviously better.
1935,"i plan on renting a large pack animal such as an ox, donkey, camel, etc from a nearby farm and simply tying my stuff down to the animal to move. much like the harvard students of the 17th century did."
1936,"hbs has a food court and cafe and is near harvard stadium

&#x200b;

if you're willing to cross the river there's a dunkin "
1937,"there are a ton of places in harvard square, including the smith campus center, which has multiple food options but also places you can just hang out. it's about a 10-15 minute walk from the stadium.

in the other direction, and a little closer, there's a nice little branch of the boston public library. address is 300 north harvard st."
1938,"did five week summer program in the dominican republic. best harvard experience by far. there were only five of us in the program. lots of hiking, snorkeling, beach trips. we spent one of the weekends at the professor's family's house in the mountains even. really glad i did that instead of some internship (or study abroad in some tamer place)"
1939,"did the venice study abroad program the summer before sophomore year. harvard students are combined with students from ca'foscari university ( the uni in venice) and yall take classes together taught by both harvard and cf faculty. 

absolutely amazing experience, made lots of italian friends, can navigate venice's transportation system (im proud of that lol), had a great time. i learned a lot about their culture (and vice versa i suppose) since we literally took classes and did homework together. the italian students would invite us to bars after classes.

you take 2 courses, they're not that demanding. but if you take the math class that's offered, be ready to be psetting on the canals for much of your time there. (8 weeks!)

also i drank. a lot. europe is great."
1940,how many students from harvard attended the program? i'm also interested in the venice program
1941,"the quantitative vs theoretical split in economics goes back a number of years, particularly in reference to competition between harvard and mits departments. additionally, quantiative economics (itself an infrequently used term, which i mentioned simply to clear up any confusion about the reference to quant -- or quantitative methods -- in the earlier comments) is not equivalent to econometrics, as you suggest. econometrics is a set of tools within quantitative economics

i have heard mixed reviews of 1123, probably going to stick with 1126"
