1,"my guess is that brown's reaction will not be a harsh as harvard's but will soon roll out recommendations against traveling back from our spring break destinations with classes following spring break being only online. 

although, compared to other ivies brown is slow to act which is surprising given we literally have a couple of cases in providence already. i'm expecting an announcement mid-week to switch to online classes and then a subsequent one next week to announce online class for the rest of the semester."
2,"i generally agree with her although i believe that revenue loss shouldn’t be a motive for bringing students back. the government should provide relief packages for institutions of higher education (yes even harvard) so that they have more financial leeway to bring people back on campus and not cause controversy by dipping their hands into ppp.

i’m not so sure about her hotels idea but i don’t see why she just recommends extending off campus housing permission to more students."
3,">when students wanted university pass, she considered and then rejected  it. also clear now it was the right decision, given that brown would  have been the only university to do that and become a laughingstock.

[here](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/03/penn-ivy-league-pass-fail-mandatory-universal-coronavirus) is the grading policy of the ivy league for the spring semester.  four schools have adopted a form of mandatory pass/fail grading, while the other four have implemented an opt-in system like brown's.

[coronavirus crisis: what america can learn from other nations in the war on covid-19](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/todaysdebate/2020/04/26/coronavirus-lessons-taiwan-south-korea-iceland-germany-editorials-debates/3010341001/)

now, does it look like trump is learning anything from other countries? if not, since brown is not on an island with its own border, we can't blame paxton if we can't go back to campus in september. in the meantime, maybe we can all learn how to do pcr tests like those students in the brown’s [pre-college program](https://precollege.brown.edu/catalog/course.php?course_code=cebi0937) to help with [aggressive testing](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/opinion/coronavirus-test.html).  over the past week, about 151,000 americans per day were tested for the coronavirus.  how much more is needed? to sustain a resumption of activity, estimates range from [500,000 tests per day](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html) to[ five million per day](https://ethics.harvard.edu/files/center-for-ethics/files/roadmaptopandemicresilience_final_0.pdf), and beyond."
4,"the data comes from [here, at the us dept of education.](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?217156-brown-university) the definition is:

>the median annual earnings of former students  one year after graduation. **only data from students who received federal  financial aid is included in the calculation.**  
>  
>these data are  based on school-reported information about students' program of  completion. the u.s. department of education department cannot fully  confirm the completeness of these reported data for this school.

i think in other discussions, people have pointed out that the discrepancy with other top schools might have more to do with how many people are getting federal financial aid.  so it might have more to do with the sample or the sample size than actual, across-the-board earnings.

here's a quote from [a discussion on this topic](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/2164299-colleges-with-highest-new-grad-median-earnings-by-major.html) at college confidential:

>what is missing is the number graduating. according to brown, in 2018  they awarded 248 bss in cs. since it started from 48 in 2010, we can  figure that there are no more than 800 cs graduates of brown who are  more than a year after graduation. about 17% of brown students are on  pell grants. however, in 2012 it was 14%, and in 2008, it was 12%. so  perhaps 15% of all brown cs graduates received federal support. so that  median represents maybe 120 students, and, considering the rate of  response to these questionnaires, we're talking maybe 50 graduates, more  likely closer to 30. so that median is meaningless.

the discussion quoted above also states that numbers from other universities like upenn and harvard are similarly too low to be representative.

here's [another site](https://www.ivyachievement.com/computer-science-rankings/) with a lot of information about salaries. it  has brown's median starting salary for cs as $84,600.

i'm no expert, but these are things i've seen in other reddit posts or web searches that seem to confirm my suspicion that most brown cs graduates won't be starting with $141k salaries."
5,"if you ask a brown student, it’s harvard. if you ask a harvard student, it’s not."
6,it's supposed to be dartmouth (or was) but nobody cared. harvard was the rival people got most into.
7,"seeing that brown has the reputation of ""the artsy ivy,"" i don't think brown students care about rivalries all that much.  also, i'm a harvard grad and i've never once heard anyone say that brown is our rival (that's the safety school in new haven, of course).

if anything, it's risd (rhode island school of design), the world-renowned art school right next door.  the only thing artsier than a brown student is an art school student.  ; )"
8,"realistically, any ""rivalry"" is concentrated within the ivy league; harvard definitely draws the most fan ire, especially in basketball and football. all the ivy games are the most important, but particularly harvard (or probably cornell for hockey -- their hockey fans were actually the most hostile fans of all i interacted with in my experience)

source: former bruno the bear! lots of exposure to different athletic crowds."
9,"brown and uri (university of rhode island) are [football rivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brown–rhode_island_football_rivalry) and play for a trophy called the governor's cup every year, but outside of the tiny percentage of the brown community that follows the football team no one would consider uri a rival. i agree with other posters that most brown students don't view brown as having a rival, but if they had to pick one it would be harvard due to its proximity and its reputation"
10,"definitely true from a brown perspective, but it should be noted that harvard doesn't really recognize this rivalry (which is, ironically, the best way to ""win"" a rivalry). they say they're rivals with yale. i don't know what yale thinks about that."
11,"yeah, for sure a one way rivalry. brown wants to prove they can beat harvard; harvard has nothing to prove.

i think harvard-yale is well recognized by both schools as a rivalry; the harvard-yale game seems like a pretty big deal all around."
12,"oh my god! you were the bad poems guy. flashbacks to that crazy week haha, i can still remember all of the stress and anxiety. which adoch did you do? 14-15 here. i think we have a pretty similar story. i didn't get into hps and was salty for quite a while (almost took a gap year because of the harvard waitlist). i eventually decided to go to college (probably for the best), but my choice was, well, maybe not the best. i felt that if i didn't go to columbia i would have the most regret since it's just so well known, but i'm starting to feel the opposite way. so what if columbia has 4 more living billionaires? who am i kidding? these aren't factors that are going to seriously affect my undergraduate experience. i would love to chat -- i am curious about your decision making process and life at brown. at the end of the day, i could've made a million charts, diagrams, and comparisons, but i knew deep down that i was probably going to go to columbia -- i guess some mistakes you just have to make yourself."
13,"consider 2 premed students, one has a stable home life and one doesn't. if the university makes it mandatory s/nc for this semester then both students can argue it was forced by the university and the med schools will likely accept the credit because many people will be in this situation (you really think a med school will deny applicants from yale and harvard which have implemented mandatory s/nc?). however if brown doesn't do this then the person without a stable home life will be more likely to have to change their course to s/nc meaning they won't get into a med school"
14,"i'm not sure how i feel about this. not saying i agree or disagree, but just not sure. 

by this same logic, doesn't it follow that the schools could decide to pay their faculty (or other employees) less, because the online teaching experience doesn't provide as much value as in-person? obviously that would be cruel.

obv a super rich school with a huge endowment like harvard is going to be fine regardless, but in general, i hope that universities will continue to pay their employees, and in order to do that, many of them probably need to maintain their income from tuition. plus, endowments are often restricted. or is that not the case? i'd be curious to see the operating costs & budgets for some different private universities. 

maybe a more nuanced approach is that universities should offer to re-evaluate all financial aid claims and eligibilities (like immediately, rather than at the beginning of the next academic year), given that many families have experienced major financial upsets that might make them eligible for more need-based aid.

i'm curious to hear everyone's hot take on this."
15,that's probably because that's what they're called at harvard. and so facebook special cased it for the few correct schools
16,"hm i would say as a sophomore that so far, my view on brown's school spirit is like just students genuinely enjoying the campus culture and what the school has in store for us. it won't be like highschool musical pt 2 in college, it probably is more internal spirit rather than everyone chanting go brown!! everyday haha. also, football game against harvard was kinda a big event xd"
17,i've heard from past students that the harvard game is the one time that everyone shows up for football haha! thanks for the response!
18,"are you an idiot?  not at all.  i’m in my 30s and to this day still have what if regrets about harvard so i completely understand really wanting to push for a transfer to brown if that’s where you truly want to go.

but that all said, i do think i agree with your parents on this.  the fundamental purpose of going to college is to get an education.  it sounds from your post like this is already happening at your current school and that you are in fact bonding with your instructors who are all willing to spend extra time to invest in you.  you’ll certainly find that at brown too if you reach out.  but is it really worth going back to square one at this point?

also, and this is extremely important for you to understand, there are a lot of stupid students at brown.  i only have the assessment you provided in your initial posting but if that’s all 100% true, you’ll likely still be on the higher end of your classes at brown also.  you’ll certainly not be put on a pedestal by students at brown because many of them have pretty big egos (having themselves been among the best students in their respective classes most of their lives) so that will at least be taken care of i guess, but on the flip side of everyone has that kind of attitude it becomes much harder to get legitimate recognition for achievements.  so keep that in mind.

now this is not to say brown is horrible.  far from it, there are a lot of great people that go to school there and a lot of great professors (some of whom i still keep in touch with).  but you need to understand that brown isn’t this magical world where everyone eats sunshine and shits rainbows.  it’s a school with its own culture, and it’s own strengths and weaknesses.  you need to take a good hard look at what those strengths and weaknesses are relative to the strengths and weaknesses of your current school, and really see if making the transition is worth all the costs."
19,"sorry to bud in but i just had a quick question. i also am hesitant of applying ed to brown because fear having what-if regrets about schools like harvard. brown matches what i’m looking for in a college but i feel like no matter what the case, there will always be buyers regret.

my question was, what do you regret about attending brown?"
20,"responding to just a few of these that i had experience with to add to the first comment:

3) likewise to what the previous comment said, you only really visit other ivies if you have friends there and choose to visit them. i was involved in a couple of club sports and we traveled to other campuses to compete with their teams, so if you want an excuse to visit other ivies, a good bet would be to get involved in club sports, or if you aren't a sports type, find a club that travels to other campuses to either compete or collaborate etc.

4) the sweatshirt i bought from the bookstore during adoch (brown's version of admitted students day) has been my favorite go-to sweatshirt for the last 5 years. 

6) i worked lots on a startup that brown students created. in our specific experience, brown didn't fund us and didn't really do a whole lot to help us get further established, which was a pretty big disappointment to us. other brown startups might have had a different experience, but for us they didn't support us. brown helped put together a couple forums of students from brown startups to meet with each other and discuss what they were doing, but outside of that the school didn't seem to be particularly encouraging or supportive of on-campus startups. 

8) definitely depends on what you're planning on concentrate in. if you don't have an idea of what you want to study, start broadly in your first semester and try to find what interests you. most concentrations are able to be completed in less than 4 years so it's ok to not get started on requirements immediately, but some have many more requirements so its important to get started on those early if you know that's what you want to study. 

14) as mentioned, brown dining service is the largest source of on-campus jobs for students. i got paid from the start-up i worked for so i cannot attest to the buds experience, but my friends who worked with them basically did because they had to, they never really seemed to enjoy it much. i'd also recommend finding a paid job in the department you choose to study in; i worked a couple years in a biomed lab which was very cool and worthwhile, i learned a lot of relevant skills and got paid a good amount more than what buds pays.

21) i'm not sure of funny websites, but in regards to seeing what menus the dining halls have, there is a website that has this: ([https://dining.brown.edu/](https://dining.brown.edu/)) and browsing through it just now i see there's a way to subscribe to get daily menus sent to your email, which is pretty cool and i highly recommend. after eating dining hall food for a while, you'll learn of dishes that you like more than others, so it's nice to see in advance which dining halls will have your favorites and when. 

23) if this is something you want to do, get involved early. publications like to get first years involved, and that way come junior and senior year, you are right at the head of the line for editor/leadership positions. this can extend to just about any club, but i feel like this pertains particularly to campus publications.

28) you can rent brown parking spaces (they are pretty pricey), so most people don't have cars. during junior/senior year when you're able to live off campus, if your house has parking spaces then it's significantly easier (and way cheaper) to have a car on campus, so i'd recommend holding off until you decide to live off-campus (if you decide to do so)

30) rubbing the foot is harvard lol. naked donut run is fun, spring weekend is also fun. during my first year, my friends liked to go to sports games in big groups which was also fun, but that didn't last longer than first semester. nothing else really comes to mind but that's not to say brown never has fun things to do on campus, because there are always things to do with your friend group. "
21,"what are you looking for? berklyley and ucla are both great academically and have good reputations, so i don't think if you're looking at it purely financially it would be worth it.   (that said. compare law school acceptance rates and placement for all 3, brown's is very high and most go to harvard law so that could be a significant factor.  brown's public health is also excellent.)

if you're looking at academic atmosphere, there's a great sense of collaboration here, people are friendly, and i think it's much easier to connect with professors, do undergrad research, and network at brown, but then again if you're looking to stay on the west coast long term that could tip the scales a bit as far as networking priorities.

and socially and for the general culture i also love brown and it's more or less as advertised, so if you think it would be a good fit for you it probably is. 

how those factors align towards being ""worth it"" or not is really up to your priorities, though."
22,"do you know what total failure looks like op? it looks like classes still going on and the entire community getting sick. then all the facilities members get sick as we shut down because nobody shows up to their dining hall and janitorial shifts. meanwhile the infection rate remains high and icus are overloaded with sick patients who need ventilators.

i'm sorry brown's response wasn't ideal, but students on financial aid got $150 for the trouble (i know harvard kids got $500, just look at their endowment, maybe u shld have went to harvard... oh wait) , classes were cancelled before a massive outbreak, students were able to return home before a providence quarantine. and the kids whose homes are in hot zones get to stay on campus and the kids with severe financial burden get to stay on campus.

the cost of a pandemic is not brown's fault, it's just fun for y'all to bandwagon and hate on cpax and brown because you're ungrateful. if you genuinely wanted to talk about the failings of brown during this time, you would have pointed out specific and logical evidence of their failings, and not write a baity post trying to get upvotes for talking shit."
23,"unfortunately, harvard's newspaper, the crimson, [misinterpreted](http://www.thecrimson.com/blog/the-back-page/article/2011/9/25/football-blog-brown-092511/) the formation.

disregarding that misinterpretation, the article is painful to read, with them trying delicately to describe the ""male sex organ"" and then pulling a 180 and uncomfortably joking about how the name of our school is brown.  in my opinion the article would be improved with some [brevity](http://i.imgur.com/2zhqi.jpg).

"
24,the first two jokes were decent. but then they couldn't hold back that classic harvard douchiness any longer.
25,"i understand that these free classes are not as rigorous as regular harvard courses, so i wouldn't expect to be able to transfer credit for these. 

however, given the new situation with coronavirus, do you think brown might adjust their policy about online classes a bit and give credit for classes at other schools that are actually the ""real thing,"" just offered online?"
26,"my brother went to harvard and did not have at all as personalized experience - there was less focus on undergrads, and he found the school in some ways to be resting on its laurels. i understand that it is hard to get past the possibility of telling people you go/went to harvard. congrats either way - you sure are lucky to have those options."
27,"i was in a similar position, and after realizing that my heart wanted me to go to brown (and the only reason i wanted to go to harvard was for the name), i chose brown. four years later i'm really happy with my decision. i think both schools would have offered me largely the same opportunities. 

at the end of the day, either road is a good one. you really can't go wrong so congrats!"
28,"yeah harvard has the name, but at the same time the prestige has a lot to do with the caliber of student. you got into harvard. should you go to brown, you'll still be the same person and you'll probably end up in roughly the same place. i can't really speak to med school personally, but plenty of people from brown end up at the same banks and consulting firms as harvard students, just like many high-performing students from lower ranked schools do as well. 

a huge thing brown has going for it is the open curriculum. i discovered that i wanted to study biology in my junior year, and because of the open curriculum, i was able to add bio as a second major really late in the game. i guarantee i would not have been able to do that snd still graduate in four years had i gone to a school that has general education requirements, and i probably wouldn't have dipped my toe into bio in the first place had it not been for the ability to take any course s/nc.   

if grad school is on your radar, brown students place very frequently into top grad schools. i don't know about med school data, but i know that [brown students who go to law school more frequently end up at harvard than anywhere else](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/law-school/statistics).   

you really can't go wrong here, so just go where you think you would be happier."
29,"congratulations! they're both top schools, and there is no wrong choice. we get caught up in these big picture kinds of things, but the larger impact on your quality of life will be your roommate and the people you find and the clubs you join.

harvard might have an elitist culture favoring the wealthy, but you'll still find friends. and brown is hella presigious."
30,"i think that the right call is to go with your gut on which place you think you'll be happier at. both institutions are super respected, and while harvard certainly is a bigger name, i don't think this matters a ton besides random people being more impressed that you went to harvard. what you get out of your experience is much more important. i chose brown because i thought i would be happiest here, and i am so glad i didn't base my decision on prestige because i don't think i would have been nearly as happy at some of these other places i could have ended up at."
31,"i was in the same position last year. chose brown and would not look back. the undergraduate-focused teaching is really top-notch and noticeable even from the ""intro"" courses. 

one of my closest friends left for harvard and was not so thrilled at the culture at h."
32,"granted all these answers will come from people who chose brown, but having heard from friends of mine who went to harvard i'm very glad i went to brown. i'd agree with some of the people who suggested that harvard rests on its laurels a little bit. there's something to be said for a school and a student body that isn't harvard and therefore has to work harder to achieve prestige rather than getting it without trying (all extremely relative of course, as they are both prestigious and rolling in money). brown has a very different culture from harvard. i think almost everyone i know would agree that it is very collaborative and not at all competitive, which is not the case at harvard. also, from a personal standpoint, i'd rather go to school with people who chose brown for what it is (open curriculum, laidback culture, a little outside the mainstream) than people who just went to harvard because its harvard. but of course these are all oversimplifications, so as other people have said it's probably best to make your decision based on all factors other than the name!"
33,"one thing to consider is, brown is very undergrad focused. at brown, undergrads are little over 2x the size of grad population. at mit, grad population is little over 1.5x undergrad population. what this means is that professors at brown often have very small research groups (like 1~5 phd students per professor) so finding research groups is very easy and you get a lot of individual attention from professors. some of the professors i met at brown have become my strongest advocates and i will eternally be grateful to them. i'm now heading to stanford for phd where grad students are little over 1.4x undergrad population. i'm personally very satisfied with this trajectory because i get to go to undergrad focused school for undergrad and grad focused school for grad.

as for friends, i made some of my closest friends while tackling psets together! in brown's math program, you will also discover the joys of pset parties!! this was the case for me in my math and physics classes. also, brown's math department in particular, i would say, is pretty tight knit (check out friday math tea sessions if you end up choosing brown!). i made some really great friends through the math dept even though i'm physics.

regarding academics, i think that brown has quite strong pure math programs, although if you are looking to go more bio side, brown has a fantastic applied math program! you can also venture into biostatistics which is a separate program administered under the masters in public health (but undergrads can take the courses. i myself took a statistical data analysis class in biostat program).

on a final note, i'm sure mit students have great post-grad outcomes, but brown students also end up in fantastic places! i didn't know many premed very well personally, but the three that i know ended up in johns hopkins, columbia, and uchicago med schools. i know far more people who went to other grad schools, and the vast majority ended up in top 10 institutions (i can remember 1 harvard law, most common destinations from physics seemed like stanford/harvard/mit, chemistry ended up in caltech/harvard, princeton seemed to be a popular destination for cs phds, idk the rest), so i don't think you need to worry about how strong your research profile will become at brown as opposed to mit!"
34,"shoot. i'm going back to look this up and i think i had a little brain mix-up between harvard and mit. sorry bout that. you can definitely do it with harvard though: https://courses.harvard.edu/crossregistration.html

however, i did hear of someone from brown who was taking math classes at mit. i can't find any official program for this but i'm guessing they made this happen by talking to people"
35,"1. in my years at brown, i've never encountered any sort of large scale event. that might be a combination of various factors ranging from ""i don't care"" to ""different social groups"". i mean they must be kinda doing something since we have a sort of lgbt greek society, but even on that my knowledge is murky at best since i only have a single friend in greek life, and he's in sigma chi, which if i had to wager, is not lgbt-themed 
2. you'll run into some people who legit are classist as fuck. i have a friend who decided to stop talking to someone because the kid's parents weren't of 'good stock'. true story. of course the whole canada goose meme circulates like the flu on the meme page, but generally, most people don't seem to give a shit and outwardly, will treat you with little apparent bias. that has just been my experience as an upper middle class asian dude. your mileage may vary. but again, i reiterate that like 99% of people don't seem to *overtly* show any signs of classism or elitism. 
3. yeah i can't answer that. it's called like an 'independent concentration' or something like that and you'd very obviously need to work closely with the school to make sure you actually have a degree and not a piece of fancy toilet paper after your 4 years. from what i have surmised by talking to friends who have since graduated, this 'ic' is pretty rare. check it out [here](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/curricular-resource-center/independent-concentrations/current-independent-concentrators/current-independent-concentrators)
4. ~~i chose brown because i got rejected by harvard~~ i'm kidding i didn't apply to harvard. i chose brown because i hate the idea of general ed and english classes. i also came with the misguided notion that all the faculty here are amazing teachers and that i was ready for that small class experience, but man we've got some *shitty* professors here."
36,"harvard-yale, princeton-penn, cornell-dartmouth, leaving us with columbia? makes sense i guess given our polar opposite academic philosophies. "
37,"in theory dartmouth, but nobody cared when i was there. the real ""rival"" was harvard bc we wanted to be better than them."
38,brown-harvard football is usually the best tailgate and has the best attendance of the season
39,"i don't know about the first, but as far as the motivation of the school, i think its just to avoid the stigma of associated with having sexual assault on campus. also maybe the policy just a relic of a time when people didnt take this as seriously. whatever the motivation, brown is definitely not the only school on this boat

"
40,"there are people who are too full of themselves everywhere.  i would estimate that people (outwardly) like him are a minority at brown, harvard, and elsewhere.  i could definitely see this in the brown noser, though."
41,"i know you're not trying to suggest that you're seriously considering doing this, but i'm just trying to provide something on s/nc.  like others, i've heard vague stories, but that's about it. i'm definitely interested in hearing concrete stories. so, i upvoted. if whoever is reading this comment is not looking for advice, then ignore the paragraph below.

rumor has it that someone took all their courses s/nc and somehow got into harvard med... must've been killer rec's. even if so, this may be the anomaly. if you're in the math or sciences, you would need to do a lot of explaining, perhaps even provide proof that you didn't get all c's. this can be supported if there are course performance reports along with good recommendations and/or relevant extracurricular activities. they'll have to show proof of s with distinction, which doesn't even show in internal transcripts, but only in a temporary place in banner.  for industry, research, and grad school, it'll most likely be an uphill battle. i'm pretty sure i wouldn't have gotten into grad school if i took all s/nc in engineering, even if i explained the purpose of s/nc.  do i have proof? no, but for the above areas i mentioned -- which i can only speak for since i concentrated in a similar area -- one would have to think who else they are up against that didn't have the s/nc option in other schools such as mit (pass/d/f with a limit and major-related restrictions) and georgia tech (pass/fail with a limit and possible major-related restrictions).  if you're in engineering, keep in mind that brown isn't quite known for it, even though it's good (i've met many that responded with ""brown has engineering?""). brown is a great university with a great name, but that can only go so far, and your application would require additional support.  i'm going to guess that in other areas, if you take a lot of s/nc courses, you would likely need additional support as well. i'd say (and many would probably agree) that if it's not for a requirement, feel free to take s/nc. it would be easy to explain in that respect. whoever is in the math or sciences and takes all s/nc has some serious guts."
42,"i studied physics at brown, worked in defense scientific software for a year, now starting phd in physics this year.

if you study up to the level of phd in physics, your job prospects are fantastic! your thesis could have been in string theory and finance companies are still going to want you to do their stock market prediction models. professorship is harder to get than ever, but many industry research arms are often looking for a physics phd. if you are strategic, your thesis could be quite related to your job (basically if you do solid state research, semiconductor giants and quantum computing companies will welcome you with open arms). if you do computational research, transitioning into software is crazy easy (tbh this is true even if you don't do computational research). there are also national labs that are hungry for new phds--their trouble is attracting talent to live in the middle of nowhere, which can also be said for many defense giants.

even if you stop after your bachelors, if you know how to program, you will still have an easy time finding a job. i took only 3 coding classes at brown (none in cs), and did some computational physics research, and had tons of job offers for software/data science positions from big corporations. i don't know much about gtech, but brown physics students have top grad school placements and brown cs students have top industry placements. anecdotally (from people whose outcomes i know personally), the most popular phd destinations for physics students are harvard, mit, stanford, and most popular cs placements are google, microsoft, and fb.

i think ee/ce at brown is also pretty great, though i can't speak a ton on it because i don't know as many people in ee or ce. i know one ee who got grad offers from uchicago and columbia and chose to go to columbia. the one ce i know ended up at microsoft (they were kind of pivoting towards comp sci near graduation though). i heard that quite a few ees end up at boeing every year.

at the end of the day, individual field rankings at these schools don't matter for undergrad (they matter more on grad school level). just go for what your gut feeling is telling you, and you'll do great no matter what your choice may be!"
43,"i do believe that it is mostly the major/career choice that explains this difference. but regardless, the question for you is: what college will you attend if it's not brown and how much will it cost you? if your alternative is going to harvard, well, provided you do well there, you'll probably make more money in the future. if you alternative is going to wichita st or de vry (hehe), maybe not so much. if you don't have an offer to attend another ivy league, then the comparison in the article is pretty irrelevant for you.

for example, according to [this article](http://www.businessinsider.com/top-25-best-colleges-salaries-2016-9), when you consider all universities, brown is 20th overall in income 10 years after graduation. that sounds pretty good to me. do you have an offer of admission to any other universities in that list? again, the relevant question is what's the best university you are able to attend, the rest doesn't matter."
44,"and can you clarify why you think harvard would provide more money, given that brown is also an ivy? 

i think what i'm trying to ask is that in your personal experience, what do you honestly think brown hasn't given you career-outcomewise that your peers at other colleges might have?

and once again, all these colleges are great, but i do have the decision to choose between two great institutions, which is why i'm making these fine distinctions."
45,"i was a grad student at brown so i don't think i can give an accurate answer to your second question. the best i can say is that i have met people in cs, apma, and econ, and i think it's a great combination to study at brown.

back to your first question, sure, both harvard and brown are ivies but that does not mean they are identical. and as much as brown is a very prestigious university, harvard is a step above.

but, this really doesn't matter to you, you have to think about brown and duke. about that, i would encourage you to take a look at [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html) (interestingly, coauthored by a brown professor): it shows how different colleges compare in terms of what socioeconomic background their students come from and how they do later in life. you can make the tables show you duke and brown and you'll see that they look fairly similar in that regard but brown seems to be a bit more successful in making its students who come from the bottom 40% of the income distribution make it to the top 40%.

so all in all, i would just try to figure out which one of the two feels like the best fit for you personally. if you are happy at the university you choose, you'll do better, and that's gonna have a big impact in how you fare afterwards.



"
46,"brown does not have secret societies in the sense of yale or harvard.

as far as traditional secret societies go, secrecy is valuable as a form of social currency. our greek-letter organizations (which gave up ownership of their clubhouses decades ago) are still secret in this way, with each of them having rituals that help the members bond and create a sense of organizational pride. however, secrecy is cumbersome, and it's extraordinarily difficult to keep a secret social society going if it does not have some form of permanent meeting space. brown's greek letter organizations are granted semi-permanent space in the dorms on wriston quad.

you should be skeptical of any supposedly old societies that do _not_ have clubhouses. it's far easier to convincingly fake a secret society than it is to run an actual organization, and /u/iamthewaffler severely underestimates how much fun it is to do so."
47,"brown is an undergraduate based school 100%, i’m an engineer and they had to build a multi multi million dollar engineering building just to finally attract mediocre graduate talent as compared to other schools like yale, harvard, princeton, mit. brown is not known for its grad for a reason, we attract some of the fiercest competition for undergrad for a reason. trust me brown is begging students to stay for grad but they just aren’t so of that doesn’t tell you idk what will."
48,"you can find the number of applicants from brown at [https://www.aamc.org/data/facts/applicantmatriculant/](https://www.aamc.org/data/facts/applicantmatriculant/).  at least for the last 3 years i have been monitoring the number, the number of applicants from brown remains pretty stable. this application cycle there are 235 applicants from brown. pre-health advising knows the qualifications needed to be admitted to med schools. only qualified applicants get a committee letter. the article you linked basically tells you for those who are not qualified, they won't get it. there is no structural flaw.  all the schools at this level have committee letter system. if brown has ""structural flaws"" in pre-health advising, all the schools at this level have the same structural flaws. this system benefits the applicants who have the committee letter, which shows institutional support. two third of applicants from ivies have at least one gap year. gap year is not needed if you are a very strong applicant. last year one person i know got into harvard medical school with no gap year. again, they will advise you if you are a strong applicant or not. in my opinion, plme program is good for us because plmes are not applying out. brown's life sciences programs are extremely strong. more than one fifth of students are in life and medical sciences. ([https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-research/factbook/degrees-and-completions](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/institutional-research/factbook/degrees-and-completions))"
49,"i think that those two options are basically the same thing.

i heard that he ended up applying to both law and medical school at harvard, before ultimately doing neither and becoming a rhodes scholar instead. "
50,"first, i should note that your experience will vary widely based on your interests, your personality, your living situation, your freshman unit, and your extracurriculars.

 anyway, the culture is definitely more relaxed overall. the administration is generally extremely permissive, trusting students to make the best decisions for themselves. the students are intrinsically motivated, which creates an atmosphere of cooperative competition. (compare to harvard or similar, where competition is cutthroat.) as for free time, you could spend your entire life in the scili or you could hit up the frats/bars seven days a week. it's all about who you fall in with.

one of the biggest distinguishing factors is how little people care about the varsity sports teams. athletes have a somewhat separate culture, although due to our size the percent of student athletes is high. having worked in a big state school college town, i can say that the difference in enthusiasm levels for sports there vs sports at brown is truly astounding."
51,"the one other thing i'll say is this: brown isn't a ""party school"" as it's typically defined. people have their academic and extra-academic pursuits, and they're quite serious about them, but (unlike harvard and yale) they know where to draw the line between work and play, and they can play quite hard in their play time."
52,columbia’s aid is similar to brown’s in my experience. the only thing with columbia is that it’s in nyc which may end up making it more expensive. harvard/yale give better aid
53,"columbia is also need aware and has a smaller endowment than the larger ivys like yale and harvard. in terms of endowment for all the ivys, as of 2019, harvard had $39.2 billion, yale had $29.4 billion, princeton university had $25.9 billion, university of pennsylvania had $13.8 billion, columbia university had $10.9 billion, cornell university had $7.2 billion, dartmouth college had $5.5 billion, and brown university had $3.8 billion, [according to the columbia spectator](https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2019/05/02/cc-seas-tuition-to-be-most-expensive-in-the-nation-at-over-62000/) . good luck!"
54,"brown is better than harvard for humanities imo, but i'm a phd student, not undergrad"
55,"i heard from someone who transferred here that it's also a better place to be a humanities phd. harvard has certain expectations of everyone it accepts, and as you might imagine, there's some really weird attitudes among harvard's humanities phds"
56,"i find that brown's phds are generally quite a bit more politically naive than they harvard colleagues. this has made my time here much more enjoyable and straightforward than my time there, but i remain worried that they'll have a very rude awakening elsewhere."
57,"i don’t have access to the data so i don’t know for certain. what i do know is that your scores are very competitive already. but american colleges are now looking more at your ecs and essays than your scores since schools like harvard, brown, or mit could fill their entire classes 3 times over with perfect sat scorers and 4.0+ gpas. in essence, you’re more than a set of numbers, and admissions are paying attention to the human aspect more than ever."
