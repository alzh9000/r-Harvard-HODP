2,"a couple of hours after bulldog days began on monday, two prefrosh were jaywalking across the street in front of durfee’s. in new haven fashion, the driver didn’t stop and both prefrosh were injured and hospitalized. the car drove away before it could be identified, so it’s a hit-and-run. 

both of them are okay now, one of them had a leg injury (broken leg, i believe) and one of them had an arm injury. 

one of them was admitted to harvard as well. yale probably isn’t looking great for him right now. 

source: my prefrosh roommate for bulldog days was friends with them.

edit: the driver was found hiding in the freezer of a local pizzeria."
3,"i stumbled upon this article, and it really has challenged the way i view yale/ similar ivy institutions. (article linked below). 

my thoughts:

i know this experience isn’t unique to yale (and most 
certainly is true at other institutions). furthermore, i know that yale offers world-class opportunities and resources quite unparalleled anywhere else. however, that being said, this article really has reaffirmed that yale/harvard/ivies are really just a brand and a business, concerned about their public image (arguably) more so than the educational and intellectual growth of the student. 


any of your thoughts welcome! i’m curious as to what everyone else thinks.

5,"hey guys, hope everyones doing well with the world ending and jazz. today i got an email from the eli whitney program team about setting up an interview in a few weeks (zoom, of course). i was just seeing if you guys have any advice as well as answers to a few questions. 

&#x200b;

first off, how much stock should i even be putting into the fact i got an interview in the first place? i want to be excited because, from what i've seen, they handpick people for it but i can't find a good source to confirm that. 

&#x200b;

secondly, what would the 'tone' of the interview be? i did one with harvard a few days ago and it was a really friendly interview with a pretty wide range of questions (personal life, background, academic/non-academic interests, future plans, why 'x' school, etc.). is it safe to say it will be pretty similar? 

&#x200b;

third, in my spare time, i read a lot of works that have to do with the topic i'm hoping to major in (global affairs) and i try to stick to respected scholars and publications. i'm honestly just a massive nerd for the subject and i enjoy reading about it constantly. assuming that it's something relevant to the questions being asked, would it seem too 'try-hard' to bring this up? i really am the type of person who uses their free time to read books by academics, but i don't want to talk about it if it makes me come across as inauthentic or that i believe that i know it all.

&#x200b;

fourth, what are just some general pitfalls people often fall into or things they tend to omit that they should have emphasized more? or really, just any advice in general, unironically i don't know shit so i'll take any wisdom that comes my way.

&#x200b;

ty in advance for the help, hopefully i'll get to see you guys next fall."
6,"so you know how harvard is planning on drowning us out with those damned thundersticks again?! (you should, here's the blog post:http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2011/nov/16/harvard-students-pack-noisemakers-game/?cross-campus) well, they made the mistake of making the order form public.

7,"hi friends,

&#x200b;

i came across on article from the ydn in november said that 43.5 % of seniors live off-campus. as a pre-frosh, this surprised me because i thought the tight-knit res college experience was yale's whole schtick and at colleges with similar housing systems (e.g harvard) a minuscule number of students live outside the house system.

why do so many upperclassmen opt out of the res colleges? 

&#x200b;

boola boola"
8,"hi! i was recently admitted to yale (a dream come true), and i was hoping to get some advice about choosing which school to attend next fall between stanford, harvard, and yale. if anyone here chose yale over harvard/stanford, i would really love to hear what made you choose yale.

i think i want to study ep&e. since these schools are relatively similar in academics, i was also hoping to hear about the social scene/community. do you find yale to be more collaborative or competitive than h/s?

last, i'm from new york, so i wouldn't really get to visit home from palo alto except on long breaks. i don't think this is that much of a big deal for me personally, but my mom would rather i be closer to home, so yale definitely wins in that regard.

if you have any opinion on any of this, i'd really really want to hear."
9,"i'm an undergraduate computer science student who'll be applying for master's programs this coming application cycle. yale is currently on the list of programs i'm looking at, and i wanted to get any input here about the program before applying!

i know many in cs poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons i'm happy to get into if asked, i'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

my interests in cs lie primarily in machine learning (more because i have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security. if any of you are cs graduate students involved in these fields, i'd love to know your experience with the program. if not, i'd still love to hear your thoughts. 

yale being yale, i'm a little concerned about how master's students are treated as opposed phd students when it comes to academic mentorship and opportunities. i've hear horror stories (not necessarily from yale, but from similar big-name cs schools) of phd advisors. i'm also coming from a ""no-name"" state school, and i'm a little intimated by the ivys. are my fears overblown?

for context, here are the other schools i'm looking at (and a fair warning, this list is way too long and part of the reason i'm looking for feedback is to help trim down this list): kth, eth zurich, epfl, stanford, university of michigan, cmu, princeton, cornell, penn, university of wisconsin, university of british columbia, oxford university, cambridge university, harvard university, mcgill university, kings college london."
10,"i'm going to the yale-harvard basketball game on friday. i'm new to the area and am wondering if there will be alcohol served at the game?

thank you strangers!"
11," for the [**sixth semester in a row**](https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/yale-says-sexual-misconduct-complaints-increase-14456597.php), sexual misconduct reports have gone up at yale university, [**double the number**](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/) from spring 2017.

and the yale official responsible for compiling the report seems to regard these rising numbers as a positive development.

“we are hopeful that the increase in complaints reported to the university is an indication that our community is more aware of and more frequently accessing our resources,” stephanie spangler, title ix coordinator and deputy provost for health affairs and academic integrity, told the [***yale daily news***](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/)*.*

some of those analyzing the [**recent semi-annual report**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/sexual%20misconduct%20report%20jan-jun%202019.pdf) are skeptical of the high numbers, however, largely due to the broad definitions for terms such as sexual harassment and sexual assault.

with 169 claims filed from january through june alone, the ivy league school would have a “much higher violent crime rate than any of the nation’s most dangerous cities” if the report is to be believed, brooklyn college prof. kc johnson, who chronicles title ix enforcement at colleges nationwide, wrote in a recent analysis.

the broad definitions have real consequences for students’ rights, according to samantha harris, vice president for procedural advocacy at the foundation for individual rights in education.

“by giving the impression that the university is a hotbed of violent sexual crimes,” she told*the college fix* in an email, “a broad definition like this fosters the type of climate of fear that has led to the wholesale abandonment of due process in campus sexual misconduct adjudications. it also trivializes real sex crimes.”

yale did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls from *the fix* oct. 8-14, asking for its response to johnson’s analysis of the report, published in [***minding the campus***](https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2019/10/04/is-yale-more-dangerous-than-detroit/).

***‘counseling’ is the common response to sexual misconduct***

johnson is a [**recurring critic**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/yales-latest-report-on-its-sexual-misconduct-investigations-shows-more-curiosities/) of the so-called spangler reports. he noted that despite the huge number of reported cases, “only five sexual assault cases were adjudicated” during the most recent six-month period.

four of the five accused students were found guilty, yet the punishments – including short suspensions or probation – “suggest the actual offense was far less severe than the commonly understood definition of sexual assault,” he wrote.

johnson also pointed out that spangler has “removed more and more details from her reports” over the years, including details of “third-party reports involving anonymous alleged victims and accused students.”

the report, released in mid-september, is the 16th since 2012. it covers sexual misconduct reports to yale title ix coordinators, the yale police department, and the [**university-wide committee on sexual misconduct**](https://provost.yale.edu/uwc/procedures) for the first six months of the calendar year.

the half-year report, like its predecessors, “illustrates the danger of lumping everything from groping to forcible rape under the umbrella term ‘sexual assault,’” said harris, whose work with fire concerns issues of free speech and due process on campus.

“if one reads the report, one sees that the university commonly responds to reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault simply by ‘counsel\[ing\] the respondent on appropriate conduct’ — including in response to reports of penetration without consent!” she told *the fix*, highlighting pages 10 and 11 of the report:

>if counseling respondents is truly the university’s response to rape, that is grossly inadequate — but what i suspect this actually reflects is the university’s use of an ambiguous and confusing “affirmative consent” definition, under which sex is not consensual unless there is “positive, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement to engage in specific sexual activity throughout a sexual encounter,” which must be re-affirmed for each new sexual act and which can be “revoked at any time.”

harris argues that definitions such as these are “likely to engender a great deal of confusion among participants in sexual encounters.”

after new york approved an [**affirmative consent law**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/law-professors-line-up-against-new-yorks-new-campus-sexual-assault-law/) that applies only to colleges, fire [**interviewed local students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/) about it, harris noted, learning that “they found the definition highly confusing and were uncertain about what was now prohibited.

“in light of these broad definitions, it is perhaps not surprising that yale has been the subject of at least 6 lawsuits brought by students accused of sexual misconduct,” she said, “alleging they were denied a fair process in their on-campus judicial proceedings.”

***yale more dangerous for female grad students than for undergrads?***

further analysis of the report shows that 146 of the misconduct claims went to the title ix office, which handles informal resolution, while only seven went to the university-wide committee, which actually adjudicates complaints.

the average age of reporting students has risen, both at yale and nationally, according to johnson. he attributes this trend to older students having attended college in an “accuser-friendly title ix environment.”

if valid, this trend would indicate that yale “becomes more dangerous for female students as they age out of the 18-24-year-old cohort.”

in the yale cohort of the association of american universities’ 2015 “[**climate survey**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/westatreportyaleuniversity-1.pdf)” on sexual assault and misconduct, 16.1 percent of yale students reported they had experienced an attempted or completed act of sexual misconduct. spangler is one of the credited designers of this [**national survey**](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/%40%20files/climate%20survey/aau_campus_climate_survey_12_14_15.pdf), which will release 2019 results later this year.

yale might not be alone in the ivy league when it comes to a spike in reported sexual misconduct.

last week harvard university announced the debut of an anonymous title ix reporting form, following apparent interest from the student body. it will allow students to submit title ix complaints against anyone at harvard with no trace back to themselves.

[***the harvard crimson***](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/8/title-ix-anonymous/#.xzycnwshbfu.twitter) notes that the rollout “follows the government department committee on climate change’s recommendation that harvard institute an anonymous reporting system in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against former government professor jorge i. dominguez.”

asked if he saw a connection between the new harvard reporting system and the high number of complaints at yale, johnson told *the fix* in an email that the two situations weren’t connected but rather “problematic for their own reasons.”

“harvard raises issues \[because\] it allows anonymous complaints by witnesses \[with an\] explicit statement that the \[accused\] party won’t learn of the allegation,” he said. in an aside, johnson said harvard’s system “is already less fair than yale’s, which is saying something.”

the core problem with yale’s system is the “extremely broad definition of sexual assault” combined with spangler’s practice of “leaving readers with the implication that all of these allegations have been adjudicated and upheld, even though only a tiny percentage of them are,” he said.
