1,"who knows. but harvard has already started kicking people out. and cornell announced today they are too. and those two areas are significantly less at risk for outbreaks than columbia is 

it’s honestly probably worse for the general public since students have to disperse back to every corner of the us. would probably be safer to keep everyone on campus but the ivies don’t want to ruin their reputation with outbreaks on campus"
2,harvard did... why not columbia?
3,"couple of things from the other side (grad ta/tf here)...

yes, it's definitely unfair for you guys. it is worth noting, though:

* until a few weeks ago, we weren't going to be fully online. quite a few people who'd had terrible experiences in spring had said they'd teach in person if at all possible. (columbia didn't tell us about how 'hybrid' implementation would work until late on, and it was so obviously going to be a disaster that few people went down that route unless forced). the original variant allowed us to offer in-person only classes (columbia only got round to realising that quarantine and no early move-in meant that all in-person classes would have to be hybrid in early august, to much dismay...) 
* equipment - there is limited arts&sciences funding available for teaching staff (but which requires tedious administration to get) to obtain hardware, but it's limited and the hardware then belongs to the university, to be returned at the end of the term. the option which would probably have led to wider take-up would have been the option of 'here's a grant to help you with the cost of a new mic/camera/ipad etc'; columbia didn't go for that, though it was suggested.
* lots of faculty don't teach in the summer. so anyone who wasn't teaching in spring (allowing for research leave, course spread etc, maybe 20%?) hasn't actually experienced the 'joy' of this approach before.
* cuit has been barely visible, to say the least. zoom pro subs weren't done until the last minute, plenty of us still don't have panopto access (and for both z and p, you can't upgrade yourself, you have to file a support ticket with cuit...). the course-shopping thing (courses open from vergil, in theory, in add-drop) wasn't worked on until the last minute either, and while we've been told what the options are, guidance didn't actually go out explaining how to set the different options... the only thing to be seriously thankful about is that the university switched its lms from sakai to canvas about three years ago, because courseworks2 is the one thing that's actually usefully functional (whereas its predecessor was very clunky/dated/slow).
* finally, in defense of people with bad mics etc, it's actually very difficult to run a test session (unless, i don't know, you put each member of your family in a different room with a computer and do a pretend zoom class). if zoom had some version of 'student view' so that we could see/hear a preview of what you're seeing/hearing, it might help with some of the issues.

btw, here's something to ponder. tas are indeed providing tech support again. the grad union was due to strike in spring but called it off because of the beginning of the pandemic - columbia has been doing nothing helpful at the bargaining table (and health insurance had been made worse again for a second consecutive year). columbia's continuing intransigence (we were the only ivy, for instance, to try to tell international grads they'd be unable to be paid if teaching by zoom from abroad for legal reasons (not sure how they expected that argument to fly, when harvard, yale, brown, princeton had all come to the opposite conclusion); the university also enjoys pretending it doesn't own the buildings we live in, so 'can't' do anything about dealing with rent issues for people who left temporarily and got stuck abroad so can't move out, just to take two examples) means the union \*is\* intending to strike this semester. you'd better hope the professors have learnt how to zoom by then..."
4,"coordinates, maybe. it’s not a columbia undergraduate college as i’m guessing you know. my point is that they are two separate institutions and administrations. what barnard, jts, nyu, or harvard does (all of which people have discussed on here) gives no solid indication on what columbia is going to do with their undergrads. for those of us who attend there, we’ll find out when they actually say something and it’s pointless to guess based on the statements of other institutions."
5,"well regardless of your thoughts on barnard's relevancy to columbia, the email specifically focuses on academics. while the information about first year writing and seminar is not relevant to non-barnard first-years, the information about the revised academic calendar and course offerings are relevant to undergrads at cc/seas/gs in addition to barnard. as the email states:

 ""our [calendar for the academic year](https://barnard.edu/academic-calendar) is now set. as always, it is aligned with the calendar of columbia university to ensure that all our students can take full advantage of the myriad options available to undergraduates at both institutions. 

...

the fall semester will begin as planned on september 8 and will end on december 23. we will be flexible and supportive in offering classes in multiple formats. all classes will be offered remotely or in a high-flex modality that allows for both in-class and online delivery of instruction. we are making significant investments in classroom technology and in pedagogic training that will enhance the quality of all of our courses as they are delivered in this new format.""

barnard shares an academic calendar with columbia and given the cross-registration of courses, i would say that that information is relevant. even if you don't plan on taking a single barnard course while you're at columbia, that doesn't mean that the information about the updated calendar isn't relevant. furthermore, what barnard does for courses, does impact students at cc/seas/gs who are planning on taking barnard courses. i fail to see the relevancy of your comparison of this email to what nyu and harvard are doing. jts i would say is relevant given the fact that student enrolled in the duel-degree programs take jts classes. but, regardless of jts, what barnard is doing is an indication of what columbia is doing. 

the point of the post wasn't to debate whether or not barnard is part of columbia. it was to share information that was sent to barnard students with the larger columbia community. even if you don't care about what it says, the point was to just share the information to people who might find it relevant."
6,"i understand that it is officially defined, but i think it is pretty murky in terms of the inconsistent language used to describe the relationship and the fact that students themselves don’t understand the relationship, as evidenced by the above person who thinks barnard’s relation to columbia is comparable to completely unrelated institutions like nyu or harvard."
7,much better than harvard. way to go
8,"tl; dr as far as i can glean:

labs can maybe start reopening over the summer at partial capacity. 

a decision about the fall will be made no later than july 1.

the 2020-2021 school year will be split into 3 terms instead of 2 to allow for more flexibility in class scheduling. how they’ll decide who attends for which term remains a mystery. 

fwiw, harvard med just announced that all first-years will be online in the fall. first semester is primarily for coursework anyway, so i wouldn’t be shocked if columbia takes that route too."

10,"at least for seas, that is not true. we only get to take classes in summer if we stay below 40 credits overall, which means 2 credits less than in previous years. also, the courses offered for juniors/seniors this summer are a joke, at least in the cs department. there’s barely anything offered at all, and personally it feels like columbia is just using this make-believe summer as an excuse to not lower tuition like princeton or harvard did."
11,"fyi: harvard is ""class of 2024"" only on-campus:

harvard said monday that it will open its dorms to the class of 2024 this fall, asking sophomores, juniors, and seniors to seek approval to return.

12,"edit:  actually you know the language is pretty unclear... i can't tell if they're actually offering classes in person or just allowing people back on campus.  don't know why people would bother going there though, if no classes there.

it's more on the actual harvard site.  the entire senior class is on campus, and they say half of the freshman class (but they're all invited).  then lastly, whoever has to come to campus due to whatever reasons.

other things to note:

- tuition remains at 100% (fully expect this)

- extra financial aid to help with housing outside of campus (i would be surprised)

- testing every 3 days."

14,"where the fuck am i gonna stay if they kick me out? just go buy a ticket back to my country in a week's notice? i don't have that kind of money. and my country has no confirmed cases yet, so i guess i'll be the f\*cker who possibly brings it?

by the way, i think making people travel is worse. they are just trying to avoid the responsibility. if anything happens to one of the students or their families; well, they are not even in massachusetts anymore, so who can blame fucking harvard, right?"
15,hold up... harvard is kicking people out of the dorms?
16,sending students back to all corners of the us is such a bad idea. things would work out better is students just stayed on campus (but remotely accessed classes) but harvard doesn’t want any association with the virus. literally sacrificing public health for their reputation. i imagine the rest of the ivies will follow soon
17,"do you have a source that says it's mandatory? [this letter](https://www.harvard.edu/covid-19-moving-classes-online-other-updates) says: 

> students are **asked** not to return to campus after spring recess and to meet academic requirements remotely until further notice. students who need to remain on campus will also receive instruction remotely and must prepare for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions.

(emphasis mine)"
18,"i think it was on fast company.  harvard told them that they're aware not everyone can afford to just move, so they're working on financial assistance, among other issues.

it seems like they're still pretty unclear how to logistically enact the dispersal.  ""mandatory"" may be a strong word."
19,"ok ima be real with you buddy. im just here to troll. but i should probably clear up some facts regarding his books.

they're probably going to #2/8 because of the media hype surrounding him and his work, and the number of people reading about (quantum) physics is small enough that media hype can significantly affect numbers.

i've also read his work. as someone with a good, university level background in physics and mathematics, i can immediately tell that his work is complete crankery. as some other people have outlined, he seems to be good at math (honestly, who isn't?) but he doesn't know physics and he's at the stage where he's become so convinced and in love with his own theory that he can't see how flawed his argument is.

i get that you inbred white supremacists love to latch onto anything a fellow supremacist says or does, but i figured i should warn you against adopting and praising some very bad ""physics"".

23,"would love to get some feedback + opinion on my profile.

demographic: indian (f), low-income family (10-11k/annum), private school

•probably going to major in either sociology or political science.


statistics: 3.7 gpa, sat 1300 (taking again in december), somehow the top 1% of my class [my stats are really bad, but its mostly because maths pulls me down. i'm trying to increase them as i still have a year left with me]

ecs: 

1. founder of a youth based activist organisation working to uplift marginalised people. we've run 3 successful campaigns and 1 petition is still going on. reached about 10,000 people with it, and have received appreciation from an indian parliamentarian, ex-irish prez's talk show and an american comedian.

2. have my own talk show, which is sort of a blend between politics and literature. it isn't massively famous, but its decent. 

3. taught rural girls about healthy menstrual habits for a year, and also running a political campaign on a local level before elections.

4. ambassador for an england-based non-profit. i'm one of the many from my country, but i believe i'm the only one from my region.

5. speaker/panelist at various seminars on activism and social justice.

6. research paper. its 'extremely interesting' as per my professor, but i have mixed feelings on it.

7. i've done a lot of online courses from ivy league colleges and other organisations on social justice and politics (they were graded, and my grades were 73%, 94% and 96%), and was selected as a delegate to a college level seminar hosted by harvard.

8. chaired several muns, but i'm not sure if i'll put it on the application.

24,"the dirty little secret is that a lot of top schools have a cash cow program that leverages the prestigious name for people willing to pay. sps is columbia’s version of harvard extension, penn’s lps, etc. people generally understand the difference between these programs and the university proper."
25,"the most prestigious schools in the world are **columbia sps, yale law and harvard med**, in that order. these three are in a league of their own and completely overshadow all other schools. together they are called the **holy trinity, or cyh**, of higher education, with yale law coming a close 2nd but struggling to match the sheer academic horsepower of columbia sps. critics often point out that harvard med, being totally overrated simply because it has ""harvard"" in its name, shouldn't even be included in the acronym. some even go as far as saying that sps should be in its own category because it has just dominated the world of higher education since its inception in 1995.

every child in north america has heard of these schools; everyone and their uncle want to get in these schools. for my whole life, i have tried to understand all the hype around these schools. my dad went to columbia. he told me what he remembered of columbia sps, a school which, in his mind held truth itself in its giant electronic fist. since i was a child, the name columbia sps meant more than just a school, it's a faith, an obstinate and audacious hope. that's why i came to columbia for undergrad. many times i walked by the sps building, i truly felt its palpable existence, the vigorous pulse, the every quiver of its beating heart screaming the very definition of excellence. it was my dream.

i spent my years working really hard and not really caring about grades all that much as long as i gave my best in everything. i bought all kinds of sps merchandise. i slept in my sps shirts because that made me feel closer to my dream. i spent a lot of time debating with friends and professors. i turned down invitations to social gatherings, thinking all the hard work would pay off someday and that those other people who went out so often would someday wish they'd studied as hard as i did. and one day, they will all look up to me to be the one student who gets to walk into the gate of columbia sps.

well, i ended up with a 4.1 gpa, perfect gre scores and all the academic awards that i could've possibly laid my hands on. but still, sps rejected me. that, really hurt. when i received the rejection letter, it felt like a thousand knives stabbing right through my heart. whether i fainted or not, i don't remember. over the years, i kept asking myself, what i could have done differently, what i could have done better. maybe if i did a little bit more, a little bit different, i would have had the big sps letters on my resume. it hurts to know that despite all the work i put in, i wasn't able to achieve my lifelong ambition to attend a tippy top school like columbia sps. in the end, i settled with yale law. people did come and congratulate me. from their envious eyes i knew their admirations were real. i did get most things i wanted from yale law: respect, money, prestige. but deep down, i know, it is no columbia sps.

but now i am not that sad anymore. i have got over it. some goals are never supposed to be accomplished. they only exist, because they constantly push people to be the better versions of themselves, to never give up dreaming and reaching for the best. for me, for everyone, that is what sps is really all about."
26,"yes - i've read the articles before and i have first hand experience with it. from my conversations with other international students, sps (or other continuing education programs) are quite well known, not just in the us, but worldwide for being the cash cow program for universities to gain additional revenue - or in the case of columbia, to fund their expensive ventures. however, there are also lots of professionals at sps to boost their career-related knowledge so i won't write it off as useless or anything. i don't think sps has the same level of access to columbia resources, for example, they don't have access to the alumni directory as far as i know. i also don't think it would hurt the brand name as much, to be honest, as many other schools are doing the same thing. but i definitely am aware that other masters students might be negatively affected by sps' reputation overseas. harvard and penn both have bachelor's granting schools that are much less selective and rigorous than gs (which i think is the best program of its kind - i was cc). you can even do a bachelors degree online now at penn, for example, without having to go to class in person. they are of course, not without controversies, but i think columbia's liberality in churning out masters degrees is a whole new level. like now they're creating a climate school? as much as i am aware of climate change (and strongly support what the school has been doing to combat it), do we really need another school for it?"
27,"as far as i know, most people in china or other parts of asia are very well aware that masters programs are a lot less selective than undergrad just like in their home countries too (the same kind of stigma against grad students exist in hku, peking, tsinghua, nus, and tokyo u too) and my friends told me that recruiters at major companies now look at your first degree (even if you obtained a masters from harvard or oxford, not to mention columbia) simply because the number of people with foreign masters degrees (especially at t-10 and t-20s) are literally flooding the job markets in their home countries. those who suffer the most are the masters students paying $70000 a year or more, thinking they could pad their resumes, but are instead getting a subpar career outcome, for example, the inability to find a job in the us, and have to settle for a less desirable one at home. the reputation of the undergrad institution among people ""in the know"" are just fine; the undergraduate colleges are still getting the brightest students from the most well-connected families. even though this doesn't affect me in the slightest, i'm still moderately concerned about the mid-to-long term impact on the employability of the graduate programs if the school keeps generating subpar programs like some of the previous posts have suggested."
28,"you keep telling yourself that. it is just a fact that masters programs and undergrad are completely different things. for example, you are not considered an ivy league student just because you go to a master's program (or any graduate school unless you also go there for undergrad; aamof, at harvard law, students who didn't go to an ivy league for undergrad are referred to as ""non-ivy harvard students"" by our school senate), and you will not have access to the same resources and opportunities as an undergrad, such as exclusive job fairs, ocis, internal alum connections, legacy status for your offspring and many of the privileges and benefits that are often associated with the an ivy league degree. it is just a fact. if you try to deny that, you really need to research more about this and just get over it. now, nobody is making a claim that all master's programs are cash cows that anyone with money can get in. we are saying a lot of them have low admissions standards, regardless what school/department these programs are in. are there ""masters-level programs with competitive admissions""? sure. but very very few. graduate admissions at even the best graduate schools/programs are no where as grueling as the undergraduate admissions process, where the odds are incredibly slim given the sheer number of applicants. case in point, the all prestigious columbia law school has 15% admissions rate whereas the undergrad has less than 6%, let alone masters. as far as i know, at seas the only reputable master's program is the ms in financial engineering, the rest like operations research, business analytics and data science are notorious for having overly-generous admissions standards. if you don't believe me, you can look this up on wallstreetoasis and see what people think of these programs. but let's be honest, even at ms in financial engineering, how many of the students are ivy league undergrads, and how many of them could have gotten into columbia for undergrad? if you were in an seas masters, you should know. however, what is special about columbia is that it offers programs that anyone with a beating pulse and a fat wallet can get in. to name a few: all sps programs, ma in stats, ms in electrical engineering, most tc programs, most sipa programs. these are what we mean by ""cash cow"" programs that are hurting the columbia reputation. also, a friendly reminder, in your flair you listed ""seas'20"", i hope you graduated from seas undergrad class of 2020 since that is what ""seas'20"" exclusively refers too. otherwise, it could be very misleading. (not trying to be a snob, but you should check out columbia engineering's linkedin and see how they distinguish master's students from undergrads)"
29,"i agree with you on the facts here, but i don't agree that the university brand is still intact. it is true that the most selective jobs such as those at prestigious investment banking and consulting firms do view undergrads separately from their master's and master's students for the most part don't have a shot as these places. it is also true that master's degrees are considered much less a sign of accomplishment than undergrad in asia among those ""in the know""(though i will qualify this by saying this ""undergrad pedigree"" thing only exists in the finance and consulting industries as far as i know). but the strength of a university brand doesn't depend on the upper echelon of it though does it? the vast majority of jobs exist outside of mbb and top ibd where 90% of columbia undergrads don't get those jobs either. most companies do not have the luxury to select candidates from the most talented pool (like prestigious undergrad, or mba only) and to them the value of a master's degree and bachelor's becomes a lot harder to parse, and those are the jobs the majority of undergrads get. the overflow of master's degrees in the job market will certainly hurt the perception of the columbia name among the less elite employers, and the large middle ground of columbia undergrads is the most vulnerable to this effect. for now though the very best students at cc or seas will still do just fine, i cannot say the same for an average one. also you mentioned that harvard, mit, jhu, oxford, and many other t-20 schools offer similar cash cow programs. true, but no one is nearly as brazen columbia in creating this many of them. and precisely because of columbia, the other schools are overshadowed and no one talks about them. the discussions in asia always focus on columbia being a diploma mill as opposed to master's programs in general. i have taiwanese friends tell me that columbia has a terrible reputation over there. people at the top should really fix this."
30,"it's the same with mit sloan's mfin program. my friend told me the program is like 60-70% chinese alone and is not as well regarded at home despite the mit brand name. also seen as a ""cash cow"" (in 2020) even for one of the most well regarded universities worldwide.

there is a list circulating on the chinese internet about the 27 ""cash cow"" programs in the us to avoid - columbia had 6: ma in statistics, ms in social work, ms in electrical engineering, ms in actuarial science, ms in computer engineering, and the master of public administration at sipa; jhu came in second with 5 programs (mfin, master of public policy, master in financial mathematics, ms in applied economics and ms in electrical engineering); followed by washu in st. louis with 4 programs, penn, uchicago, cornell, and harvard (education and public health) all had 2; yale's public health was also on the ranking... so yeah, every top school has its fair share apparently (with the exception of princeton, which barely has a masters program to begin with), with columbia taking the lead so far; the caveat is that the list is really based on the percentage of international students the programs have accepted, acceptance rate, and not so much with the actual strengths of the program."
31,"right, i don't speak chinese well but i can read it well enough to understand the nuances (thanks to my ealac courses). it seems to me that a vast majority of the comments are not complaining about how ""watered down"" it is but are mocking the question that it is ""watered down"". furthermore, most of the qualifying comments direct to certain schools and graduate programs being ""watered down"" and have refrained from attacking the school as a whole. one guy even said ""only unless you went to princeton (which is known for its highly selective grad programs and gives out very few masters degrees per year), you really have no right to criticize columbia,"" taking a jab at h/y for their ""watered down"" programs too. you do also realize that zhihu (other than being a hotbed of nationalist, racist, and sexist rhetoric) is widely mocked on the chinese social media as a super pretentious platform where the average self-reported income is well above 1 million rmb, and everyone has a phd from peking/tsinghua or harvard?"
32,"right - i agree totally with you. (ps: also zhihu is not so reliable a source because there are so many government trolls spewing false information) but i think calling its reputation ""ruined"" or ""destroyed"" is quite an exaggeration from the mere evidence on online posts and i doubt that is has become a hard-established ""fact"" but definitely a recent trend worthy of our concerns. i'm surprised no grad student has written more about this on spec, or even raised concerns at senate meetings. apparently, the reason why so many of those programs are flourishing is because each school's (and even departments too) adcom and administration is independent from one another. also their budgets are independent so they must do their best to survive so you'd see the more cash-strapped departments, especially gsas, setting up all those cash cow programs to sustain operations of cc and hiring of new faculty. a few of my friends actually wrote an op-ed back in the day telling seas to cut down its graduate student enrollment because it's negatively impacting the undergrad experience. i don't know if they've listened, but i think the over-enrollment of seas undergrads through the 3+2 program was the tipping point that many alums voiced strong concerns, and raised an eyebrow from higher ups, finally clamping down on the ""backdoor"" issue. another reason is that seas has raised enough money to sustain its own operations (really major turnaround under dean boyce as evident in the new facilities and major surge in engineering rankings) so it no longer needs the 3+2 program for funds (truth is that almost no aid is given to 3+2 students). if they can do that, i'm sure more active steps would be taken to reinforce the reputation and selectivity of the institution itself. i also think that one of the reasons is the building of manhattanville and prezbo's many flashy ventures are straining the resources of the institution, putting gsas especially on the back burner. one of the reasons columbia's endowment hasn't grown as much is mainly because of the building of the new campus, which costs a lot of money, like 2/3 of the school's present endowment. also the school spends a lot on faculty salaries and research so that it punches beyond its weight with such little endowment compared to its peers. other schools with columbia-level endowment (especially northwestern, notre dame, penn etc.) are expanding, but not to such an extent of building an entirely new campus on the island of manhattan (arguably the one place in the world with the most expensive real estate that comes with lots of legal complications), and similarly are they not offering the same level of salary to attract top-notch faculty (in terms of professors' salary, columbia's in the league of harvard and stanford)."
33,"hi there, 

so i'm statistically in the lower pool of applicants. my gpa is a 4.4 (4.0 unweighted) but my sat score is a 1320 (710 ebrw and 610 math). the math score is because i was never really a great student in middle school (i also taught myself 8th grade and 3/4 of freshman year) so my fundamentals were a little shaky. digressing, my ap scores were: 

ap lang - 5 

apush - 5 

ap physics i - 3 

on top of that, i participated in a state selective internship (200/2400 selected) and worked with an alumni at my highschool for a film she directed i've got some other pretty solid extracurriculars (2 varsity sports, art honor society for photography, studied music production at harvard last summer) . i also have a columbia alum writing one of my letters. 

the sat score is something i'm really worried about. i want to apply ed because i feel like my chances are better but feel like test score wise, i'm on the weaker side. i take physics and math i tests in november and am wondering if it is worth studying my ass off for another sat and applying regular decision. columbia is my #1 choice and i am really confident in my essays but if this low sat score is the *end all be all* stat then please lmk. thanks guys. good luck to the rest of my fellow seniors and i hope you guys end up exactly where you want to!"
34,"it's honestly just lack of shared activities.  people really don't have a group of friends unless they seek them out through clubs.  and clubs often reject you if you don't have the requisite prior experience. facing nyc w/o friends is tough for anyone - not just columbia students.  check out bellevue if you don't believe me.

harvard at least forces you to make friends in entryways, etc."
35,"i saw this yesterday, and emailed the isso to see if we needed to get a new i-20, given harvard’s announcement. this was their response: 

“columbia is offering hybrid classes to all incoming students. you do not need a new i-20, the one you have is currently valid. we will be in touch if any further fall 2020 guidance for new students is received, and with any additional support we are able to provide.”"
36,isso currently says no because cu unlike harvard will be hybrid (not all online)
37,"learn how to skim. my teacher went undergraduate harvard and graduate uchicago. he offered the vital information of reading the introduction, conclusion, and the one chapter probably most relevant to your argument. although for literature, read the entire novel."
38,"if it did, they bumped up the capacity to 60% vs harvard's 40% even though we're more densely packed and theoretically should be less dense"
39,"i know quite a few people who were admitted off the waitlist. i think columbia doesn’t put that many people on the waitlist (in comparison to harvard who adds like everyone) so if you write a good letter of interest, you’ll have a p good chance of getting in"
40,"maybe i just haven't had the same experiences, because i had an incredibly difficult time getting an appeal two years in a row and getting transparent information from the department even before covid. perhaps most people aren't having these issues and that's great. but there aren't even enough work-study jobs normally for students who are eligible, so i can't imagine there will be enough for all the students who are remote. and hopefully, they will release another program like the summer grant for those who can't complete jobs, but there's no information on it yet. 

to me, the fact that some people fall through the cracks is the part that isn't good enough. we have so so much admin, but they can't think of what i don't think are crazy, albeit possibly outlier, scenarios when creating the plans and dispersing this information? even if they didn't change anything but actually released info about the average success of appealing or talked about possible plans they were thinking about to help students be financially secure (like another grant to replace work for the school year), i likely wouldn't feel the same way. harvard released their off-campus living amount when announcing the plans for the school year, and consistent information given on a reasonable timeline, in conjunction with academic decisions (because for me the two go together), without me having to constantly check websites and reddit for updates since they don't email us these things, would just generally make the situation better even if the information didn't change."
41,"somebody wrote something stupid on a chalkboard. everybody relax. these overblown, overly sensitive reactions are why grownups laugh at universities.

columbia is not a racist institution. you all are thinking of harvard."
42,"given the history of the us and it’s policies such as the [chinese exclusion act](https://i.imgur.com/lnlty9q.jpg), it all starts with something small like this. “武汉病毒隔离区(wuhan virus quarantine area) keep out!”  is obviously targeted at chinese students. definitely not overblown at all. 

how do you think the racist policies at harvard started?"
43,"""harvard"" is beginning to appear right above ours..."
44,uc berkeley>harvard>columbia
45,bro just say you went to harvard...
46,harvard did cancel orientation in april.
47,"for those of you who can't read it:

*you’ve read a lot over the past year about kids who end up in the ivy league because of their parents’ wealth and wiles, kids with obscene advantages. i’d like to introduce you to another kind of kid who landed there. her name is wadzanayi mayiseni. she goes by wadzi.*

*before wadzi, 19, arrived at columbia university last month for a summer bridge program to prepare for her first year, she’d never been to the united states. she’d never left africa. she’s from zimbabwe, one of the poorest countries in the world, where her mother, who raised her without any help from her father, has been out of a steady job since wadzi was 9.*

*when wadzi was 12, she found out she had bone cancer, which meant not just chemotherapy but the amputation of most of her left leg. i asked her how, psychologically and emotionally, that changed her. she said it made her more determined.*

*“you’re not defined by the things that hold you back,” she told me. “you’re defined by how you rise above them.” she refused to be placed in classes for disabled children and later figured out how to get a scholarship to one of zimbabwe’s most esteemed private high schools. then she figured out how to translate that into the best college education possible.*

*she got help with that last part from the nonprofit* [*united student achievers program*](http://www.edmattersafrica.org/united-students-achievers-program/)*, which for two decades has identified disadvantaged high school students of enormous promise in zimbabwe, coached them through applying to top-notch colleges outside of their country and steered them toward futures they never imagined.*

*and by “disadvantaged,” i mean students who in some cases grew up herding livestock and in other cases were strangers to computers. i mean orphans: largely because of the aids epidemic, about a third of zimbabwe’s usap students have lost both parents. i met one such student, getrude makurumidze, last year; by the time she was 9, her mother, father and 6-month-old sister had died from complications related to aids. she then bounced among the members of her extended family who could afford at a given moment to keep her. she nonetheless went on to graduate from bryn mawr and is now in medical school at georgetown university.*

*there are usap programs in other developing countries. they not only provide students with the guidance necessary to apply to foreign colleges but also help with application fees and financial aid forms. zimbabwe’s usap was the model and remains the gold standard. it has sent more than 400 students abroad, mostly to the united states, where the schools they’ve attended include stanford, harvard, yale, m.i.t., the university of chicago, duke, pomona — you name it. many went on to earn ph.d.s. many became physicians. six won rhodes scholarships.* 

*that’s worth dwelling on for several reasons, starting with this one: zimbabwe is the sort of place that president trump had in mind when he* [*used a fecal epithet*](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/shithole-countries/580054/) *for poor, black and (to his thinking) worthless countries, but there is obviously great potential there, needing only to be recognized and nurtured. countries don’t fall neatly into categories: good versus bad sources of immigrants. reality is more complicated. talent is universal.*

*for example, in another desperate part of africa, somaliland, there’s a remarkable school,* [*abaarso*](http://www.abaarsoschool.org/)*, that jonathan starr, an american philanthropist, opened in 2009. it educates children in grades 7 through 12. its alumni have been admitted to and received financial aid from harvard, yale, columbia, brown, m.i.t., swarthmore.*

*those institutions’ receptiveness is another reason i’m writing this. yes, america’s richest colleges stay that way by giving* [*special consideration to families with the means to make big donations*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/03/13/he-investigated-how-rich-buy-their-way-into-elite-colleges-some-took-his-book-how-guide/)*. but they simultaneously* [*use some of their wealth*](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-colleges-most-financial-aid-ranked-2018-11#17-brown-university-9)*, if not quite enough, to educate students who cannot contribute a dime to their tuition.*

*zimbabwe’s usap is also the story of the difference that one person can make. it’s run by and was the brainchild of rebecca zeigler mano, an american who married a zimbabwean, moved to zimbabwe and couldn’t just shrug off the country’s misery.*

*“there’s a big gap — a big chasm — between the talent that we have in zimbabwe and the opportunities,” she said on the first of two occasions over the last 13 months when i spoke with her in new york. she returns frequently to america, in part to raise funds.*

*her program has become so well known and widely respected in zimbabwe that every year she gets 700 to 800 applications for about 35 spots. “i like to tell harvard that we are more competitive than they are,” she said. many of the applicants are from remote rural areas; she tirelessly crisscrosses the country to interview them.*

*she also builds networks in the united states for the students who come here, so that they have places to go on school breaks — they can’t afford to fly home — and so that there are people to help with things like sheets and blankets. at the start she didn’t factor in their entire array of needs and got reports that usap students were sleeping on bare dormitory-room beds.*

*“she’s one of my life heroes,” said bruce wharton, who was the public-affairs officer in the american embassy in zimbabwe when usap began. “i don’t know anybody who has done so much on an individual, personal level to make our world better.”*

*her ambitions are expanding: she plans to open a usap boarding school in zimbabwe next year. money permitting, it will give up to 50 zimbabwean students their 11th- and 12th-grade educations, so that they’re in the best shape possible to thrive when they go to college abroad.*

*she told me that she also hoped that the school would give the kids a deeper investment in zimbabwe. in her ideal scenario, they bring the knowledge that they’ve acquired in college back to a country with a shortage of leaders, of innovators, of hope.*

*wadzi said that she could envision getting a medical degree in the united states, becoming a pediatric oncologist and then returning home to help children who confront medical scares like the one that she survived.*

*i asked her about her impressions of america so far. she mentioned a trip to see, up close, a world-famous landmark that was familiar from so many pictures: the statue of liberty.*

*“it was right in front of me,” she said. “i was awe-struck.”*

*“you know the crown represents seven continents?” she added, referring to the spikes that radiate from it. she was transfixed by the fact that an icon so central to one country would allude to all the others; by the generosity of that symbolism; by its inclusiveness. “i remember really smiling,” she told me, “because i felt a part of that.”*

*she said that the tablet that lady liberty holds brought to mind studying, learning, growing. that, too, made her smile. “i’m here for an education,” she said. “and there’s a statue embodying what i’ve come for.”*"
48,"this is probably related to his digital presidential library project which will most likely have offices in uchi, harvard and columbia. i can see him having a new made-up position for the library and not actually work as a professor. although i personally hope he becomes dean of the law school. that would be amazing. "
49,why would he become the law school dean? he went to harvard law.
50,"cc. compsci here. stop stressing over it. i've hired literally 350+ people in 20 years in industry, and it comes down to the person apart from the gpa. there are thousands of harvard jerks with 4.0 inflated gpa out there, zero of whom are worth anything in an interview or job situation - their drive ended when they got into harvard. keep at it. take what interests you and do your best. crush the core. then find the right thing for you. reply direct if you want to talk more."
51,"i just spent way too much time looking at this and its pretty clear this guy is a troll.  also i have to admit it, he's a pretty good one.

the real dead giveaway is this comment-

 

first i want to thank you for stepping up and saying such nice things about sps. i personally have never heard of such an acronym ""cyh"", but it is nice to know that it is a thing. we are significantly younger compared to the other two schools but as you said, our academic horsepower is unmatched. though objectively i have to say yale law and harvard med are probably more famous than us currently, but we have every hope to surpass them in that regard as well in the near future.

i am sorry for your rejection. i know it must hurt. but what's important is to understand why you got rejected, and learn from it. at sps, a considerable part the admission decisions, decisive even, is your softs. the admission process at sps is not nearly as straightforward as for law school where scores always come first. these softs include your extracurricular activities, your work experience, your intangibles, and many other factors beyond your control. having perfect gpas and gres alone won't make the cut. rather, it's only a necessity. maybe it was the fact that you turned down invitations to social gatherings that later became the kryptonite to your application, because leadership skills and the ability to interact with all walks of life are highly emphasized in sps's admission decisions. without those, chances are you are in for becoming part of the larger denominator of the admissions rate. so, even though it was not the best outcome you hoped for, you could still learn a lot from it. at the end of the day, it is not where you go to school that matters the most, it's where you can find the best match. maybe sps is just not a good match for you. our students are not necessarily smarter or more accomplished than other schools. we also have tons of stress, pressure and hate (as you can obviously see from the posts here) to deal with. the fact that yale law took you means that they found you to be a good match, and that is where you can get the most out the school to unleash all your potential. good luck!"
52,harvard just announced 6 of their graduate schools will be fully online for fall. i wonder if they are doing that to offer undergrads hybrid or in person classes.
53,"harvard's kennedy school and law school announced in the past few days that they would be exclusively remote :

[https://www.hks.harvard.edu/more/about/leadership-administration/deans-office/deans-presentations/fall-semester-harvard-kennedy](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/more/about/leadership-administration/deans-office/deans-presentations/fall-semester-harvard-kennedy)

[https://hls.harvard.edu/hls-fall-term-2020/](https://hls.harvard.edu/hls-fall-term-2020/)

and i think columbia has modeled this type of decisions after theirs before, so there's a good chance that we might be fully remote as well :\\"
54,"this should be the top comment. palo alto is basically just stanford. new york is a whole other beast when it comes to reopening a university and bringing back thousands of students.

six of harvard’s graduate schools just went online, and that might be a better representation of columbia’s coming response given both are located in urban areas."
55,"boston university just announced they’ll have in-person classes in the fall. same city as harvard (sort of), except even more urban."
56,mit and harvard just announced that they’re moving all students out by this sunday/end of spring break bc of virus concerns...
57,"hey, i’m a prospective student in the class of 2024. i only have a couple of days to make my commitment decision so i am trying to do as much research as possible.

i’m also planning on major in financial economics, but i’m a little confused as to how theoretical the major is. my ideal major would be hyper specialized in finance like wharton’s, so many normal econ degrees aren’t all the appealing to me. how theoretical is the major, and how deep does it go into applications in finance. is the major more or less a normal ivy league econ degree (like harvard or yale) with a few finance classes as electives, or is closer to a wharton or stern finance concentration? thank you!"
58,"current 3l. like pretty much everyone that goes to cls, i had the choice between the two. i have loved my time here, and it got me exactly where i want in terms of my career. i have found the majority of the professors to be good at their jobs. there are of course exceptions.   
   
biggest downsides in my mind are the crap administration. it is really pretty awful, the different offices are bloated and yet seemingly understaffed at the same time? it seems like you can never get a clear answer to anything. also, the facilities suck. the building is ugly and the size of the school means fighting for study space. just try walking through jg at noon on a weekday, it is a madhouse.   
   
biggest positives: if you want to do big law, there is no school better equipped to get you to the top firms besides perhaps harvard. the v10s doors are wide open, and even the prestigious boutique firms get a lot of cls students joining. i enjoyed my classmates, have a strong group of friends from here. i think it gets a bit “cliquey” because of how cls puts students into their legal methods classes with their sections. for the first few weeks it is only 1ls on campus and everyone is in a single class with their section. it makes people gravitate to the people they know. i didn’t see it as a downside thought, i really enjoyed it. finally, i actually liked the location a lot. it is a lot easier to get good housing at cls than nyu (unless you are willing to pay a boatload). it is also nice to not be smack dab in the heart of the city all the time. nyu is in a super busy area, when you are on columbia’s campus you feel like you can escape from the noise sometimes.   
   
happy to answer any more questions."
59,"columbia is really hard. it also prepares you better than other schools, let alone ivies, for the real world. i've hired from all the best schools, and there is no better education for the real world than columbia. working with others, understanding material, expressing complex concepts in real world languages, being a teammate - i attribute my success to the challenges i faced at columbia. a b/b+ average at columbia is better than anything at nearly anything at any school, save maybe mathematics at princeton. 93% of harvard resumes say ""with honors"" - it means nothing. keep at it, friend!"
60,"if you want some reassurance, columbia is higher than standford on the (completely bullshit) usnews rankings list.

both are amazing schools, and you're absolutely doing the right thing by thinking about where you'd fit better. if you'd gotten into harvard, i'd urge you to be a little less hasty, but it's not even clear to me whether stanford is more or less prestigious than columbia. ultimately, it's far more constructive to spend 4 years at a place where you feed off the energy, than at a school chosen solely based on its perceived prestige.

ngl the prestige does feel nice though. in my experience, the only people who don't know columbia are townies who live in flyover country. people who matter, know."
61,"it varies. i hail from the midwest and there are people don't know any of the ivies outside of harvard. they're more familiar with sports. one guy thought florida state was in the ivy league because of football. however, those who are familiar with prestigious colleges are familiar with columbia. i get the ""holy bleep"" or ""you must be really smart"" reaction more often than not. 

around new england and the coast, everyone is familiar with columbia and all the other big names. it seems everywhere else, it varies. i remember some years ago there was a kid that lived near me got into cornell. he got a newspaper article. there was another one that got into stanford. nobody had a clue. the bottom line is that those who will matter for your purposes will know."
62,"internationally: great reputation.

for grad school: great reputation.

for employers: good reputation \[but with pretty great on-campus recruiting\].

among social acquaintances: not as shocking as harvard, which is probably a good thing depending on who you are looking to hang out with. in some places it won't raise an eyebrow any more than another private liberal arts university."
63,"i honestly think it's rare for employers to really care about your undergraduate degree after graduation. for jobs coming out of school, i think it's really helpful to be at columbia, but after that you stand on your own merits. i also don't think there is a strong columbia network outside of a few industries, like finance.   


some schools, like harvard and yale, seem to really get your application to the top, even after graduation.

  
i could be wrong about that though, that's just based on personal observations of a small number of graduates who did not go to grad school afterwards."
64,"much easier to get internships, interviews and jobs in finance at columbia. wall st and other banks come to hire on campus pretty often and you get a lot of onsite interviews. it is the school to be if you want easy access to finance jobs. i think most ppl that has an ivy school background on wall st are harvard, yaloe, mit and columbia. don't really see many from princeton. the columbia wall st. and finance network is truly humongous."
65,"that’s really unfortunate they misrepresent that. it puts them at odds with fact. and don’t worry about that guy. barnard is one of the historical seven sisters schools. it is not the ivy league exactly but the history is intertwined. i personally wish barnard had just done what harvard did with radcliffe years ago. as it sits, it is what it is. columbia has three colleges with one affiliate."
66,"this is really well put, and i agree.

i got a prestigious internship this past summer. i had just graduated from nyu, but was about to start columbia in august for another degree.

on my first day, my supervisor showed me around and introduced me to everyone “this is runs_for_beer, she goes to columbia.” now he wasn’t technically correct (at the time), but i didn’t admonish him for it either. he was sooo thrilled to have me, i think. one of his coworkers sources her interns directly from harvard, and i think they’re in competition quite a bit.

anyway, in the end, the ivy gets the interview. not sure if where matters, but some have bigger name brands than others. regardless, it’s a great advantage to have, and op shouldn’t necessarily transfer."
67,"you had to be added by the school, but i suppose it was possible for people with common names to get in...

you joke, but i read harvard actually did that."
68,"just looked it up.. was it something like ""55 successful harvard law application essays"" ? but that's more like something published with the authors' permission... in this case, the essays were leaked, then hastily taken down from the google doc... anyone could've downloaded all 78 (?) then sold them... idunno.. it just seems worse"
69,"i am not saying that it’s their fault, i’m just saying that the experience this semester is certainly not worth $40,000, so why not figure out a fair way to compensate us? we’re not just paying to be in class. happy the university has made the right decisions so far (unlike harvard) but there are more decisions to be made. glad you feel like you’re getting the experience you deserve, but others (maybe mostly seniors) are not."
70,"i took intensive japanese at harvard many years ago. it met twice as often as the regular japanese course. it was my third language, after french and german. it is a fascinating but extremely difficult language for an english speaker. the structure of the language is different. the writing system is complex. there are no familiar words, not even ""faux amis,"" as in french. spoken properly, japanese is spoken very rapidly. one of the teachers used to beat the rhythm on the desk with a ruler. she knew that if we didn't get into the habit of speaking quickly we'd never be able to use our japanese with native speakers.

if you have a reasonable knack for language, you can learn, but you have to keep up.

columbia has had distinguished scholars of japanese language and culture and it's a major university so i imagine it has excellent japanese classes."
71,"how do the columbia courses compare with harvard and yale's cs50? for example, someone mentioned, in regard to the columbia honors course, that one should be a good note-taker. i believe cs50 provides videos and transcripts of all the lectures."
72,"you're telling me i'm not able to comprehend a thing which is not a fact but is actually your opinion and is the crucial matter here because it's not an opinion i share. that's about all there is to it 

plenty of people leave school with debt. it sucks but it doesn't mean anything vis a vis being entitled to financial aid. 


feels like you're fishing really hard here to make yourself feel like a victim what with ""the only reason they could be disagreeing with me is prejudice""-- prejudice against what, exactly? i don't donate to harvard undergrad either but that hardly counts as prejudice"
73,"personally for me it's not as bad as i had thought before coming. it's definitely stressful though. a big part of the campus culture is how everyone is a type a go-getter, and that mindset pushes you to do a ton (an extra class, tons of ecs, internships...) that just pile up and become too much. you can definitely not do as much but there's this sense that you're lagging behind everyone else. besides the fact that columbia classes in general are supposed to be on the harder side (vs other comparable schools *cough*harvard) and we have to take a heavier courseload (5 classes a term in cc, 5-6 in seas when the normal at other schools is 4)."
74,"but latin honors are very restricted compared to similar schools. when i graduated, cc limited cum laude to the top 25% of the class; harvard gave cum laude or higher nods to 91% of their class!"
75,what does your ending up a loser have to do with whether columbia is a competitive environment? do you really think the job prospects are better for students at brown? should op be suicidal like you were because he or she doesn't have a full ride at harvard?
76,"unfortunately not just me. most of us have shitty lives, we columbia alumns. math majors working shit jobs as analysts, unemployed philosophy majors and engineers. 

jesus, what a scam. 

brown probably isn't much better. not harvard either, to be honest (though you'll have more opportunities with harvard). the thing is, i'm not sure what we could have done differently not to have such shitty lives. "
77,"these are my two cents on the topic. first of all congratulations on being admitted to 2 very prestigious programs. 

it sounds like you’re an international student, and i can tell you from the get go that harvard might have a better (albeit undeserved) reputation abroad.

both places will offer you an amazing education, no doubt. the feel of the school, or rather the campus, could be different though. columbia is at the heart of one of the most interesting places where to live, new york. harvard, being in cambridge, slightly outside boston, does have a bit of a suburban feeling to it.
at columbia, you’re surrounded by buildings... tall ones. having moved here from florida, it becomes a bit of a drag after a few weeks. colleagues of mine who moved from chicago are just fine with that.

another thing to consider (extremely relevant if you’re gearing yourself towards a career in humanities or social sciences, slightly irrelevant for engineering and sciences), is the intellectual genealogy you’re stepping in. columbia does have a bit more of a leftist orientation compared to conservative harvard. "
78,"hey! i'm a ""named scholar"" as well - just a different type.

i can put you in touch with a cp davis scholar if you want.  pm me.

tl;dr: it's a scholarship and you have access to the ""columbia scholar's program"" which gives out funding grants for the summer and you get nice lectures, etc.  overall great program - but more of a yield tool to pull in great applicants. google it and you should find columbia's page that explains it. so congrats for getting it and getting in!

if you're deciding between columbia vs. harvard, both are good choices.  i would personally go to days on campus and harvard's equivalent (visitas?!) and see where you like more.  
 
choose for the experience/classes/oppurtunities - not the work-study requirement imo."
79,"i was a c.p. davis scholar. honestly it's not nearly as special as they make it out to be - in terms of perks, we are invited to a series of talks on a variety of subjects from space flight to physics to fashion, given by people inside and outside the university. besides that, we can apply for funding for projects over the summer, i.e. if you wanted to do research on campus you could get a housing and food stipend which will probably be a few thousand dollars. that's basically it. there might be one or two fancy dinners you're invited to, but there isn't any preferential treatment given to you in classes or anything. also the talks are only once a month so dont think of it like a club where people spend a lot of time together.

i'd pick harvard."
80,"thank you for your input! true.  harvard does have a world reputation like no other college.  

if i were to solely decide on the location, i’d pick columbia for sure. however, it would be shallow to turn down a place like harvard merely because of location. the truth is, i like boston and cambridge, but they’re no nyc. but regardless, i’m leaning more toward harvard right now. 

i’m going into stem, but i prefer more liberal schools. i thought harvard is quite liberal? what makes you say it’s conservative? "
81,i'll take harvard
82,"harvard will be considered conservative due to faculty it has and the “old money” legacy admits.

it’s not actually that conservative but definitely not as liberal as columbia.  but even columbia isn’t as activist as it likes to think of itself as imo."
83,what did you choose??? i'm was in the same position!! and chose the c.p davis at columbia over stanford and harvard.
84,"thank you. i’m undecided on what i might end up pursuing, and i think harvard will allow me more flexibility to explore all the things i’m interested in. 
"
85,"> sociologists, in general, recognize ""race"" as a social construct. this means that, though the concepts of race and racism are based in observable biological characteristics, any conclusions drawn about race on the basis of those observations are heavily influenced by cultural ideologies. racism, as an ideology, exists in a society at both the individual and the institutional level.

> while much of the research and work on racism in the last half-century or so has concentrated on ""white racism"" in the western world, historical accounts of race-based social practices can be found across the globe.[26] thus, racism can be broadly defined to encompass individual and group prejudices and acts of discrimination that result in material and cultural advantages conferred on a majority or dominant social group.[27] so-called ""white racism"" focuses on societies in which white populations are the majority or dominant social group. in studies of these majority white societies, the aggregate of material and cultural advantages is usually termed ""white privilege"".

> race and race relations are prominent areas of study in sociology and economics. much of the sociological literature focuses on white racism. some of the earliest sociological works on racism were penned by sociologist w. e. b. du bois, the first african american to earn a doctoral degree from harvard university. du bois wrote, ""the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.""[28] wellman (1993) defines racism as ""culturally sanctioned beliefs, which, regardless of intentions involved, defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities"".[29] in both sociology and economics, the outcomes of racist actions are often measured by the inequality in income, wealth, net worth, and access to other cultural resources, such as education, between racial groups.[30]

> in sociology and social psychology, racial identity and the acquisition of that identity, is often used as a variable in racism studies. racial ideologies and racial identity affect individuals' perception of race and discrimination. cazenave and maddern (1999) define racism as ""... a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. racial centrality (the extent to which a culture recognizes individuals' racial identity) appears to affect the degree of discrimination african american young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination.[31] sellers and shelton (2003) found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and social beliefs.[32]

> some sociologists also argue that, particularly in the west where racism is often negatively sanctioned in society, racism has changed from being a blatant to a more covert expression of racial prejudice. the ""newer"" (more hidden and less easily detectable) forms of racism—which can be considered as embedded in social processes and structures—are more difficult to explore as well as challenge. it has been suggested that, while in many countries overt or explicit racism has become increasingly taboo, even in those who display egalitarian explicit attitudes, an implicit or aversive racism is still maintained subconsciously.[33]

> this process has been studied extensively in social psychology as implicit associations and implicit attitudes, a component of implicit cognition. implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. these evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. they come about from various influences in the individual experience.[34] implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action toward social objects.[35] these thoughts, feelings or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware.[36]

> therefore, subconscious racism can influence our visual processing and how our minds work when we are subliminally exposed to faces of different colors. in thinking about crime, for example, social psychologist jennifer l. eberhardt (2004) of stanford university holds that, ""...blackness is so associated with crime you're ready to pick out these crime objects.""[37] such exposures influence our mind and can cause subconscious racism in our behavior towards other people or even objects. thus, racist thoughts and actions can arise from stereotypes and fears of which we are not aware.[38]"
86,"that is just straight up false. name one company in any field that heavily recruits from hyp that do not do so at columbia. i can tell you there is none. for banking and consulting if you are from wharton yes you may be able to compete with columbia but if you are from other schools at penn then columbia wins so easily. the influence columbia has in nyc far exceeds your imagination. 

as for top law firms, the law school at columbia is considered a whole tier higher than penn. there are firms that exclusively recruit from the top 6 schools but would not dig any deeper. columbia also just had the best law school employment outcome for 7 years in a row out of all law schools and last year the number 1 ranked law firm cravath recruited more candidates from columbia than any other law school despite schools like harvard and nyu having much larger class sizes. 

i am just not even going to comment on schools like cornell dartmouth and brown.

it's funny to see students from this school not realizing the power your own school wields in the center of the universe which is nyc where all these prestigious things you named converge."
87,"the reason why columbia isn't yet catching up on prestige with schools like hyp is precisely because of people like yourself who pretend to seem even handed or modest who go around and tell your friends columbia is worse than hyp and equivalent to penn and fucking cornell. columbia is the only ivy that has a complete repertoire of schools/programs/majors that serve the comprehensive functions of a university: the undergrad, law/med/business, humanities, social sciences, engineering, revolutionary industry oriented schools like sps the j-school. harvard is shit at engineering. yale is shit at everything that's not law. princeton doesn't have any professional law school which is essentially a college. penn's got wharton that overshadows its own brand. again im not going to comment on dartmouth brown and cornell. not a single ivy can exert influence in a similarly comprehensive fashion like columbia. the only school that can present an even match rests on the west coast. columbia is going to dominate the 21st century education, and the name recognition is always going to be lagging behind its powers precisely because of weaklings like you."
88,"i know a few from my year at two sig, not jane, and de shaw too from past years, do a linkedin search or sth, it'd help and tip for searching columbia grads is that you literally have to select a bunch of different schools as i know people would literally put cc or seas as a school instead of the generic ""columbia university in the city of new york"" lol 

i also know that for some firms, columbia is definitely a target. i know a few at hudson river from previous years (responsible for 5% of all stock trading in the us) and it had a drop down menu for only 11 schools:

carnegie mellon, cornell, harvard, mit, princeton, stanford, columbia, berkeley, texas-austin, uiuc, imperial college london, other, not a student

so yeah, columbia definitely has some representation in the industry, maybe not as much as other strong quant and stem schools, but nonetheless respectable."
