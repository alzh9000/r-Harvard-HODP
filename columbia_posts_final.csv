some students already started the petition to push columbia to revise our pass-fail grading policy. if you guys also agree, please sign! mit and smith have already made the change. harvard and other universities likely. let's get our voices heard by the administration.

update: cmu, cornell and georgetown to now allow p/f for students due to covid-19.

another update: we now have nearly 3,000 supporters for this petition. let's let the administration know! here is the link to an email template: https://www.change.org/p/columbia-university-pass-fail-grading-option-at-columbia-barnard/u/25957529"
1,"partnered with citadel llc and citadel securities, correlation one is hosting the world's most prestigious university level data science competition at schools such as oxford, mit, stanford, harvard, peking, and cmu.

after holding over 35 datathons in 5 countries, we are excited to announce that on **saturday, february 23rd** we will be hosting the **""east coast regional datathon,""** meaning it will be even bigger and more exciting than our university level competitions! 

many students have already signed up to compete, and we want to make sure **all** redditors from columbia have the chance to complete their applications before **the deadline on sunday, february 17th.**

datathons are a new type of live-action competition for data-driven, analytically minded students. they are analogous to ""hackathons"" for software engineers, but instead of building apps, contestants use real-world data to develop and substantiate solutions to a socially impactful problem. if you are curious to see what a datathon looks like, we encourage you to check out these videos from our past events:

**dublin datathon:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nqjcb8rhi&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nqjcb8rhi&)

**2017 datathon series finale held at the new york stock exchange:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpz-bbadwje&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpz-bbadwje&)

the east coast datathon is hosted by citadel llc & citadel securities in partnership with correlation one. the event will take place on saturday, february 23rd from 8:00am - 6:00pm at princeton. please note that **we will cover the cost of travel and overnight accommodation** for invited columbia students traveling to the event.

**highlights include:**

* **$25,000 in cash prizes!**
* **the chance to showcase your skills tackling a meaningful, real-world problem!**
* **the opportunity to represent your university against other top-tier schools in the data open championship at the new york stock exchange and win $100,000 in cash prizes!**
* **possible interviews with citadel & citadel securities!**

there are a limited number of spaces remaining, so we strongly suggest you to sign up as soon as possible **before the deadline on sunday, february 17th.** visit [https://www.citadel.com/careers/the-data-open/apply/](https://www.citadel.com/careers/the-data-open/apply/) and choose the east coast regional datathon to complete the questionnaire, assessment, and registration!

if you have any further questions, please direct them to [mert@correlation-one.com](mailto:mert@correlation-one.com). we look forward to receiving your application and hope to have you in attendance with us on saturday, february 23rd!"

3,"when i was a freshman, the bookstore used to sell polo hats with columbia university and the crown stitched on the side. had it for a long time but it got lost, does anyone know where i can buy another? they seem almost impossible to find. was very similar to the harvard example linked below. also linked below is the old bookstore listing for it, so i know i'm not going crazy. (i know it's kind of a scumbag article of clothing but i had some great memories with that hat)

4,"hi everyone! i was notified that i’d been admitted to the class of 2022 first via likely letter and then officially yesterday. when i opened the official decision on my portal, i saw another note congratulating me on being designated as one of the “prestigious” c. p. davis scholars. 

the first thing after seeing my official decision, i checked my financial aid offer and noticed that my entire financial aid money comes from the c. p. davis grant. due to this, i got nearly 6k$ more financial aid from columbia than from harvard (i got 0 contribution, 0 in loans from both, but no term-time work at columbia vs. 8-12 hours/week term-time work at harvard). that’s obviously fantastic, but i was also wondering if anyone has had any experience with this type of offer (being named a scholar in particular)? what are the other advantages and benefits of being named a scholar?  

and finally, should i choose columbia over harvard? can you elaborate on reasons why (other than the financial aid)? i’m seriously having a hard time deciding! 

thank you!!"
