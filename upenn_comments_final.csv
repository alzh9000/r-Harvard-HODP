fun fact: several of the cast members attended ivy league schools or other schools in that strata. mindy kaling (kelly) went to dartmouth, john krazinski (jim) went to brown, bj novak (ryan the temp) went to harvard, and ed helms (andy bernard) went to one of the most prestigious music schools, oberlin college."
1,"ok but even then tell me why other ivies are able to reduce tuition (princeton), provide more aid (harvard) or at the very least offer some free summer classes while penn increased its tuition by 5%?? (and i know this was planned due to “inflation” but considering the global situation maybe they can just go ahead and push that back a bit.)

the reason a lot of people bring up endowment is just to show how wealthy a school is vs. other. (ofc that’s not what the tweet is saying.) for example penn has an endowment that is 4 billion more than columbia’s but it can afford to give away some summer classes while penn’s still trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of its students. so unless penn has been terrible at investing its endowment i see no reason why it can’t afford to alleviate students’ financial burdens at this extraordinary time, especially considering what similar institutions are doing."
2,"princeton: 10% off tuition for everyone
harvard: extra 5k in aid to all students
mit: communism"
3,"and schools like columbia, mit, harvard, princeton didn’t do their budgets yet? they don’t have massive physical infrastructures that they need to run?

penn want to be seen on the same level as these schools so bad but it’s clear that they do not have the same commitment to their students."
4,"over the next two weeks, i bet we see many campuses rescinding the “hybrid model” and going fully online. a few campuses have already made that decision. if one other ivy or similarly positioned east coast school does, penn will feel pressured to follow suit. just like we did in march after harvard shut down."
5,"while the harvard plan seems absurd i'm confident about the fact that it's going to be a shit show once penn comes back in the fall. there seems to be a good chance that an outbreak might start up at penn. penn stated that they want to test people everyday but with juniors and seniors being forced to live off campus, it's not like penn can force them all to go to houston hall or whatever to get tested when everything is basically online. people are going to spread the disease like wildfire and it seems like there's a good chance they penn will have to amend their ""compact"" to take a more conservative approach on combatting the virus or maybe even have to send people home again."
6,deferral from penn is not like a deferral from harvard/yale. harvard/yale defers almost 70% of apps. on the other hand i believe penn only defers \~20% of apps. i know the acceptance rate of people who got deferred is between 18-20%. write a letter of continued interest to the admissions officer!
7,"agreed — i thought it was terrible pr when harvard med/law/gov announced online-only months ago, and now they’re looking great compared to the drag-it-out shirtshow"
8,"did my undergrad at umich, now here for grad school, 100% agree. plus, imo, it looks too similar to harvard’s mascot lol."
9,"i do know that the endowment money can't just be doled out to students and that there are some expenses that the university needs to take care of. however, i just find it very hard to believe they wouldn't be able to at least offer free summer credits (like harvard) or provide students with extra on-campus jobs (like mit). the others were able to do this - why can't we? besides, part of our tuition goes to on-campus services like extracurricular activities, talks by guest lecturers, etc. can't the money that was saved from the cancellation of these services go toward students?"
10,"you do realize that a good chunk of penn's endowment is unrestrictied. i'm not too sure of penn's distribution but when looking at harvard, 70% of their endowment is restricted while 30% is unrestricted. out of that 30% a good chunk of it is liquid. given that penn's endowment is 15b, \~4.5b of it is unrestricted. while obviously penn wouldn't contribute a large chunk of their endowment to paying off people's tuition for invesmtent reasons and common sense (them having to provide other relief due to covid), let's assume that only 5% of this is liquid. that's nearly 200m that could easily go towards lowering tuition for over 20k students. even a decrease of $5k per student is 125m assuming \~25k students which would go a long way for those that are getting shafted out of their college experience."
11,"\> it would just cause grade inflation for a semester.

idk if i get the tone here, but it seems to imply grade inflation is a bad thing. i hardly think that one semester of a/fail would earn penn a moniker of  ""harvard 2.0"" and even if it does...what's the consequence? grade inflation is just a term that carries no real repercussions (though we've been trained to think it does). 

but breaking down the situation here:

imagine you're a premed. a non-trivial amount of medical schools say they will prefer to get letter grades instead of p/f grades. so p/f'ing a course is functionally not an option for many students on penn's campus. 

so now the options are mandatory p/f or just keep normal procedures in place (basically what penn's doing right now minus being able to use p/f for fulfilling reqs).

in the mandatory p/f world, people who wanted to use this semester to increase their grade get screwed over.

in the ""keep calm and carry on"" world of just not altering policies, anyone who experiences changes in circumstances due to covid is also screwed over.

a/fail or triple-a is effectively the best of both worlds. people who want to distinguish themselves still have an a+ to strive for. people who are affected by covid likely won't suffer a ding on their transcript. yeah, some students may get a higher grade than they were supposed to but...eh? anyone who cares to look can see an a- would mean the person was in the bottom third of the class and can accordingly make adjustments if they care to do so. 

will i think it'll get implemented? probably not...just bc some faculty would prefer the vast majority of students get a c and ugrad is too inflated as is (so they'd endorse anything that goes against inflation in general)."
12,"> med schools generally prefer you take the pre-requisites for a letter grade. if they saw you took a class p/f this semester, but you're able to explain a valid reason as to why your circumstances required doing so, then i'm sure there is some leeway.

some med schools do think its fine, some don't (@harvard). premed advisors have shifted towards encouraging students to take courses for a grade no matter what.

and also i clarified my ""c"" point. i didn't mean that the vast majority of students would get a c, i just meant that some professors think that we are already too grade inflated (and would prefer a ""c"" to be the mean grade rather than a bish) and wouldn't vote for anything that hints at more inflation."

>the office of the committee on admissions at harvard medical school recognizes that plans to complete pre-requisite coursework have been impacted immensely by schools’ decisions to move to an online instruction model given the current realities of the covid-19 pandemic.  while hms has always assessed pre-requisites based on the grades given by colleges/universities, we understand that many colleges/universities are emergently creating policies in which all spring 2020 courses will be graded on a pass/fail scale.  so that no applicants are disadvantaged by policy decisions made by their colleges/universities as a result of this unprecedented event, hms will accept pass/fail grading for spring 2020 coursework provided it is the policy of the college/university to only award pass/fail grades."
15,mit is also pulling a harvard: [http://web.mit.edu/covid19/update-from-president-l-rafael-reif-to-the-mit-community/?fbclid=iwar0\_yirzwzti9\_f33-t4fecsemysmfyw-w9dd\_qwhwxg8zu68pdgklkouxi](http://web.mit.edu/covid19/update-from-president-l-rafael-reif-to-the-mit-community/?fbclid=iwar0_yirzwzti9_f33-t4fecsemysmfyw-w9dd_qwhwxg8zu68pdgklkouxi)
16,"really hoping penn doesn't do what harvard just did and send everybody home for the semester. makes sense to hold classes online, but kicking students out of dorms seems irresponsible and rash."
17,"it's also easier for schools like harvard, mit, and cornell to do when their spring break is still upcoming. schools who are currently on a break or ended already aren't shutting down the campus entirely and sending people home it seems."
18,"it's a joke. chill!!

i applied here ed. it's not cuz i'm a harvard wait-list student."
19,"pros:

\-if you want to do research, you will be able to. curf is an amazing center that ensures that any undergrad who wants to be involved in research can learn how to get involved.

\-if you want to serve your community in a diverse city with diverse issues, this is the place to be.

\- as a whole, penn has great professors, and if you need help in a class, you'll be able to access that help, whether its through office hours or free tutoring services.

\-lots of pre-meds. could be a pro or con for you, but you definitely will not feel alone.

\-work life balance. at the end of the day, the majority of penn students have passions outside of school. you'll find pre-med students performing music, rushing sororities and playing sports. also: you'll see pre-meds in all kinds of majors here, even fine arts. 

\- great pre-health advisors

cons:

\-grade deflation in many pre-med classes. this is inescapable for a prestigious institution imo, unless you got into harvard, yale, or brown. you will undoubtably have one test that will serve as a moment of reckoning for you as to whether this path is right for you.

\-a competitive environment. could be a pro or con for you, for me it was a pro because i needed that to push me in the right direction. however, i avoided having pre-med friends because it was just too stressful for me.

\-fomo. penn plays hard, and as a pre-med, you will have to make tough choices about whether to go out and have a good time or hunker down and study while the ""rest of the world"" isn't.

penn fills \~1/6-1/7 of its med school class with penn students. it has about as much preference for its own students as any other institution, except the few that show strong preference, like brown."
20,"seas definitely isn't a walk in the park, but you can do well if you put in the time. it also can't hurt to use the resources that penn gives you (office hours, meetings with profs, tutoring if needed, etc). penn hasn't released official school-specific gpa averages in a while, but the most recent one was from 2001 and engineering was the lowest of the four with an average gpa of 3.28.

i also would stress that it's a different type of learning than humanities courses and it's difficult to compare them - straight problem sets vs. essays and readings, from experience both offer their own challenges if you take them seriously.

i think a 3.8 is definitely attainable, but it depends on how much you're willing to put in and how well you do in time-pressured exam environments. i think the time pressure aspect is something that people have to adjust to coming in, but it's something you can also get better at as you take more classes.

if you choose your courses carefully and don't take a ton of hard ones in a single semester, you should be fine. to the point of grade deflation, from my experience no curves at penn engineering are designed to give you a worse grade than your raw score. that being said, penn is definitely not a place that has the type of [grade inflation at harvard.](https://www.quora.com/what-was-it-like-to-attend-harvard-when-it-had-grade-inflation)"
21,get into harvard.
22,"i actually think it’s great that people always confuse upenn with penn state. it really serves to keep our egos in check (especially the wharton kids), which is one of the reasons i chose upenn, rather than another ivy. i mean, just look at how conceited and arrogant most harvard students are comparatively."
23,"well if it makes everyone else feel better all my friends and family are from mexico. they have never even heard the term ivy league before, and have never heard of any of the schools other than harvard. 

literally no one, not even my parents, got why i was so excited i got into upenn."
24,"penn sounds nicer than upenn but generally makes people think psu outside of pa (and probably sometimes within pa). i don't really see that changing since psu is known for sports more widely than penn is known for \~prestige\~ or whatever. at this point it's probably some twisted point of pride to refuse to cave and use the slightly more awkward name.

carey/penn law is because it was supposed to be just carey law and all the students panicked at the loss of name recognition so they compromised with penn carey law. (which is kind of understandable - imagine if they tried to rename harvard law)

idk, is it the school with issues keeping names consistent or is it us? for instance the student body collectively decided that ""lauder"" sounded stupid and now 2 years of incoming freshman have been taught to keep calling it nch."
25,“harvard waitlist”
26,it looks like you want to also attend harvard from your reddit thread.  i guess they are stupid too.

27,"penn is not the first, a lot of ivy schools are pausing their ph.d apps on...say... humanities and education. i'm honestly surprised that gse hasn't put a hold on app so far (harvard/stanford/princeton are) so we will see if sas is the only ""unlucky"" school that is going down"
28,harvard is also doing something similar (or at least trying to at the last minute).
29,"without a doubt colleges will not open(if they are smart). 

&#x200b;

1)those that do will have precautions set up that makes college more like a solitary confinement prison simulator. im guessing the freshmen at harvard will be begging to go home after a few weeks. 

2) there is a 99% chance there will be a major outbreak at the college or the immediate area that requires the college to send home kids which is a way bigger logistical nightmare. 

3) grade schools across the country are struggling to open and its very much in question for them. it is way more important for developing children to attend school for social and mental development. it wont be good look that any local college prioritized their kids partying over local children in terms of local risk tolerance. 

&#x200b;

i would not get a lease or sign any local commitments until the day classes start. even then i would look for a month to month lease."
30,"nope. deferred ea harvard, waitlist harvard up until july. i'm literally what tucker carlson referred to."

33,"would dorms be closed (like harvard) because theres no point cancelling classes if freshmen are still going to be all cramped in the freshman housing sharing bathrooms and eating in dining halls

36,"womp, just checked and neither of my applicants were admitted.  i know it's insanely difficult, even more so as a regular decision applicant.

my best friend throughout my k-12 schooling was our valedictorian, won the merck science exam competition among thousands of students in nj, scored the highest cumulative organic chemistry score out of 1800+ students while as a first-year student, ended up as only 1 of 8 rutgers 2009 graduates with a 4.0, did his phd at princeton, and just finished his post-doc at mit.

and he was waitlisted at harvard (and eventually rejected), though he was accepted at columbia.

so yeah, it's insane.  i was playing xbox in high school, these kids are forming organizations and all that.  so glad i went the grad school route haha."
37,"this is sort of funny ... know brown kids ... they don't take a lot of p/f cause they know it won't be viewed so well to employers and grad schools... penn generally has a more interdisciplinary mindset in general than many other schools .... and that is the focus of ben f. scholars (who come from all four schools, not just cas). the competitive atmosphere is prevalent at penn for sure (and job seeking is a good thing by the way -- this is not just a recreational think tank endeavor) but it is also your mindset.  i had a roommate at penn that never talked about grades and read a newspaper before every exam and just would not get sucked into it... and i know others that calculate their gpa after every homework assignment and try (usually unsuccessfully) to game the system. but there are plenty of people who seek collaboration and just want to learn and know if they study hard they will do just fine -- these are the chillest and the coolest and maybe it is you?  i think also that in some disciplines like comp. sci., your grades while important are not as important as what can you do, what have you coded, where are your capabilities.  for pre-med and pre-law you have a bit more pressure (not only at penn but at all schools) to do well not only in your gpa but on the mcat or lsat so you have that pressure.  and, every ivy other than yale, harvard and princeton, has that element of ""we try harder""... but at some point, it kicks in...  just learn, be diligent and you will do fine... penn's statistics on future outcomes is super impressive. one thing that i hope penn will remedy is that the one university policy allows all students to take classes at all other schools/colleges but you can't really major in a wharton discipline without applying to and getting accepted there... though you can take courses (and you can major in economics in cas etc...and computer science in both seas and cas (i think).  but most people don't care since if the wanted that they may have applied for a joint degree or applied to w from the beginning."
38,"don't know what they are waiting for, i do know for a fact the university is thinking about it. several departments at harvard have also started allowing pass/fail to count for students' degrees."
39,"had a varsity soccer playoff game the same day as decisions came out. knew i was getting penn and harvard decisions the same day. figured i would look at harvard before the game (was not optimistic at all) but would wait until after the game to look at penn. i really wanted to get into penn but knew i had to focus on the game and didn't want to bomb the game if i knew i didn't get into penn. 

found out i didn't get into harvard, went ""oh well"", and drove to the game. as i was in my parked car just outside of the bus, said ""fuck it"" and looked up the decision on my phone (which took forever as smart phone technology wasn't great in 2009). super happy i got in, but immediately reset my mind for the game.

we eventually lost 1-0. very sad, and it was my last high school soccer game. went to the stands with watery eyes where my mom was, and she said ""i'm so sorry."" getting a smile on my face as i told her that i got into penn is a memory i won't soon forget. one thing ended as another began. "
40,study abroad/language immersion or any random job. also totally fine to just do nothing. there are also a lot of places offering free online classes (i know harvard has a few) and you can always take one of those to learn something that interests you.
41,"> there are opportunities closed to me because of the need for ""diversity"", because too many white men have gotten them in the past.

what is your opinion of the lawsuit currently suing harvard and princeton for discriminating against asian american students? some estimates state that w/o affirmative action, 60-70% of many top private schools would be asian american.

would you still support doing away with affirmative action if it meant more than half of top colleges in the us being filled with asians?

this is a serious question, because (as an asian) i still wouldn't get rid of aa. but your comments seem to suggest you'd rather get rid of aa.

>those selected on account of the need for diversity stick out like a sore thumb

do they really? i don't really notice them, but i could just be a super unobservant undergrad lol.


edit: and yeah, penn is obnoxiously liberal at times; [this article is super accurate imo](http://www.thedp.com/article/2016/10/luke-tortora-where-tolerance-goes-to-die)."
42,"bigger picture: five hundred students of every race, gender, height, income level, religion, and age take classes in a department taught by 20 white, harvard-educated, jewish males. this sends the message that success is unattainable to most of the 500 students because the authority figures are not like them. (unless, of course, you also only admit an equally homogeneous student body.)

it sucks having underqualified students, faculty, and guest speakers. i'd rather have a few people come from underprivileged backgrounds, get educated, and spread the message back home that virtually anybody can make their life better through hard work and a thirst for knowledge."
43," i wonder if penn will not be accepting applications or cut down the cohort size of unpopular programs in 2021. [harvard](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/doctorate) and [princeton](https://sociology.princeton.edu/graduate-program) are not accepting new members for their ph.d. in education/sociology, and many other schools (duke, ucsb, vandy) have already been joining them. i knew there would be some red numbers because of the pandemic, but i just never thought that schools would actually close their doors and shoo the applicants away because of their lack of funding. it's crazy how this pandemic has affected academics—virtual classes, lifestyle, and ultimately closing down ""unpopular"" programs to ""conserve"" resources"
44,"also want to cast my vote for universal p/f. it's unfair to put the burden of choosing pass/fail on the students who are actually affected by the displacement, while giving the benefits of choosing the good grades that appear on your transcript (hence, altering your gpa) to those who aren't. students who still do well in a universal pass/fail setting and want it to show it to professional schools can do so by explaining in their application, having their professors tell those schools what their grade would have been, showing it through their letters of recommendation, etc. doing well in any semester takes effort, and this semester is no exception to that rule.

wanting to raise a gpa for academic honors like latin honors at graduation, phi beta kappa, etc are selfish and readily dismissible as reasons to keep p/f (yet i've seen it a surprising amount!).

the fact that harvard med school put out a statement saying they won't take opt-in p/f requirements is irrelevant as far as i see it. they're the only school that i've seen put out something that says this, and i know people that have contacted many more med/grad schools that have all said they understand the circumstances and won't look down on it. so i do think this argument for universal p/f is very weak, and i'm surprised that the pro opt-in people haven't picked up on this more.

double/triple a is entirely unreasonable. no respectable university will implement this policy, since it makes grades totally meaningless. arguing for double/triple a just detracts from the legitimate and experimentally-substantiated case for universal p/f, since at this point even multiple schools in the ivy league are using it. 

i'm stunned by the amount of people who are arguing that they were using this semester to raise their gpas, so they want opt-in p/f. the fact that the college sent out an email that multiple fgli students told them this and dismissed the massive burden placed on students that are affected by this is absurd. there is functionally no equality in the learning environments and resources that students have, and it's making college (largely) pay-to-win. as far as i see it, the college is entirely bending over to people who want to raise their gpas and not addressing the present issue."
45,"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kfxiwvahef3luyoyrhgzqtcetqs0fan4cyn94_r6lt0/htmlview

list of med schools and stance on p:f. it’s more than harvard unfortunately. a lot are saying “prefer” graded which is basically saying they want graded without getting as much bad press as harvard."
46,"many graduate programs (e.g., harvard med) have come out saying that the only way they will accept p/f is if it is universal at your university. so i feel like this would be better for most than opt-in as it would reduce the stress on people who are disadvantaged in this situation and also pursuing graduate studies."
47,"thank you! finally. this is the first time that i've actually seen a single school besides harvard that says they don't want p/f.

i totally agree with you, medical schools that ""prefer"" grades over p/f are pushing students to take courses graded. that's an astounding lack of support for the health of students coming from *medical schools*."
48,"i think there's a pretty strong stigma against taking pass/fail, especially with things like that harvard med school policy going around. i'm not saying it's a reasonable stigma, but the fact that it exists is pretty undeniable, especially in the premed/related sciences community (which i am also part of). the students that are actually affected by this situation are the ones who have to deal with the stigma that's associated. 

another argument that i've seen that is sadly becoming more relevant is that people might not be affected now, but they will be later. this is as much an argument for opt-in p/f with a later deadline as it is for universal p/f due to the distribution swings that some classes might see and the lack of predictability in the grades that people might get."
49,"depends the quality of friends you want to make. i was a fgli student, most of my friends were actually fgli students too. i am latino, i hung out mostly with latino/black students (many of whom were also fgli) and students from my penncap summer program. met a few affluent students but their pride in being affluent was a real turn off for me so i never bothered to try and get to know them. but some of my fgli friends did end up becoming friends with some affluent students so it's not impossible obviously. 

if they show a disdain for you because of your socioeconomic status, they're not worth getting to know. obviously as an fgli student, you will be limited in what you can do on breaks but honestly, that limitation never bothered me. i enjoyed my time on campus, didn't necessarily feel like i had to have money on the scale of the rich kids. i proudly mentioned that i was an fgli and didn't have to ""go to a high school whose tuition was as much as harvard's"" (quoting a rich girl who was very nice but felt the need to mention that in our first conversation in a chemistry class) and still make it to penn. anyone that scoffs at someone who comes from a humble background can fuck off lol you'll be fine. penn will take care of you and you won't be inhibited unless you allow yourself to be."

both the first and third options aren't going to be able to be replicated at penn. the first could probably but it seems like penn has already demonstrated some effort to try to get people to be on campus and take classes remotely. the third definitely wont happen and just sounds absolutely absurd. i know penn sent out their penn pay plan  subscription a few days ago as tuition will be due soon. seems like theyll try to lock in payment plans and then announce the housing situation afterwards and then refund people like last semester"
52,"yup, some people seem think the hyp tier of ivy league is pretty set in stone and that those three will always be considered the ""top tier"" of ivys (of course this mainly means prestige/name recognition). however, i think schools like stanford and mit have shown that it is possible to break into this tier, hence why people also say hypsm. also, fun fact is that penn was the 3rd earliest ivy league school that was founded (after harvard and yale). it is time to reclaim the p!"
53,"it's t13 now, because ut austin and georgetown take a cliff dive in employment numbers, as well as they fail to meet the definition of t14 (i.e., they fail to have never fallen out of the t14).

i'm not sure what you mean by ""safe."" depends what you think is safe. that's entirely subjective. for me, someone is safe for the t13 if they have over a 169, have over a 3.3, and submit an application that has had any typos or awkward sentences polished out.

just because the median gpa for an incoming class is 3.8+ and lsat 170+ does not mean that a ""typical matriculant has a 3.8+ and 170+."" that's not how statistics works. the aggregate cannot be applied to the singular. further, medians are not ""averages."" that means we do not know what the typical applicant looks like.

if you submit a polished application and have a 3.8 and 170, you'll be expecting either a t6, or a t13 with scholarship, roughly speaking.

most of these law schools admit like 20% of applicants, including harvard. don't underestimate that statistic. this is nothing like getting into an ivy league undergrad (single digit percentage acceptance rates), with the exception of comparing yale law (10%) or stanford law (12%) to darmouth undergrad (9%)."
54,"i would say its a rare (and lucky) university student these days who does not struggle significantly during their four years. i have friends at harvard, at cornell, at georgetown, at ut austin, rice etc who all concur. 

all of them often feel overwhelmed and sunk - classes like chem, calc, thermo, they are all super tough and can be really hard. whether its feeling stupid compared to your peers, a lack of meaning in your coursework or social alienation, this anxiety/depression/struggle is remarkably common. 

whats important to remember is 
a) people don't say this to high school seniors cause college is portrayed as this hollywood perfect place 
b) just because some weeks may feel really tough, doesn't mean the entire experience can be super rewarding and awesome. midterms are horrible. getting good grades, laughing with friends, putting on a show is the best. 

if we look at op, i am sure she will tell you that some weeks are horrible, and some are pretty awesome. but that will be the same across similar universities, and across almost all majors. whartonites hate status updates. take home essays mean three consequitive all nighters. orgo is the worst etc. "
55,"so...it depends what you mean by government and what you mean by assistance.

pa state govt' actively funds the upenn vet school, philadelphia:[https://www.thedp.com/article/2017/10/penn-vet-will-receive-30-million-in-state-funding-after-all](https://www.thedp.com/article/2017/10/penn-vet-will-receive-30-million-in-state-funding-after-all)

i also imagine that penn get's a fair amount of kickbacks from the philadelphia city govt' because it is a major jobs provider in the area. but this is primarily done through policy that applies to everyone (but could have been originally made to benefit penn/other large philly universities in some way).

on a federal ish type level, penn receives a ton of funding via nih (and similar fed research orgs) grants and that basically alleviates a lot of the research expenditures since a fair portion of labs are self-sustaining based on the amount of grant money they bring in from federal (and external) organizations. pell grants and federal work study programs are also provided to penn by the govt. penn also spends a fair amount of $$ on lobbying for various political causes, so they are probably getting some degree of kickbacks as well through other policies. also...by being recognized as a 501c3 nonprofit, they are exempt from federal taxes (which basically saves penn on the order of billions a year).

if you're asking something along the lines of what happened this year with the $9.9m cares act fund, i'd honestly consider it along the lines of a grant similar to the nih/pell grant type stuff above (ie its federal). i don't think penn actively requested that money ([well...at least harvard said they didn't request it](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/harvard-trump-coronavirus.html)) and was instead just allocated to us based on the provisions from the cares act itself (i think like $14b was allocated to all higher ed institutions and was split based on amount of fed financial aid awarded to students in the institution). of course, we returned it [due to some backlash](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/cornavirus-aid-relief-cares-funding-penn-ivy-league) (but damn $9.9m would have been nice just to distribute to all students).

but the bottom line is that penn receives a significant amount of aid from the governments (city, state, federal) it interacts with."
56,"i’ve never heard of that personally, but that doesn’t mean it’s not possible. i applied to harvard in addition to penn when i was in high school. my penn interview was in person but my harvard interview was actually on campus with an admissions officer, a 4+ hour drive away. 

all that said, the people who conduct these penn interviews are volunteers. if something comes up, they don’t have a boss to report to or any reason not to change/postpone/use whatever medium they want "
57,"to add to this, penn tends to be pretty middle-of-the-road when it comes to overall gpas. if i recall correctly, the median gpa of humanities majors is around 3.5 (between a- and b+), while the median for science and engineering majors is around 3.2 (between b and b+). these are pretty fair, and it's very much reasonable to get and maintain a good gpa. unfortunately, we don't inflate quite as much as schools like harvard!"
58,"i took a gap year even without the pandemic. best choice i made. i think you should consider it because 4 years of penn should be the best 4 years ever and if you feel you wouldn’t get that staying at home, there is a strong reason for you to postpone and come back for your freshman experience in 2021. also know that many more of your peer ‘24s are taking gaps now that we can’t come back to campus. you’re not alone in making this decision. also note that at harvard, 20% of all students are taking the year off."
