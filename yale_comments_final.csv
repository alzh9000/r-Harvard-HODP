0,"the evidence that was brought against harvard last year was about as blatant as racial affirmative action can get and it was *still* found to be legal by the ninth circuit. the letter is just harassment by the doj and is meaningless. unless they start an actual enforcement action by january, which i doubt they will, they are just culture-warring and blowing smoke for the elections."
1,"most legacies would have gotten in without legacy admissions. the harvard study showed that removing legacy doesn't change the racial composition of the class by even 1%

legacy was designed for the unqualified rich kids. their aren't that many of them around"
2,"i believe i saw a post somewhere on a2c that harvard’s case study revealed that adjusting legacy applicants’ stats, legacy itself did not give a lot of advantage—without donations, though. donation counts a lot."
3,"if they had high gpas, standardized test scores, and ended up doing well that will overshadow it. i went to harvard and by accident, knew or roomed with at least five double legacies -- both parents had gone to harvard/radcliffe. they were all very bright, talented people who would have gotten in without the legacy advantage."
4,"you clearly know nothing about elite college admission. harvard, princeton and yale all turn down far more applicants with perfect gpas and sats than they accept."
5,see the records released from the harvard trial.
6,"thanks; you get it. my parody comic (i run a new york times-only parody site) focuses on how the new york times pushes the trope of students being accepted to all ivies, but *only* for african-american students. for example:

* [the ivy league sweep: still rare, but you’re more likely to hear about it](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/us/ivy-league-school-acceptance.html) - archive: http://archive.is/jhzcx

the article's ""author"" is milton winternitz, a yale dean known for limiting admissions to yale based on what became known as a [jewish quota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_quota). the races have changed (ironically, the nyt's jewish executive editor was also replaced by an african-american prior to the publishing of the above articles), but the philosophy - establishing admissions quotas based on identity, rather than merit - is the same.

to be fair, both yale and harvard (and many others) are under fire for this practice right now. look at thomas j. espenshade's work for more on this."
7,lol how is it racist? he’s speaking facts. honestly at this point i might even try for yale and harvard. was planning to go to the university of toronto but seeing this i might actually have a chance.

9,"in the first link i sent. you can see that that the last model removes race/athlete/legacy. it keeps the rest of harvard's existing ratings


here's another model : 

http://samv91khoyt2i553a2t1s05i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/doc-421-145-admissions-part-ii-report.pdf

page 11 model 3. although remember that harvard heavily spiked ""personal"" ratings in favor of underrepresented minorities(and against asians) which meant it effectively served as another lever of affirmative action. harvard didn't contest this in court."
10,"harvard fought tooth and nail to prevent the release of the data set. we only have models and data snaps from harvard. 

princeton and stanford burn their admissions files for a reason. there's nothing there that isn't proof of discrimination(we knew this since 1989, we just pretend that we didn't) 


you can see in the last link that harvard released comparisons between whites and asians. asians won in every category(including extracurriculars) except personal ratings, which in of itself a second lever of affirmative action. 


if asians are destroying whites in every category, i assume that they defeat urm's in extracurricular/essay/recommendations etc."
11,"it certainly looks like some harvard students might be trying to mock the statement for the upcoming harvard yale game between the rival schools:

https://notanintellectual.space/#shirts"
12,yeah until halftime harvard was leading but after that and the protest stuff bulldogs changed the game. it was really awesome.
13,"it would be interesting to replace 'fascist' here with 'puritanical.' we are often reminded that when english puritans came to the massachusetts colony (and eventually founded harvard), they came for the purpose of religious freedom, but what's usually left out of that narrative is the fact that their legal definition of religious freedom extended only to other puritans. it did not grant freedom to quakers or atheists. dissent was punishable by banishment because dissenters were seen as a fundamental threat to the social order, an evil that could not be tolerated. 

our 18th century first amendment was a revolutionary change, pun intended, but now, it seems that student protesters want to take us back to the 17th where certain utterances (should i invoke witchcraft, apropos of puritans and halloween?) have the power to cause harm at a distance. 

i've been paying attention to this trend, and i think there is a distinction between people working pragmatically on social justice issues and those for whom these issues have become a campaign for moral purity, a campaign that, among other objectives, purports to ferret out secret heresies in the words of the others. 

"
14,"this is how you know this sub has been brigaded by non-yalies... some shit from harvard is getting upvoted.

hey harvard - only we get to call yalies fascists!"
15,"this is just untrue. harvard med and others have already said as long as it’s universal, p is fine."
16,"this is a valid experience and that sucks. it is not the experience i had at yale, though it definitely reminds me of what hanging out with harvard and penn kids was like (especially wharton kids). i would suggest hanging out with different people. seriously - it will change your yale experience"
17,"i had friends at princeton, harvard, columbia, dartmouth, and brown, and based on that unscientific sampling i would say:

1. yalies had a great balance between working hard and making time for friends and hobbies. people (my friends at least) were not competitive with others, but rather with themselves and with the big questions in their subject areas. 
2. yalies love the exchange of ideas. i learned probably as much in late night talks over main garden chinese food and stromboli from aladdin crown pizza as i did in classes. i had a friend who was working on an aids vaccine, one who taught me enough music theory that i aced my theory classes as a humanities major, etc.
3. yalies are funny, nerdy, and self-deprecating.
4. the music scene is huge.
5. new haven has incredible food.
6. the social scene is not alcohol-dependent. parties happen *after* your friends' shows or games or service events. drinking feels much more optional when you have that built-in conversation and shared interests. there's plenty of partying, but it's not the same as when people start a keg right after their last class on on a friday and the party itself is the main focus of the night.

i'm sure these things are true to some degree or another at the other ivies, but yale just seemed loaded with these amazing nerds every five feet who were hilarious, deeply expert in at least a couple things each, and able to talk about other things than their grades. i got the impression from friends at some of the other ivies that they had to work harder to find those social groups and that there were more hypercompetitive people or fewer things to do other than drink."
18,"most people seemed happy. i certainly was. comparatively speaking, my impression is that yale is a happier place than most of its peer institutions.

as an undergrad visiting harvard, princeton, and columbia––and now as an alum with many friends who went to those schools––i was always struck by how much less happy they seemed on average. my impression is that brown students are about as happy as yalies, if not slightly happier. 

one of the best things about yale is that social life is decentralized. people make friends in clubs, classes, residential colleges, greek life, athletics, art programs, research labs, and so on...it's not like dartmouth, where most of the ""cool"" people are all in the top frats and sororities, or princeton, where you have to get into an eating club sophomore year in order to have ""mainstream"" social life. sure, yale has societies, but many of the most popular and well-known people on campus aren't in them, and they're generally not a big deal.

of course, this is a biased, anecdotal opinion and should be taken with several grains of salt. "
19,"the simpsons writing crew is primarily staffed by harvard alumni, so no one's really surprised. 

is it an accurate portrayal of yale or universities in general? of course not. there are a few people like that in every college, but the media doesn't focus on the vast majority of people who lead perfectly normal lives, pursue interesting extracurricular and academic activities, or even engage in normal, sensible activism. it just doesn't make for good tv.

 "
20,"""rumors are trickling down at both yale & harvard that they might delay the start of next semester, basically offsetting ay2020-21 so that the fall semester would take place in sp21 and the spring semester in su21. i've heard that this is a 50/50 possibility...

21,now we just need to beat harvard :s (one year left for me this year was so close...)
22,"school-wide school spirit is definitely a downside, imo. however, the harvard-yale football game is crazy fun and there are football tailgates you can go to (they’re not as well-attended as a state school though). res colleges dominate in terms of yale spirit; you identify more with your residential college than yale itself.

yale is making strides to change this by opening the schwarzmann center and giving all students a better and more open place to study and collaborate in the hopes of fostering a more cohesive school spirit, though!"
23,"i’m a phd student who went elsewhere for undergrad.

yale is fantastic for physics and astronomy. the classes will take you on a wonderful adventure through the cosmos and you will have a great time. in terms of optimizing employability and exciting coursework, physics is the best option.

want to go to grad school? go here and you will get to work with professors at the top of their field. after you get settled in (not your first semester), you will have dozens of research projects to choose from where you can expand mankind’s understanding of subatomic particles, dark matter, and the evolution of galaxies. your recommendation letters will be highly effective - the extra factor that gets you into your top choice, assuming you do well in courses and work hard to make new discoveries in research. 

want to get a high paying job? physicists are mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers, and data analysts wrapped into one. while this breadth is slightly challenging when competing with pure ee/me/cs majors, you shouldn’t have any trouble finding a good job. plus, it is excellent for fields like data science or consulting, and coming from yale you can even find your way into finance/banking. moreover, if you do decide to get a ms or phd in another subject, a physics degree from yale can easily get you into graduate school in any discipline (chemistry, math, engineering, computer science, business - you name it), whereas the reverse is not true (it is exceptionally hard to get into a physics/astronomy phd without a prior degree in the field). all this opportunity *and* your classes were way more fun than your ee/me/cs peers.

i have seen the weird opinion online that yale is weak in stem. that is simply absurd. while it may be ranked slightly below its traditional peers like harvard, princeton, mit, and stanford, it is usually listed in the top 10 out of >750 us colleges that award physics bachelor degrees. you would be very lucky to go here. that said, if you don’t get in that’s fine too. i got in for a phd after all, and you likely haven’t heard of my undergrad. but i had to get a near perfect gpa and work as a researcher for a year after my bs to be considered equal to my peers who went to fancy schools. so definitely go now if you can. plus the residential colleges are cute - yale easily beats any other school if the vibe is at your resonant frequency."
24,"some people (myself included) definitely get really into res college culture and spirit, especially in ims. overall though the tradition and culture of the school leads to a lot of spirit. a suite staple is a big ""for god, for country, and for yale"" sign. and like someone else said, during harvard yale your university becomes your entire identity for a weekend and it's so much fun"
25,both of john harvard’s feet and it’s a deal.
26,"thank you mr 2 hour old profile for your inciteful comments. i too am a ""democrat"" and feel the need to comment on this school forum i am totally a student at.

edit: also, harvard for the downvote arrow? i obviously ""love"" that because i go to ""yale"" and have no affiliation with harvard."
27,"feel free to redirect ""is yale a good college?"" traffic over to /r/harvard. we'd be happy to field those questions for you. :)"
28,"hate:
i had a really hard time adjusting to yale. everything is very segregated and as a mixed kid, it was hard to feel accepted into any singular group, imo. 

in my opinion, i also think it’s hard to socialize unless you join extracurriculars. i haven’t had any experiences getting close with people in my classes unless i’d known them previously (as acquaintances or even through my ecs). i guess you can party and socialize that way too, but it wasn’t my thing.

you can’t live with people from different years or outside of your res college unless you move off-campus with them. this is frustrating for me because most of my friends are first-years in another college, so i have no choice but to find other people to live with.

love:
i think yale is a collaborative environment. there are pockets of competition, but overall i think the environment is much better than harvard, mit, or uchicago.

yale has so many opportunities and different groups of people to become friends with. you could literally reinvent yourself on campus if you liked, although it might take some time to make that adjustment.

most of the professors i have had genuinely care about their students and work. i have loved learning from them.

there is a strong idea of mentorship at yale. i think many students are able to find a mentor while here. i have done so through my lab and it has been a wonderful experience.

lab and research opportunities are endless. if you reach out, you will find a position somewhere, even if it may not be your first choice."
29,"you should probably take a year off, although you also need to really think about what you'll do instead. if you can do some volunteer work, online internship, some low-key travel (go camping or go for a bike tour!), or if you think you can do some decent self-education while at home (there are several yale/harvard/mit classes that you can take for free online, like cs50), that's probably worth it. 

i wish all of us in higher-ed could take the whole year off."
30,harvard cancelled their admitted student days. i believe mit cancelled all events until may. cornell cancelled all events greater than 100 until mid-april. i doubt bulldog days will happen.
31,"they were calling for yale, as well as harvard, to end their holdings in puerto rico’s debt and also divest all endowments from the fossil fuel industry. whoever’s upset about a football game being interrupted over something as serious as climate change needs to do some serious self-evaluating."
32,"why don't students just choose a different / more climate sensitive school instead of patronizing... flips thru notes... plant destroying fossil fuel lovers who run harvard and yale. 
choices matter."
33,"i don't care what you're protesting, interrupting harvard/yale is the quickest way to turn people against your cause."
34,"that’s how protests work bud. and thats why they work. yea, you’re annoyed and name calling, but you’re also talking about it. and the message they are sending is to get harvard and yale to divest from fossil fuel companies, so this is frankly a pretty smart way to convey a message using protest. but god forbid you feel some minor annoyance."
35,"i don’t think the individuals on the field are trying to garner optics points. they’re trying to send a message to harvard and yale. and are doing so effectively, whether you approve or not."
36,"the harvard football captain (a black man) sent a message that was in support of the protest. 

so don't need to imagine it since the representative for the harvard team said he supported the protesters and their message."
37,there are no athletic scholarships at harvard or yale. how did this protest hurt any players?
38,their goal was to stall the game to publicly shed light on harvard and yale’s continued investment in fossil fuels. they literally accomplished exactly that.
39,"maybe they should, but both yale student and harvard students and alumni joined to protest **their** universities' involvement in funding anti climate  corporations. its none of your business, nor mine.

gym jordan, lol. whats wrong with ohio voters?"
40,how so? because harvard's been hit? 
41,"after seeing the current events transpire, i would never hire a recent graduate from harvard, yale, or princeton. while i'd hope this is just a small minority of students supporting the recent surge of thought policing, the rest of the student body has all but remained silent.  

it just would not be worth the risk of hiring somebody who supports this movement towards thought policing, as i would have to operate my business in constant fear of offending their delicate sensitivities. i could not risk having a pc fascist threatening to protest & sue every time a manager uses a word they don't like, even if that word in context is completely benign. and god forbid i ever had to let them go for legitimate reasons, there is little chance i wouldn't be facing a discrimination lawsuit even if the employee was a straight, white male.

this type of childish behavior may work in college, but in the real world, it will not be tolerated."
42,"sorry, what? in what sense is yale the ""least favored among the ivy leagues""? 

are you talking in terms of ""controversies"" over racism? harvard and princeton just got rid of the word ""master."" princeton is trying to change the name of its woodrow wilson school. 

and yeah right, a bunch of professors are going to be leaving for dartmouth, brown or penn..."
43,"thanks for sharing these - i hadn't seen that google book before. lots of other interesting info in there too.

i remember reading somewhere that ewsp gets around 100 applicants per year, so if the original pot is that small then that's good news...

btw, what harvard program did you apply to that you got an interview? jw because i'm not aware of any pathways in except regular undergrad and the extension school, and the undergrad decisions were announced back in march (i applied, lol). i've done a lot of research on the extension school but it's not really the experience i want.

anyway, i wish you luck for your interview next week!"
44,"i just applied to the transfer program, if that is the one you're talking about i would imagine that they still haven't made any announcements on it because i haven't heard anything and the deadlines were in march. the freshman applications would have been due way earlier, so i'm guess that is what you meant? but i didn't try for the extension school, just the regular old harvard undergrad. 

and ty for the good wishes, hopefully i make it in. i am chasing a few leads atm so i can let you know if i find anything else out."
45,"so i'm speaking from ignorance here, so there might be details that i don't know about. but fenway only has marginally higher capacity than harvard stadium (30k vs 37k). i mean, i guess 7000 seats is a large number. but the direct cost of that is that it's a stadium which is obviously not suited to football, so acting like each of those seats is equivalent to a seat in a football stadium seems odd.

obviously, the bigger confusion is more about the tailgate and social scene. until i hear otherwise, i assume that tailgating will be massively restricted, i mean all there is are those cement parking lots? again, i don't know any details, just on the surface this doesn't make much sense to me. for most people (students and especially alums, who make up majority of attendees), the social event of the tailgate is the priority, not the football game (at this year's game, you barely saw the tailgating parking lots drain as the game began). so my assumption is that this change will seriously impact the tailgating. the direct benefit seems to be a few more seats, but fenway is still a remarkably small stadium, and many of those seats will have very poor view of a football game. to me it feels like the biggest draw is just the cache of having it at ""fenway park"", but bedsides the cool headline, on paper this seems worse for everyone involved.

or maybe they should just hold it at yale each year =p. it's nice not having to worry about tickets."
46,i’m a grad student and i see undergrads going out for parties every day of the week. i’ve also heard a number of pretty shocking and crazy stories about these parties. there’s also a ton of clubs and things to do constantly. not really sure where you’re getting the impression that there’s no school spirit or social scene. it’s yale - school spirit and parties started at schools like yale and harvard lol
47,"are you wondering what the sporting/athletic culture is like in general?

just to set proper expectations off the bat, yale doesn't have anywhere near the sports atmosphere or environment of a big d1 football or basketball powerhouse like usc or ohio state or florida or duke.

that being said, there is definitely still a lot of fun to be had supporting yale sports teams. 

football: i would say most people don't really care other than the game vs. harvard every year, which is attended by just about everyone on campus plus tons of alumni.

basketball: the yale team has actually been quite good in recent years, finishing at or near the top of the ivy league. we've gone to march madness twice in the past 4 years, upsetting baylor in the first round in 2016, and were set to go dancing again this year until covid-19 happened.

hockey: probably yale's strongest overall program in the major sports. we won a national championship in 2013 and the team is generally pretty competitive. going to hockey games at the whale is a really fun experience, and that's coming from someone who grew up in latitudes where it never snows.

other sports like tennis, lacrosse, squash, fencing: these are all ""bougie"" sports that i didn't have much experience with before going to yale, coming from a middle class background, but it's pretty interesting and fun overall to watch some of these competitions and learn more about them, especially if you have friends on those teams. that's another positive of yale in regards to athletics - the fact that the student community is so small and tight-knit, along with the residential college format, means that you'll likely be friends and classmates and roommates with  varsity athletes on various teams, which might not be the case at big schools with more cliques and fragmented social groups."
48,my current suitemate (who also happened to get into harvard rd and chose yale) 
49,r/harvard and r/enoughtrumpspam mod here sending much love to the yale law faculty for speaking up. yale law seems to be led by good people.

51,"scumbag harvard: bans vuvuzelas at home game, makes thundersticks for away game. "
52,i thought the harvard email paradigm was xxxx@fas.harvard.edu.
53,"then i would try to defer. i went to harvard for undergrad and yale for grad school, but freshman year is a time for staying up all night in the courtyard talking with new people and exploring extracurricular activities. the life at the undergraduate colleges at yale seemed to play an even larger role in student life than the houses at harvard, possibly because new haven is not as nice as cambridge and at least when i was there, it was far more dangerous."
54,"i never had the chance to visit either school, but compared to uchicago, (since i'm sure you had plenty of opportunity to see how it was like being from the area) do you get the sense that yale is significantly more collaborative than uc? also, i was interested in harvard for a long time, and i've seen plenty about the, frankly, shitshow their administration can make of some matters, and i haven't seen much like that from yale. the administration isn't that level of bad is it?"
55,"coming on the heels of [rachel williams' article](http://yaledailynews.com/weekend/2014/01/24/we-just-cant-have-you-here/) from earlier this year, this is disturbing. these two issues in one semester are two too many. i'm also reminded of the recently published article in the harvard crimson about poor administrative responses to sexual violence.

somebody needs to start holding the health system to the same standard as the academic system. when i got very, very ill my senior year at yale, my advisor, dean, and professors all immediately said, ""ok! tell us what you need and you've got it."" and i made it through. that's what the health system needs to do for our students. they need to take the students' perspectives on their own situations as part of the guidelines for how to treat their maladies. we are smart kids, at yale — we generally have pretty good advice on what we need."
56,"i've studied french, german, and japanese. i studied french and german in high school, took intensive japanese at harvard, and a refresher course in french at yale while a graduate student. mandarin obviously is a different language from japanese, but it is an ideographic language and japanese characters are derived from chinese characters. japanese was the most difficult language i've ever studied. the grammar and syntax are completely different. you have to start learning with a form of the language written in the roman alphabet before moving to the syllable alphabets and characters used in japanese. there are no familiar words for an english speaker, unlike in french or german.

i would say that french is easiest, then german, than chinese. when i took french at yale, many years ago, its french department was excellent. the teaching was good but also there were grammar drill exercises that students could check out and use, which was a more efficient use of time than constantly drilling students in the classroom. the classes were small and they met several times a week, which is essential for the early stages of learning a language. i once took a language at a community college for fun and could not believe it met only once a week."
57,"it is the one day a year where harvard and yale kids get a ""real"" football experience. it's nothing crazy by major college football standards, but it's huge for these two schools. very well attended, very good atmosphere. lots of alums and students in the stadium, lots of students and young alums skip the game entirely and just hang with their friends at the tailgate"
58,"interesting and thanks for the responses! 

i haven't started yet (i'm just a pre-frosh) but, judging from the article it does seem that there has been a sharp increase of people moving off-campus. i get the whole cost element but i do wonder why there's such a drastic difference between harvard -- where almost no one moves out of the houses -- to yale where almost half of seniors do.

https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/11/15/off-campus-housing-on-the-rise/"
59,"harvard in is boston, a big city with big city housing costs."
60,"unfortunately, none us undergrads have actually attended harvard or stanford. while we love to rehash old stereotypes of cut-throat harvard students, we can't really claim that one is more or less competitive than the other.

i've personally found yale, and my residential college in particular, to be very tight knit. unlike colleges in nyc/boston where people spread out all over on weekends, there's not a whole lot else to do in new haven, which means campus life takes center stage. this includes a ton of underground performances, suite parties, nearby restaurants, frats or student group events. 

with regards to students, all my peers are certainly driven, but i've never felt that people were ever competing against each other - we are all just striving towards our own goals.

lastly, i think yale's campus is simply a lot more beautiful to look at. harvard and stanford are nice, but they don't have as many stunningly beautiful places to match say, sterling library, branford courtyard, hillhouse avenue or the art gallery."
61,"from my experience people love the giant social and extracurricular scene at yale with the cappella groups, comedy groups, orchestras, and more. i honestly think these are the best parts of yale. other schools like harvard and stanford definitely are not as big in this respect. i’ve personally spoken with harvard kids about it.  also going to toads, the dance club, is super popular."
62,"i'm an undergrad at yale, so here's my 2 cents worth:

the facilities and professors are top notch. the wright lab (http://wlab.yale.edu/) has recently been completely refurbished, the sterling laboratory has reopened, yale's west campus is growing (http://westcampus.yale.edu/), and i think a few more buildings are in the pipeline. we also have a cool little planetarium, and access to observatories across the globe. the professors come from the same pool as all other top physics programs, so i assume the teaching quality is similar, but class sizes tend to be smaller and more intimate.

with regards to grad school admissions, i think a similar student who goes to harvard and yale will fare equally well. the relatively smaller cohort of students means it should be easy to get good letters of recommendation (which are one of the most important criteria for grad school admissions). a quick search https://www.physics.harvard.edu/academics/phds shows that yalies are pretty well represented at top grad school programs. 


i think the area where yale really shines is the whole undergrad experience - as one of the most competitive colleges to get into, your peers will on average be really smart, quirky, artistic, funny and/or ambitious and you will learn from them as much as you do from your classes. unlike technical institutes like mit/caltech, you'll be friends with people for whom music/drama/philosophy, etc. are not just side interests but major passions. the only possible downside that i can perceive is that physical sciences/engineering won't dominate mainstream conversation and culture the way they might do at mit/caltech/stanford (though this is a good thing in my opinion).

oh and yale is pretty generous with financial aid for international students, if that matters to you."
63,gr8 cya at harvard 😤😤
64,i think the figure for harvard is around 50%. 
65,"missing out on what, exactly? columbia is prestigious, but yale is more prestigious. the majority of cross-admits go to yale. twice as many yale grads attend hbs and stanford gsb as columbia grads. twice as many yale grads attend yale law school/stanford law school/harvard law school as columbia grads. the rhodes/marshall scholarship counts are not even close (in favor of yale). yale grads even do slightly better than columbia grads at getting into stem phd programs even though yale is less focused on stem than columbia. most of this is self-selection, and you can do fine at columbia too, but i really don't get what you're missing out on by turning down columbia..."
66,"i haven't heard of any plans to build a new building. the jackson institute/school was always meant to be a small community. so it probably won't expand until it has to.

&#x200b;

many students are upset that yale has decided to pour $200m into the jackson school while it has bigger current issues to worry about: the department of ethnicity, race, and migration (er&m) is dying, and yale is refusing to remove the student income contribution (sic). as a recipient of financial aid, i feel the pain of the sic. however, i understand that yale is legally required to found the jackson school due to a contract signed with the primary donor 10 years ago.

&#x200b;

another issue is that the jackson school is the second building at yale named after a living donor. (the first building in general named after a living donor was the schwarzman center, after steve schwarzman '69). yale has historically balked at doing this. even charles johnson '54 with his $250m donation couldn't sway yale to name a new residential college after him. however, i personally don't see this broken naming tradition as much of a problem.

&#x200b;

imo yale should've founded the jackson school a long time ago. harvard, princeton, and columbia already have professional schools for public policy or international affairs. yale is behind in taking advantage of its own traditional reputation in political science."
67,"i don't think the issue was with naming a building after the jacksons. it was with naming an entire school after a donor, which hasn't been traditionally done at yale, unlike say the kennedy school at harvard. i personally don't see any issue with it."
68,"relatively though, yale's still hiring at a slower pace than bigger departments like harvard's or even mit's -- yale cs seems to have just gotten out of its long hiring freeze, more or less.

scaz has also been here since '06, as it happens."
69,"i agree. i go to some games and yale has a pretty shit crowd lol (except for games against harvard). basketball at pwg against harvard was packed+loud, but the last home game against dartmouth was fairly weak until late in the second. "
70,"in a nutshell - 

cambridge & boston >> new haven 

yale's campus culture >> harvard 

choose whichever is more important to you, there's no right answer"
71,"seconded. i sound biased as a yalie, but yale’s campus culture is unbeatable in the ivy league, imo, especially compared to harvard. that being said, i would love to have experienced living in or around boston."
72,also yale’s campus >> harvard
73,"agree with this. to be more specific, i found yale a lot more warm and nurturing in comparison to harvard when i visited. cambridge is cool, but it felt cold and impersonal. yale just has a really cool culture and community feel."
74,re the harvard comment: when i was at harvard-yale i asked my harvard friends about where to party and they said we likely wouldn't find anywhere that was open because the lsat was the next day. like wtf why are they so lame. 
75,"""calhoun"" had to change. that just makes sense. i've the feeling if yale had made that big change in 2015, the smaller head/master issue wouldn'tve have had as much momentum.

but perhaps not.  harvard and princeton also changed the title of master to head, the same year."
76,"kudos, dude.

calhoun has they best [buttery](http://calhoun.yalecollege.yale.edu/trolley-stop) of all 12 residential colleges—'nuff said. (it's also the most centrally located.)

yale is unabashedly itself. i think it attracts a quirky sort of person, and yale has never seemed embarrassed to showcase that quirkiness. no one ""culture"" dominates the campus (though it reputedly has a more artsy vibe than its peer institutions) and i really like the way students rally behind conventionally ""uncool"" things, like the [juggling club](http://www.yaleantigravity.org/) or the [marching band](http://www.yale.edu/yaleband/ypmb/). i've heard from friends at similar places (princeton, harvard, etc) that the high school mentality still reigns supreme...whereas yalies seem to respect eccentric passions not in spite of their weirdness, but *because* of their weirdness. (eating clubs and final clubs also exert a much bigger social chokehold on princeton and harvard respectively than secret societies do at yale—but that's another story for another day.)

yale is firmly undergraduate-focused, but the graduate resources are available in the background (i'm a sophomore taking a class at the law school). that's a kind of balance you won't find at schools of yale's ilk. i also think the yale student body is particularly well-rounded, more so than ""cerebral"" schools like uchicago.

yeah, so that, in a nutshell, is why i think yale is a singularly awesome place. i'd be happy to talk about more specifics (like the unique [directed studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directed_studies_at_yale_university) program) if you want.

as for surprise, i was taken aback by the nocturnal nature of college life. i would've never dreamed during high school that i'd be staying up regularly 'til 3 or 4am. something about yale dance parties also awakened a hitherto dormant dance beast within me. who knew i could bust moves with such zeal?"
77,"yeah, directed studies sounds really cool. does taking the course cut down on the number of science courses i could take? i'm probably going to focus on science, at least at first, and i assume i have to fill those distribution requirements anyways...

you win the prize for scaring me away from harvard and princeton! if there's anything i'm sick of, it's the high school mentality."
78,stanford shouldn't be on the list. and there's no way in hell we should be ahead of princeton/harvard.
79,"it wouldn’t matter. if he prefers one over the other, pick that one. it depends on what he wants to get out of his time in college. 

the one was in which it would matter would be if he wants his career to be based in silicon valley, night as well start there now at stanford, so he’ll have more friends and connections and whatnot in the area. if he wants to be in ny or boston, then yale. but other than that, he should look at the other aspects of the university. he’d be able to get the same jobs coming from either (or harvard, princeton, etc)."
80,"yeah this is my main concern about committing to yale...i was hoping that people would be very open-minded but when i joined the yale group chat, someone mentioned a group of upenn/harvard republican students talking about the economy and there was immediate backlash, to quote ""mini-trumps"", ""grosssss"", ""assholes with superiority complexes"", ""compensating for insecurities"", etc. maybe it was just the harvard hate...but it really sickened me that they'd act that way upon mentioning republicans. 

i also found [this article](https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4410-conservative-at-yale) talking about being conservative at yale, and it seems like conservative students still receive hostility to some extent.

but, even if the general population is anti-conservative, there are still definitely groups at yale where you'd fit in (independent party, yale college republicans, the federalist party, etc). 

take what i've said above with a grain of salt though, since i'm not an official yale student (yet?)"
81,"yes people get into top 10 phd programs (also yale is a top 10 phd program itself according to mit’s list i think), research opportunities are solid (although pure math research in general is kinda hard to do in undergrad), and you take 1-3 math courses per semester as a math major, depending on how hard you’re going.

the math department/math majors are extremely close, especially if you take the 230/231 track. also since the department is smaller than maybe princeton or harvard or other typical math schools, it might be easier to do well/be recognized."
82,harvard and yale’s administrations
83,"i'm from the midwest us. i was given a harvard mousepad at 10 and laughed because that was a foreign world to me. and now i'm a yale alumnus. i cared about my act because i'm ""that guy"" who cares. if you aren't, that's fine; but if you want to stand a good chance of getting in, you need to. yale basically has a flexible base of scores it requires (gpa 3.7 but 36 act=fine; gpa 4.5 but 32 act=fine; gpa 3.7 but 32 act=""thanks for applying but no). (please understand the previous statement is not from the admissions office; i'm going off my understanding as a former student and person who is interested in the field). if you're trying to go to school in the us, devote everything you can to getting the best act and sat scores possible, and take around 3 sat-2s. "
84,"i'd be careful in making such a broad generalisation. i didn't get interviewed for yale, but i remember during my harvard interview the interviewer asked me for a resume. so it might be better to come prepared.."
85,yeah but i think harvard interviewers are told so as well? some of them evidently don’t follow it. so it never hurts to be prepared...

90,"sure, the compensation is excellent, but it was fought for. it's instructive to talk to faculty who were grads in the 90s and even early 00s. the present funding package was not designed by the good graces or altruism of yale admin, as it happens.

i do agree that the hunger strike is somewhat extreme. on the other hand, the bbq was not only in poor taste but simply petty. it does nobody any service.

and it's not a matter of ""if i say so."" you're welcome to find out more about some of the less-rosy aspects of graduate life at yale. just talk to people. top ten institutions mean nothing. columbia and harvard, too, are seeing fights for graduate unionization. not for no reason."
91,"sounds like they may have made a mistake in the calculations. just ask them to recalculate and explain your confusion given what the net price calculator estimated and that your family only makes $x.

if you get into harvard, princeton, stanford, etc. — one of the grant-based, full financial need schools — and they come back with a very different aid package, yale will recalculate (and i think probably match?) but i know you'd obviously have to wait for an rd round for that to happen. remember though, if they let you in, they really want you to come."

93,"columbia is the probably the worst among the ivies for aid for internationals, except maybe brown. yale, on the other hand, was probably the best or second to harvard. financial aid was not the only factor in my decision, but personally there was no world in which i would have personally gone to columbia over yale if accepted into both."
94,"i could be wrong (it’s been a couple of years for me) but i don’t think there is alcohol. the gym only has a dinky little snack bar that doesn’t have much of anything. and i believe they check bags too so i don’t know if you’d be able to bring stuff in. 

also, while basketball games at yale can be really fun (especially against harvard) do not go in expecting anything near purdue levels of atmosphere/game day experience."
95,"i was a yale physics major so i can definitely comment!

the yale physics program is actually quite strong, and i think it would certainly allow you to get into any top grad program you wanted if you did well. although i ended up working in data science, all my friends who went to grad school got into really great physics phd programs (like harvard and mit). it is certainly an extremely rewarding major, but especially if you do the intensive major, it’s probably one of the more challenging programs at yale.

as for physics 180/181, to be completely candid with you, i didn’t know any physics major that took that sequence, as that really is for pre-meds and probably not what you’re looking for. my pre-med suite mates took it and it seemed like a basic standard college physics course but certainly not as richly calculus based as you’d want as a major.

so if you know you want to major in physics and have the high school background (namely physics c), i’d highly recommend taking physics 260/261, as it is really the intro sequence designed for physics majors and presents some really cool topics like gr in an accessible way. the most challenging part of 260/261 may be the math as you really need math 120 (multivariable calculus) - you can take math 120 as a corequisite but if you’ve never seen multivariable at all it may be more challenging. (i actually took 260/261 sophomore year after having taken math 120 freshman year and i felt that this made things relatively easier).

the other option is to take the more engineering focused 200/201 which i know a few physics majors who did and enjoyed, but i’d still recommend 260/261 as it’s really the intro sequence for anyone who wants to major in physics and has a strong math background."
96,"hey i'm not a physics major but am an engineering major at yale and have plenty of friends who are physics majors here so i can comment.  to reply to your previous comment, if you've taken ap calculus through bc calculus and never any other physics, i would recommend shopping phys 200 and phys 260 when you get here and seeing which one you like better. over the years, it seems that 260 is a better-taught course than 200, but the professors recently switched so it may be different. ultimately, you should take math 120 (multivariable calculus) or math 230 (proof-based multivariable calculus and real analysis) concurrently with your intro course. math 230 i would only recommend if you have extensive proof-based math background and are really looking to get into the proof side of math along with your physics education. the great thing about yale is that you have the opportunity to ""shop"" the courses (i.e. phys 200 and 260) at the same time up until ~2 weeks into the semester so you can see which one is better for you. i have had friends take the phys 180/181, 200/201, and 260/261 intro course sequence and still become physics majors, so it's not going to stop you from becoming a major no matter which sequence you take. however, from experience i think 200/201 or 260/261 are the best to prepare you for future courses in the major. i would take a look at the [yale physics major required courses] (http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/physics/) or the [helpful page here] (https://physics.yale.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies/guide-introductory-physics-course) to see exactly what you should be taking other than the intro courses for the major.

as for your question on research/faculty and graduate school admissions, the good thing is that yale physics is on the smaller side, so getting research experience is really easy. as an engineering major here, i've worked in two labs and co-authored six papers here during my time due to the ease of working with faculty and the fact that they treat you like graduate students if you put in enough time. the physics major also lets you do research for credit (phys 469/470) as first-year and sophomore as pass/fail and (phys 471/472) as junior and senior for letter grade, so you can do this during the semester for your major and fulfill requirements that way. for the summer, yale has a variety of [summer research grants for undergraduates] (https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/yale-science-engineering-research/fellowship-grants) which give you a stipend to live in new haven and conduct research with a faculty member. they are usually approximately $4300-$4500 per summer, which is more than enough to do research and walk away with a little extra money after the summer ends. yale has good placement in graduate school admissions because what matters for that is letters of recommendation and research experience, and faculty tend to write very good letters here since research experience is easy to get, and the labs are small enough that the faculty will get to know you very well. one example i would give you is just to go on any yale faculty's website and look at where the ""former undergraduate students"" have gone on to graduate school, like [prof. david demille's website here] (https://demillegroup.yale.edu/former-undergraduate-students), who has sent most of his former undergraduates to harvard or stanford phd programs (and this is just one example of many).

course-wise, your intro course sequence (etc. phys 260/261) will be accompanied by an intro laboratory course sequence for physics (phys 205l/206l). after your first year, you will generally take one semester advanced classical mechanics (phys 410), one semester electrodynamics (phys 430), one semester thermodynamics/statistical mechanics (phys 420), two semesters of quantum mechanics (phys 440/441), and advanced physics lab (phys 382l). beyond this, you will be able to take any electives in the undergraduate or graduate school to supplement your education; popular ones include solid-state physics (phys 448/449), particle physics (phys 442), and other courses in astrophysics and graduate school of physics. of course, you should also take more math classes such as linear algebra (math 222 or 225) and ordinary/partial differential equations (enas 194 or math 246 and math 247). many physics majors will supplement their major with advanced proof-based math in case they want to go into physics theory graduate school.
