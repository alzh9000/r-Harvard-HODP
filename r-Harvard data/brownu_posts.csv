HappyPenguinInc,"One of the biggest fears that every incoming freshman has when coming to Brown, or any other school, is always: ""What if I don't make any friends?"" This is a completely valid concern, of course. College is stressful, and big, and most of the time, you don't know a single person there. But as someone who went from having zero to many friends, I'm here to tell you, that you will eventually find your people.

I didn't actually have that many friends for the first half of freshman fall. The people I hung out with at orientation were the people who lived on my floor. And while I really liked them, and enjoyed the time we spent together, I never really clicked into the group. I got so worried about the fact that everyone I talked to seemed to have some group of friends to hang out with, but I didn't. I felt like the only person who wasn't in a group.

It took a little bit of time, and some effort, to start slowly building a network of friends around me. I met a girl in one of my classes, and around the middle of the semester, actually mustered up the courage to talk to her. I started getting closer to people on my sports team. I met people through clubs, random activities, or just in chance encounters in a library.

Now, as I go into my junior year, I have many friends that I didn't meet until sophomore spring. Hell, I made some new friends just this week that already feel like close companions. So don't stress about not having a group of people in your first week here; friends will come, and they'll be worth the wait.",A note to all the incoming freshman: You will find friends,88,1.0,cx4r5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/cx4r5t/a_note_to_all_the_incoming_freshman_you_will_find/,9,1567131843.0,2019-08-29 21:24:03

paxonhamber,"I'm a little hesitant to write about this, but I did get a weird, slightly guilty feeling from attending and what I saw, so I thought I'd write a bit about it.

I obviously want to keep anonymous because of the current atmosphere around here, but for a bit of background: I was certainly invited because of my parents' stature and relationship with MG. My parents are pretty wealthy, but no one you would've heard of unless you happen to be closely connected to the industry my mom is huge in. My dad is also a kind of bigwig in a specific medical field, so they've known MG for a while now and it's just kind of a professional courtesy for him to invite people like me.

Anyway, they got a lot of stuff right in the ProJo article, so I'll skip that mundane stuff and try and add what I can with my perspective. I actually went last year, not this year (for embarrassing, Bajas related reasons), but I assume it was pretty similar.

As my Lyft approached Al Forno, I tried to remember what my parents had told me in preparation for the dinner: mention them by name (so MG knew who I was), talk to him about my interest in business, and something about the word ""fidelio"". I checked the pockets of my Canada Goose to make sure I hadn't left my iPhone XS Max and Juul in the car, and walked in. When I got to receptionist at Al Forno, I mentioned that I was there for the MG dinner. She told me that it was actually a private event, but asked me if there was anything else I wanted to mention? I was kind of confused, but remembered what my dad had said and mumbled ""uhh, f..fidelio?"" She gave me a knowing smile and welcomed me. Huh, I thought my dad had just been joking.

She started walking into the kitchen, so I just stood waiting, but after a couple seconds she realized I wasn't following her and told me to follow. Weird! I followed her, past the delicious wafts, to the back right corner of the kitchen. We got to a huge, knurled door that looked *very* out of place in the back of Al Forno's otherwise modern-clean kitchen, but it didn't look bad, either. Strangely, there was no handle on the door, but there was a small hole in the wall, about an inch wide, at about ankle height, from the door. She told me to hang on a sec, and knelt down. I couldn't see super well because the area by the door wasn't lit very well, but she definitely reached into her mouth, winced a little, and then put something into the hole. The door immediately creaked open and I stepped into the foyer. The receptionist wiped the corner of her mouth and told me to enjoy. The door closed behind her, and I noticed that this side didn't seem to have a handle, either.

Even the foyer was nice, though a tad strange. There was a doorman, but his eyes were closed and he didn't speak. He did, however, gesture for my coat, whimpering a little, and I handed it to him. He reached into his pockets (which seemed to make...wet sounds?) and produced a token in exchange for my coat. It was a little lock of red hair, about 3"" long, with a LV band around it. It seemed like there were little clumps of skin at one end of the lock of hair, but that's probably just some fashion thing I don't understand. 

I entered the main room, and damn, it was pretty! I went to the wine bar, where there was another man similar to the doorman. I got a wine of a name, color, smell, and taste I had never seen before. Everyone was already mingling. I saw a few people I recognized from class there, talking to wealthy looking older folks. It's kind of funny, when you imagine a special event with the ""ultra rich"", you might imagine $4,000 tailored suits, but most of these people were...pretty casual. A lot of dadcore, bad docksiders with baggy polo shirts, if you catch my drift. Then again, I guess you can dress like that when you buy and sell lesser lives as a side business. 

Except for MG. Though I had never actually met him, despite going to his nephew's Bar Mitzvah ages ago, I guess I expected a typical 81 year old man. He was anything but. The first reason you'll notice him is that he's gotta be 6'8"", maybe more since he was hunched over to talk to the craven plebes near him. He's also just... *bronze*. And not in a trashy Trump way, but like he just got off the yacht from Mallorca. He's also weirdly yoked. He was wearing a beautifully tailored suit, in light tan, but it actually looked almost white against his glowing golden skin. And it wasn't of any material I had ever seen; it had an amazing texture, like leather, but finer, smoother.

I had only been admiring him from a distance, passing the time until I got a chance with him by talking to another alumnus about his visionary business leveraging blockchain tech for disruptive AI to harness CRISPR or something. MG was periodically scanning the room he could see, but I was at about a 160 degree angle behind him, so he never saw me. As the alum was saying something about big data derivatives and his ethical role in tanking the Haitian economy, I suddenly started hearing... I'm not sure, Icelandic? chanting in my head. It seemed like no one else in the room could hear it. It was quickly getting louder and louder, drowning out the visionary, and I began to sway on my feet. Suddenly, I saw MG's head whip around to look me directly in the eyes, and it stopped as if I had never heard anything.

He excused himself from the current gaggle with a well-timed outro quip and lurched over to us. I say lurched, because I've never seen anything move like that before. It wasn't awkward; if anything, it was stealthy and elegant. It might be partly because of his size, but I didn't even hear any of his footsteps. He introduced himself with a rogueish smile and said  ""...and you must be ___ ________"", using my nickname that only my closest friends call me. Closer, he smelled faintly of sandalwood, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. While intently asking me about my interests, at one point he sneezed. It could have been the mystery vino and soft lighting, but I swear that as he was opening his eyes post-sneeze, they seemed to open sideways. 

I honestly don't know how long we talked, or what we talked about, but it felt like hours. He was wonderful at conversation, polite yet engaged, making it seem like what I was saying at that moment was the only thing in the world he cared about. He asked how my family was doing, and asked me in which order I would consume them. When I caught a glimpse of my watch, it said 7:50, but that didn't really make sense: the watch's hour hand was barely past the 7, and I had gotten out of the Lyft at 7:35 PM. But I wasn't going to complain; talking to him was the happiest I had been in as long as I could remember.

Finally it was my turn to lose him, and he excused himself. He lurched to the center of the room and the lights dimmed slightly. We all instantly stopped (how could you not?) and turned our gazes to him, though it felt out of my control anyway. He barely moved his lips, but his voice filled the room, almost painfully loud. The red velvet on the walls suddenly seemed a little redder. He uttered that he had summoned someone very special there tonight, and from a spiral staircase in the center of the room that no one had noticed until that moment, up came Christina Paxson. She was wearing a Supreme hoodie that they had only released a non-integer number of, as well as Stan Smiths, but they weren't the classic white. They were a color and texture similar to MG's suit.

He said that it was time to consume of the knowledge of The Book. From her Fjallraven Kanken, CPax withdrew a tome of a texture not unlike her shoes, telling us it was a very special one from the John Hay library and that its contents would allow us to maximize the material in our capitalist paradise. As she said that, her eyes glimmered, and something in MG's pants rustled.

Oh, and what secrets they were. Though they were speaking backwards, alternating words, we understood all and I cannot go back to the time before. They told us to walk the garden of forking paths, but beware the fox eating itself. They told us that recycling is nonsense and that though gender is arbitrary, so is human life, so don't feel guilty if you must carve a mural of pain into flesh to succeed in the world of business. They told us how to fold a fitted sheet and to invest in vape-pacifiers, because they heard a hot tip that they would be legalized by 2023. Periodically, MG climbed into an Apparatus that inscribed these words into his back.

They began to tell us of MG's philanthropic miracles. His gills flared wealthily, and four of the eyeless eunuchs brought out his first generous donation to Brown: a life sized metal bull, almost as bronze as the deity himself. They also dragged out a cowering, nude, filthy child, his pupils the size of dinner plates, on a Gucci 2018 A/W leash. The eunuchs opened a door on the bull's rear, and MG produced from his beautiful suit an LED fidget spinner. Instantly the child snapped to attention, transfixed on the spinner. MG tossed it into the bull, and the child, released, scrambled after it on all fours into the bull. To be fair, it was a pretty sweet fidget spinner. They slammed the door shut and lit a fire beneath it, and then everyone clapped.

As the first hors d'oeuvres were being brought out by his wretched minions, CPax unzipped her humanskin. ""Holy shit"", I thought. ""They have *pigs in a blanket?""*",I attended one of the Granoff dinners. Here's a bit about my experience there,77,0.91,ax8u1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/ax8u1u/i_attended_one_of_the_granoff_dinners_heres_a_bit/,12,1551744862.0,2019-03-04 18:14:22

ChessMaster22,"""For these reasons, we have made the very difficult decision to move academic instruction for all undergraduate and graduate students to remote learning effective Monday, March 30.

Undergraduate students who live in on-campus residences or Brown-owned properties must vacate their residences as soon as possible and no later than **Sunday, March 22**, and complete the semester from their homes or at an alternate location away from campus. Exceptions will be made for undergraduate students whose circumstances would prevent them from leaving campus due to international travel restrictions or other extraordinary circumstances.

Classes will be cancelled during the week of March 16 so that faculty have time to prepare to transition courses to remote learning, and students have time to pack and arrange for travel. Reading week will be devoted to making up the missed week of classes, and faculty can plan to teach during that period. These changes do not apply to most students in the Warren Alpert Medical School, which will communicate any changes or restrictions directly to medical students.""",Brown will cancel the week of March 16th and transition to remote learning effective March 30th,49,0.98,fhg5nb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/fhg5nb/brown_will_cancel_the_week_of_march_16th_and/,2,1584047720.0,2020-03-12 16:15:20

TheEnemyOfMyAnenome,"I'm not on facebook so I'm pretty out of the loop on stuff. But it's absolutely insane how few courses are being offered. Am I wrong to be surprised by this, did I miss an email or something?

I'm a 4th year engineering student and pretty much none of the courses I planned on taking are being offered. I mean there are courses in GEOL and ASYR I was considering, and I looked and neither of those departments even exist in the fall? I don't even know how I'm filling my upper-level science req, not to mention what concentrators are supposed to do.

wttpehoekhoa,"Got in as a Freshman.

Chose Columbia because my enlightened decision making process was ""hurr us news"". 

There's literally no CS community there. There's not even a single coding club... yes, *not even a single one*. ""But isn't there at least -?"" NOPE. Nothing. Unless your idea of coding is Goldman Sachs Investment Banking internships.

So, my first question would be -- does Brown have a good number of coding clubs?

Second question is more subjective but yikes, I don't really enjoy the ""vibe"" at Columbia. The classes are a constant beat down -- tests frequently average in the 50s -- and nothing matters because it's all curved to a B- at the end of the semester anyway. Oh, and I haven't taken a single class I care about yet because... what's an 18-year-old's self-discovery process without a bit of oppressive core curriculum and a side of 400 page rants about the corn harvest in 1582.

My biggest issue though is the community here. There is no community. I don't enjoy the nonexistent personal space, the lack of nature, and the isolation fueled by the insane workload and NYC in general. When I visited Brown, I got this sense of an awesome community where it's really easy to make friends and have fun (perhaps I am naive in that sense? Would anyone care to disillusion me?) 

I guess where I am right now is that Columbia is kind of miserable and I don't think it's worth it. Could I survive 4 more years? Probably. But I am finding success in my professional career, getting the internships ect that I want and suffering here for no apparent reason -- all of these things have come from my own hard work and not the school's ""brand-name"" or whatever (who cares about that in CS anyway if it's not Stanford?).

Bruno1771,"As someone in a frat here, I thought I‚Äôd give my 2 cents on every frat before rush starts to help people make good decisions when it comes to rush. I‚Äôll try to be as neutral as possible and really just lay out the facts:

Sigma Chi: the classic ‚Äòfratty‚Äô frat. Parties hard, tough pledging process, and a pretty selective rush process. Probably the closest thing brown has to what frats at other schools are like. Lots of people love them, lots hate them.

Delta Phi: Pretty much the lax frat with some other random athletes and a few rich New York kids. They also party hard, and expect to see some hard drugs here also. Been on and off probation for a while and just got kicked off campus again this fall, but expect them to keep operating underground. Their underground status will make rush pretty difficult if you don‚Äôt know any brothers.

Beta Rho: the Jewish frat, but a lot of the frat isn‚Äôt actually Jewish and I‚Äôve heard the religion stuff does not impact them at all day to day. They also party pretty hard (and have really stepped it up in the past year), but have more of a ‚Äòwork hard, play hard‚Äô vibe and are definitely more academic than sigma/dphi.

Dtau- The weed frat. Tons of drugs, not a lot of partying. If it‚Äôs the scene you want then it‚Äôs a great place to join, so I‚Äôd recommend checking them out once because you‚Äôll either love it or hate it. Currently in some sort of sexual assault scandal and no sororities will mix with them.

Phi Psi- also known as lantern. Kicked off campus for rape four years ago but have been existing underground since. Have a super close knit brotherhood but their name still has some negative connotations from the sexual assault incident. They also can‚Äôt provide housing for sophomores because they aren‚Äôt recognized by the university.

Zete: the lbgtq+ frat. Super diverse, very quirky. They party pretty hard but their parties also have a very unique vibe. Another frat that‚Äôs probably good to check out once just to see if you like the vibe.

Thete: the football/wrestling/few other random athletes frat. It‚Äôs hobestly unclear if they party a lot or if they just all go to football parties (and the fb team definitely parties hard); I think the distinction between football and thete is pretty blurred. If you really want to hang with athletes it‚Äôs a good place to check out, but I‚Äôve also heard that it can be a little weird to be a non-athlete in thete.

ADPhi- Gender inclusive literary society. They don't throw big parties but I know the members do like to have fun in smaller groups. Definitely a little quirky, but the people I know in it are all huge fans. 

Tech House- Program house that stems from an interest in technology. Have lots of interesting events (ie what happens when you microwave a bunch of different things). Pretty nerdy vibe, definitely doesn't feel like a frat.

Buxton- A co-ed program house that is essentially a frat for international kids. You don't need to be international to join, but most people are international along with a few others who are just friends with the international kids. Lots of hard drugs. Weird rush process. I've heard some rumors about some weirdness about how the male members interact with and view the female members. Pretty conservative and incredibly wealthy. 

If anyone has any questions, I‚Äôd be happy to answer in the comments! ",Guide to brown frats,38,0.93,a41gwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/a41gwc/guide_to_brown_frats/,12,1544229029.0,2018-12-07 18:30:29
Ultralightream,"In the past two days, I've gotten 5 or so emails about the election, offering things like support groups, and the most recent one being titled ""Being a TA or Mentor Following the Election"". 

Does anyone else find this really embarrassing?

Look, lemme be clear here. I voted for Bernie, and I voted for HRC. I am *not* a fan of Trump, and the results of his reign could range from undoing recent progress I (we) like, to actual disaster (let's be honest, probably unlikely). He's a real shitbird, and I wish he hadn't been elected. If he chokes to death on a gold-plated piece of broccoli and keels over before January, I won't shed a tear.

That said, it makes me kind of cringe when we get these emails that are shamelessly partisan and coddling. I think we (Brown) are already walking a very fine line where we risk not being taken seriously (by people outside of our echo chamber) if we pigeonhole ourselves too much. To me, it seems analogous to anyone who's experienced a little kid falling down: if you look at them and laugh, they'll often laugh too. If you instead rush over saying *oh my god you poor thing!*, they burst into tears. I think things like these emails both make us, and make us appear, to be this fragile circlejerk that kind of goes against one of the main points of going to college.

## Full post: http://bit.ly/33iG8yr

> So what I have seen a lot of is recommendations for how to try to avoid getting coronavirus in the first place -- good handwashing -- but what I have NOT seen a lot of is advice for what happens if you actually get it, which many of us will. So as your friendly neighborhood RN, let me make some suggestions.

> You basically just want to prepare as though you know you‚Äôre going to get a nasty respiratory bug, like bronchitis or pneumonia. You just have the foresight to know it‚Äôs coming.

> Things you should actually buy ahead of time (not sure what the obsession with toilet paper is?): Kleenex, Acetaminophen (Tylenol) in 325 mg tablets, **Note: do NOT use Ibuprofen** ~~Ibuprofen (Advil) in 200 mg tablets~~, Mucinex, Robitussin or whatever your generic cough medicine of choice is (check the label and make sure you're not doubling up on acetaminophen - some brands like DayQuil have it included and you don't want that). You want a cough medicine with both a cough suppressant and expectorant. Vix vaporub for your chest is also a great suggestion.

> If you don‚Äôt have a humidifier, that would be a good thing to buy and run in your room when you go to bed overnight. (You can also just turn the shower on hot and sit in the bathroom breathing in the steam). If you have a history of asthma and you have a prescription inhaler, make sure the one you have isn‚Äôt expired and refill it/get a new one if it is.

> This is also a good time to meal prep: make a big batch of your favorite soup to freeze and have on hand. Whatever your favorite clear fluids are to drink (Sprite, juice, ICE waters, Fresca, whatever floats your boat), stock your pantry with those. Maybe get some nice soothing tea too!

> For symptom management, use the meds I mentioned. For a fever over 101, alternate Tylenol 650 mg and Advil 400 mg so you‚Äôre taking a dose of one then the other every 3 hours.

> Drink A TON, hydrate hydrate hydrate. Rest lots. You should not be leaving your house except to go to the doctor, and if you do, wear a mask (regular is fine, you don‚Äôt need an N95). You DO NOT NEED TO GO TO THE ER unless you are having trouble breathing or your fever is very high (over 103.5 F/39 C) and unmanaged with meds. 90% of healthy adult cases thus far have been managed at home with basic rest/hydration/over-the-counter meds. We don‚Äôt want to clog the ERs unless you‚Äôre actually in distress. The hospital beds will be used for people who actively need oxygen/breathing treatments/IV fluids.

> If you have a pre-existing lung condition (COPD, emphysema, lung cancer) or are on immunosuppressants, now is a great time to talk to your PCP or specialist about what they would like you to do if you get sick. They might have plans to get you admitted and bypass the ER entirely.

> One major relief to you parents is that kids do VERY well with coronavirus‚Äî they usually bounce back in a few days, NO ONE under 18 has died *(Edit: As of March 24, one individual under 18 has died from COVID-19 in Lancaster, California.)*, and almost no kids have required hospitalization (unless they have a lung disease like CF). Just use pediatric dosing of the same meds.

&#x200B;

 

1. Fitting in at Brown

\- you earned admittance. You belong. 

\- Not whether, but how. Make friends in class.

\-Wait before extracurriculars. Be guided by curiosity and passion. 

\-Get off the Hill. 

&#x200B;

2. College work

\- HW = more and harder 

\- be humble

\- you‚Äôre not going to get ‚ÄúA‚Äùs

\- independence in study

\- GO TO CLASS!

\- turn coursework in on time

\- if you need help, ask. No one but you knows. 

\- talk to people. 

&#x200B;

3. Choosing classes

\- 4 classes per term only

\- variety is the spice of live. Large and small classes, daily assignments, final exams or   final papers. Diversity portfolio.

\- spread out your course schedule

\- study foreign language

\- take risks and be bold

&#x200B;

4. Liberal learning

\- open-minded/critical thinking = ability to write/speak/live and make it in the world

\- science and history, culture and the human condition. Find your voice. What do   you think/believe/argue with a subject? 

\- NO relationship between concentration and career

\- people look at who you are, rather than what you do

\- get to know your professors! (office hours, research, outside class, inside class, etc.)",Congrats to ED '23 people!

ADeepCommittment,"Dear Students, 

I hope that you and your loved ones are well, and that you have been able to reconnect with your classmates and instructors today. Our primary goal in the coming weeks is to continue to support all students, including those most directly impacted by this crisis, with individualized (academic, financial, and personal) advising as well as systematic support. 

I am writing to address student concerns about Brown‚Äôs decision on how to handle grading this semester. Consistent with Brown‚Äôs student-centered approach to education, we believe it is important to empower students to make educational choices for themselves, even when these choices are difficult. After widespread consultation with faculty and students, we adopted a policy that lets students revisit decisions to take courses S/NC up until April 17th. In addition, faculty may request that their course(s) be converted to mandatory S/NC. 

In the past week, I have received numerous emails from students who would prefer a ‚Äúuniversal pass‚Äù system, where everyone automatically receives a passing grade, arguing that this is the most equitable approach in the current circumstances. I have also heard from many students from a broad range of backgrounds who have argued that the most equitable approach is for students to retain the agency to choose a letter grade or S/NC for each course.

The communications that I have found the most compelling have come from students who have overcome challenges after struggling academically during their first years at Brown, and whose grades this term would document their success. For these students, letter grades this semester ‚Äì even if only in one class ‚Äì could showcase their resilience in the face of adversity, and help them secure access to future opportunities. The hopes and concerns that these students have shared are very real, and they speak directly to how education can transform our lives and those of our communities. For these reasons, we have decided against a ‚Äúuniversal pass‚Äù or mandatory S/NC system.
 
I am thankful that ‚Äì at this moment of uncertainty ‚Äì equity and inclusion remain at the forefront of all our discussions, even if we may disagree on the right approach. My commitment in the days and weeks ahead is to ensure that you and your peers have the best support possible to make the best decisions for yourselves. Please reach out to college@brown.edu if you need support with this or other decisions.

I wish you all the best this week in reconnecting as a remote learning community, a community committed to creating, sharing, and applying knowledge in support of improving the world.

ConfidentPromise1,"I'm a freshman and I've been extremely depressed so far in college. It started off well enough, but I never fell into a friend group that everyone else seems to have. I have individual friends and acquaintances, but it all seems so superficial, and other people who I've wanted to hang out with have repeatedly turned me down (making excuses being busy). If I don't reach out to people, no one really asks me to hang out. I do go out on the weekends and party, but it still feels superficial, like it's ""not me"".

&#x200B;

I miss home more than I ever thought I would. I live all the way across the country, so going back isn't really an option ever. I miss my family, my two real friends from high school, my house, my room, everything, tremendously. The dorms feel cold and unfriendly, and my roommate and I have nothing in common and don't even talk anymore (we literally won't even acknowledge the other if one of us walks into the room). There isn't tension between us, but there's zero sense of friendship. However, I hate living with someone else. I have social anxiety and I feel like I NEVER get a chance to recharge. I'm always ""performing"" around other people, and there is no opportunity to truly be alone for a bit. It is eating away at me.

&#x200B;

Classes are ok, but CS15 is an absolutely ridiculous amount of work, and I find myself unmotivated and easily getting behind. The work ahead of me makes me feel sick to my stomach and gives me terrible anxiety.

&#x200B;

I started off happy enough the first couple weeks, but now I've been in a rut. My default mood in my day-to-day life is unhappy, and I feel like I've been depressed.

,"I'm currently a student at a mid-tier school. I have a 4.0 GPA, a great research position with a PI that's genuinely invested in my career, my professors and advisers all know me by name and have vowed to help me get into a great medical school and I have lots of friends that genuinely care about me. Perhaps most importantly, I will be graduating in 1.5 years with no debt.

But I'm still applying to transfer to Brown. I don't like being put on a pedestal by my peers and professors. I want to be surrounded by people that I know are smarter than me, more motivated than me, and will push me out of my comfort zone. I want to take art classes at RISD and do research in Public Policy while I'm getting my Biology degree. I want to fully explore my creative side before I start medical school. 

I put hours upon hours into my application getting my story on paper, editing my essays and filming my Video Portfolio. I know that I very likely won't get in, but I'm safe in the knowledge that I genuinely put my all into my application.

However, my parents, my professors and my advisers don't understand why I'm so invested in transferring. My parents aren't very supportive of this goal, because they're looking at the big picture (i.e. my attending medical school), which I understand completely; the logical thing to do would be to want to remain at my current school.

,"So I‚Äôve been refraining from posting for forever since I didn‚Äôt want to be annoying, so I just wrote them down in my notes. Oh boy here we go. 

1. Are rooms opened with physical keys or key cards?

2. Are the dorms cold? My mom is worried I‚Äôm going to be cold.

3. Do students at Brown ever visit other Ivy League schools? For like parties or anything? 

4. Does anyone else find the sweatshirts in the gift shop uncomfortable? I couldn‚Äôt find one that I liked. Is there a better way to get merch? Do students sometimes wear Brown merchandise?

5. How is Brown‚Äôs prelaw advisory? What year do students typically join?

6. Is there a startup culture around Brown in Providence? Is there funding for start ups? My friend who really wants to go to MIT always talks about how they‚Äôll fund your start up if it looks really promising (I think you have to win a competition).

7. Are there board game groups on campus? I assume there almost has to be. Any board game shops near Brown?

8. Do you have any advice for building a first year schedule?

9. I saw a post here about continuing to take a foreign language in college. I actually loved the open curriculum so much partially because I hate language learning. Maybe I‚Äôd change my mind later but I barely made it through high school Spanish. Is this really necessary?

10. Do you guys love tropical cafe smoothies as much as I do? Their peanut butter shake is amazing.

11. Does laundryview.com still work? It seems like a really cool idea. Any idea if a student made it? 

12. I sometimes wish I knew about awards that my high school gave out sooner. There were a few awards that I probably could‚Äôve gotten if I had known they existed. Are there notable awards that students strive for? Stuff that I‚Äôll miss out on if I don‚Äôt know about it? I realize this might not be in the brown spirit but I‚Äôd like to at least know about all my opportunities.

13. Any idea how I can best slide into an RPL position? Like, how do they decide who gets the role? It‚Äôs something I think I might want to do. 

14. What is the most fun or convenient work study? Anything I should maybe consider that I wouldn‚Äôt have normally?

15. On my tour I was told that there are people that hand out hot chocolate and lemonade on campus. How can I do this? 

16. Any idea what, if anything, is replacing Bluno? I really like Bluno...

17. Is it difficult to get into the improv groups on campus? I‚Äôve always wanted to try improv. Is it taken really seriously, or is it something I could just pop in and do every once in awhile?

18. Is the ham radio club active? This one‚Äôs a long shot, doubt anyone here is in it.

19. Any advice on how to get a TA role ? I love to teach and I‚Äôm considering being a professor someday, and I know I want to TA if given the chance, maybe in my junior year or something.

20. Have any of you requested to see your application and the notes that the AOs made? Is this possible at Brown? 

21. Are there any funny Brown websites? My friend who goes to Yale told me about the website there that tells them if the lunch is serving chicken tendies or not, even though they only serve them on Thursdays (so the website is basically: is it Thursday?). Does brown have anything similar? I hope so...

22. Does Brown Rank? My girlfriend is in college and her school ranks them, not just in the department but out of the whole class. I think I learned that there is no valedictorian, but is there any rank at all?

23. How difficult is it to get articles published into the Brown Political Review? Is this something a lot of students try to do? How difficult is it to work on it (editing for example)?

24. I am interested in concentrating in philosophy, and, while this may change, I was wondering if the department helped undergraduates to get published at all. I know this is rare and difficult but I was wondering if it is done. Any idea if there is a push for undergraduates to get published in journals? Or any way to get help if I am looking to?

25. Are the libraries/gym open 24/7?

26. Can I have a small fridge in my room? 

27. Do people hang out on the green a lot? Like just laying in the grass? I only got to tour in the summer and I didn‚Äôt see much of this. 

28. Can you ever have a car on campus? I‚Äôm definitely thinking that you can‚Äôt but it‚Äôs worth asking. 

29. Is birding club as awesome and simple as it sounds? Also, anyone here do the Petey Greene program? 

30. Are there any Brown traditions that I don‚Äôt know about? Like rubbing the foot of the statue at Yale, or complete silence during finals week at HMC, or something like that. I know about the not entering the gates except for the first time. I‚Äôve also heard of this thing called the naked donut run from this subreddit? Lol. Anything else I should know about?

timmymcbigweiner,"Hey everyone, I've seen a very common question from prospective students about the liberal nature of Brown. I think it's worth clarifying in its own thread. The most common form of this question I've seen is:

 ""Is Brown too liberal, and will I feel different for having political views that are different from the majority of campus?""

The answer to this question is no; very few people at Brown will treat you differently based on your political beliefs or lack thereof. In my experience, personal politics are generally saved for discussions in politically concerned clubs or among friends who are already similar.

As an example: I am on an athletic team, which has some of the most different people on campus in terms of personal demographics, and we encompasses probably the entire political spectrum. Nobody on this team disparages anyone for their politics. I came to Brown somewhat conservative thanks to my upbringing, and I feel completely free to hold on to that mindset or to rethink and be completely undecided. One of our seniors voted for Trump as president, and many of our upperclassmen are vocally anti-Trump. None of the upperclassmen hold their differences against each other personally, and nobody has made me feel bad about having weak or no political attachments.

This doesn't mean Brown is not politically active. We have walkouts, political groups, political articles in our newspaper, and stickers on our laptops just like most American universities. You can easily find a place to be politically active if you want to. As another example: My best friend and roommate for next year became the secretary of Browns NAACP chapter back in his first semester on campus. It's not hard to become involved.

I hope other students agree this is an accurate representation of politics at Brown, and I hope all prospective students have their question answered.

misterbasurahead,"I'm currently an incoming freshman in the class of 2024 and I'm struggling with the announcement that Brown made this morning. I completely understand why schools would prioritize bringing upperclassmen over freshmen back to campus (at least this fall), and I also understand that Brown is trying to provide a safe environment for everyone. However, I wish they would allow freshmen to begin online in the fall as well. I don't particularly understand the reasoning of not allowing online instruction for freshmen but still offering a free course. Obviously, if students are doing online learning at home, that completely bypasses any campus covid concerns. I really don't want to do a summer semester; I'd much rather do a fall semester online and go to campus in the spring or even do both semesters online in the fall and spring. For me, summer breaks are an opportunity to get important internships, do research, or anything else that might help further my career goals. It seems like a wasted opportunity when pretty much everything along that nature is shut down for the fall. Also, if freshmen are forced to do spring/summer semesters, where the finals for the summer semester are August 9-13, they would be doing the equivalent of four consecutive semesters in their first two years. This seems like a very toxic environment for mental health. Obviously, we are in the midst of a pandemic and many people have it much worse. Still, I think that it shouldn't be too much to be asking for the option to do online learning in the fall for incoming freshmen.

Just got accepted to Brown RD and I was so excited to commit until I got my financial aid package this morning. 

For some context, I‚Äôm an international student living in Manila, but I am an American citizen and I qualify for FAFSA. My family makes less that $100k/year and although we do have some assets, my impression based on research and past experiences of other lower income Brown admits is that my family would have received substantial financial aid.

We only received $12k/year making our total estimated cost over $70k/year. I almost cried when I saw this because I was so disheartened. I‚Äôm not sure if I can even afford to go to this school anymore. :(

Additional info: I filed my FAFSA late due to logistical errors with mailing parent signatures that were entirely out of my control due to the delays caused by COVID. Would this have affected why my award is so low?

Does anyone have any advice on how to appeal for more? My tuition at Brown would practically be the same amount as my family‚Äôs income in a year.

* One member of the Brown community has tested positive for COVID-19. Students and employees who were in contact with the diagnosed individual have been notified by the R.I. Department of Health, which provides guidance on health considerations and quarantine.

* Both the State of Rhode Island and the U.S. federal government have declared states of emergency, and R.I. Gov. Gina Raimondo has closed all public K-12 schools in the state for the week of March 16.

* Brown remains open, but the University is expediting the departure of students from campus and taking steps to limit the exposure of Brown employees to the virus.

* To protect the community while enabling students to complete the semester, Brown will move academic instruction for all undergraduate and graduate students to remote learning effective March 30.

* Undergraduate students who live in on-campus residences or Brown-owned properties must vacate their residences by March 17 and complete the semester from their homes or at an alternate location.

* Classes are cancelled for the week of March 16 so that faculty have time to prepare to transition courses to remote learning and students have time to pack and arrange for travel.

* All but the most essential events are cancelled. Admissions events and all spring athletics competitions and practices are cancelled, and non-essential visitors are discouraged from coming to campus (parents and families are considered essential visitors during the process of helping students move off campus). 

* Starting on March 16, only essential personnel should report to work in person. Brown remains open, and employees who can work remotely are expected to do so. Staff members assisting students as they move out of residence halls may be classified as essential personnel.

* Brown has suspended all University-sponsored travel to both international and domestic destinations.

* Per executive order in Rhode Island, anyone returning to the state after any international travel will be required to self-quarantine for at least 14 days upon arrival.
Brown has not yet determined whether Commencement and Reunion Weekend can proceed at its usual scheduled time in late May.

Unfortunately the past week has been a whirlwind for me and after a really bad 24 hour stomach bug, a couple days of ER and a bunch of scans, I found out that I most likely have Crohn‚Äôs disease. Although my case doesn‚Äôt look too severe, I definitely still want to prepared in case I do have any flare-ups or anything like that‚Äî especially if things go as bad as they have in the past week‚Äî and I think the best way to keep myself chill and prepared is to just be aware of Brown‚Äôs medical resources for students. Are there pharmacies nearby to pick up prescriptions? This sounds stupid, but is there anything sort of like a school nurse‚Äî there if you need it, but without the fuss of a whole doctor‚Äôs visit??

Bruno1771,"A few months back I made a post trying to detail the differences in frats at Brown to help people figure out where to rush. I've seen a lot of questions about how rush actually works and how to get a bid, so now I'll try to help out with that.

&#x200B;

Step 1: Getting on the list/in the door at the first event.

&#x200B;

\- This is honestly the hardest part for a lot of frats. They keep rush secretive and even though the event may be technically open, it likely isn't publicized very much (if at all). Lots of frats do have very public rush calendars though, so this doesn't apply to everywhere. Ideally, if you know a brother (even a little bit) from class/a club/meeting them at a party, just reach out and ask. Say you're interested in greek life and want to check out x organization, and you were wondering when the first event is. 99% of the time they will get your email and add you to the list. If you don't know a brother personally, ask your freshman friends where they are rushing and if they say the frat you're interested in, just ask if they know when the first event is. Again, 99% of the time they will either bring you to the event as a +1 (which is generally allowed) or text whoever got them on the list to get you on as well. It is possible that if you don't know anyone in a frat then you can have a very difficult time rushing, but generally it should be pretty easy to get your way on the list if you ask around enough.

&#x200B;

Step 2: How to handle events

&#x200B;

\- There's a huge range in the types of events during rush, so this is hard to generalize, but I'll do my best. This is going to sound cliche, but be yourself. There was a frat I didn't get a bid from that I rushed because I just didn't really gel with the brotherhood, and I was disappointed because initially it was my first choice. Looking back now, I'm very glad I'm not in that frat because its membership really does not reflect who I am. Rush is about finding a good match, not getting into the a house that you think is the best for whatever reason. 

&#x200B;

\- Have fun and unwind, but within reason. If you have a stick up your butt and treat rush like a professional networking event, brothers are going to find you dry and you probably won't get a bid. If you get blackout drunk, behaving like you're a 9th grader who has never drank alcohol before, and pass out in their bathroom, they won't give you a bid. There will probably be a lot of alcohol available and lots of drinking games (which can be a great way to meet bros) but don't be the kid who tries to impress everyone by getting absurdly drunk as it will only destroy your chances of getting a bid. 

&#x200B;

\- Find a balance between quantity and quality of conversations. If you talk to one brother the entire night, it'll be hard for that one person to back you up when it comes to voting on who to keep/cut (especially early in rush when frats have a ton of rushes and need to make lots of cuts). On the other hand, introducing yourself and then moving on won't accomplish anything as people are just gong to forget you or they won't vouch for you. Try to have good, memorable conversations, but know when to move on and make sure you get facetime with a good amount of brothers. Also, don't talk about how much you party or who many girls you get with- you aren't impressing anyone and it's just gonna make people cringe. Also, try to introduce yourself to the rush chair (ask any brother who you've been talking to who it is and they will often go introduce you if they like you). You probably won't be able to have a real conversation because they're going to be super busy, but just help them put a name to a face. 

&#x200B;

\- Typically after events, there will be unofficial 'breakout sessions' like smoking in a bros room or grabbing food or something. THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT. It separates you from the masses of other freshman and will make you way more memorable. Also, hanging out with a smaller group of brothers (like 3-5) helps a lot because it's just more people to vouch for you.

&#x200B;

Step 3: Between/After events. 

&#x200B;

\- Typically if a frat likes you, individual brothers who you've connected with will get your number and try to invite you to do stuff (grab a meal, hangout in their lounge, etc). ALWAYS DO THIS WHEN ASKED. Turning down brothers will piss them off and make you seem uninterested. Obviously it's understandable if you have class or something, but always reschedule to a time you can do.

&#x200B;

\- Most frats will have a bunch of parties during rush and invite rushes they like to pregame with them and go to the party. Again, if you're available, absolutely do this. That being said, make sure you behave at the party. They partially invited you so they can show off how much fun they have, but they're also watching how you behave when lots of alcohol and girls are present. Also, ideally you would show up to the party with a small group of other rushes who were invited. It's ok if a few girls come with you (but absolutely not a necessity), but be very careful bringing other guys who didn't rush or didn't get invited to the party. Tell them to come later or something, but they will absolutely take note if you show up at the door with 10 other guys who aren't rushing.

&#x200B;

\- If you get invited to a dinner (especially if they pay for you at a nicer off campus place), it means one of two things. They really like you and are trying to wine and dine you so you accept a bid (especially if they know you're rushing other places), or they are on the fence about whether or not they like you (maybe some bros endorsed you but one brought up a concern, or one bro really liked you but not enough people backed you up). Again, just be yourself and have a good time, and be super grateful for them taking you out to dinner, be polite, and try to get to know the guys you're at dinner with. Ask questions about being in the fraternity and be prepared to answer some questions about yourself.

&#x200B;

\- Reaching out to brothers yourself is a little more controversial and there are definitely mixed opinions on this one. Personally, I think it's a little off-putting when rushes (especially who I don't know that well) ask for my phone number and then text me to hang out or whatever, but it also does show interest. If you think you really bond with someone and they don't ask for your number it may be worth asking for theirs, but be careful about what you text them about. It's fine to ask them to go to lunch at the ratty or something (especially if its an older guy and you offer a meal swipe), but don't text them asking about a party or something like that.

&#x200B;

Thats about all my thoughts, feel free to ask any follow-up questions. I also checked out a few different places in rush and have friends in most frats, so I might be able to answer more frat-specific questions also.

college_throwawayyyy,"I'll preface this post by saying that I know that I am very fortunate to have been accepted to such selective schools. I understand that I am very privileged in my current position, but I am still experiencing some intense difficulty deciding between my current two top choices: Columbia and Brown.

Let me give some background for the situation I currently find myself in. Columbia has been my dream school for years. Ever since I first began thinking about where I might want to go to college, Columbia has been at the very top of my list. Columbia was the first school I ever visited, and I knew immediately that it was the place I wanted to end up. Taking all this into consideration, I applied ED in the Fall. I was deferred, and I was devastated. I let the college admissions process affect my own self-esteem far too much, and I spiraled into a bit of depression and anxiety that made it difficult me to do schoolwork or talk to my friends. I remember walking around my house, saying things like ""If I get into any school other than Columbia, I'll try to transfer after my freshman year."" I know all of the Columbia promotional material by heart and can recite it essentially verbatim. I hope this shows exactly how hard my heart was set on Columbia for so long.

So as you can imagine, I was ecstatic when I was fortunate enough to have been accepted to the class of 2021 during the regular decision round. I was also accepted to some other schools on March 30, including Brown. Up until this point, I had never visited Brown's campus, and I still had my heart set on Columbia, but I was pleasantly surprised to have the option.

Fast forward to Columbia's admitted students event: ""Days on Campus,"" which was held on April 9th and 10th. This was the first time that I had ever visited Columbia's campus while there were undergraduate students present--the other times I had always visited over the summer months. While all of the admissions officers and student volunteers seemed friendly, I felt as though the general student body held a general disdain for the prospies on campus. This belief of mine was confirmed by looking at Columbia's Yik Yak that day: several comments had been made along the lines of ""Prefrosh should jump off a roof"" and ""All these prefrosh are making me late to class."" Overall, I felt like I was not welcomed by most of students at Columbia, who made it abundantly clear that I was at the very bottom of the totem pole at a major institution with little regard for your individual troubles. I experienced some of what I had only read about before, and never quite understood: the bureaucracy of Columbia. After attending Columbia's Days on Campus, I feel like the word ""bureaucracy"" seems like a perfect fit for what the administration is like. Days on Campus seemed like a formality, accepting the next class of students into the whirring machine of advanced higher education that would spit out our generation's pushers and movers--but little else. Dean Valentini (who seems like a very nice man) gave a speech, as did the Dean of Admissions, Jessica Marinaccio. I felt that the staffers and organizers were doing the best they could, but it was difficult not to feel as though the entire event and the university as a whole was somewhat impersonal.

Beyond this, I wasn't entirely thrilled by the attitudes of some of the other prefrosh. Sure, there were plenty of nice people there, but there were also lots of students who seemed like they were just bragging about how they were trying to choose between Columbia and Harvard, but would probably just end up choosing Harvard. It seemed like a lot of the other people who attended the event went to private school (which isn't necessarily bad), but they brought with them a sense of prep school elitism that I had never really been exposed to before. There was an overwhelming sense of entitlement among many of the prospies that I was, quite frankly, appalled by. I have been fortunate enough in life to not experience hardship. I am thankful to have loving parents, teachers who care about me, and lots of friends who support me. Yet, despite my own privilege in life, I couldn't help but feel that many of the kids at Days on Campus were in a different stratosphere of wealth and were far more self-assured about their right to have a place at such an elite institution. Since being accepted to college, I have suffered to a certain extent from imposter syndrome, questioning whether I truly belong at such an amazing place. Yet, many of the prospies that I encountered at Columbia did not appear to feel similarly, and it honestly seemed like they had been afforded every blessing in life. I met kids who went to some prep schools, and had already mastered multivariable calculus and linear algebra before even entering college. As a prospective math major, I felt inferior to these students, when I myself had struggled through Calculus BC. It made me question whether I wouldn't be discouraged from attempting to pursue a math degree, because I was already so far behind many of the other students.

On top of all this, I got the overwhelming sense that the student population really was as stressed as people online reported. I heard several students comparing GPAs with each other, the general student did not seem overly happy. This actually reminded me of [a post from this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63mj5v/columbia_university_a_student_perspective/), which made a similar comment:

>When I see people walking around campus I don‚Äôt see much happiness or enthusiasm.

This comment seemed almost naive to me at first when I first read it a couple weeks ago. What do you honestly expect out of the student body of a top-ranked institution like Columbia? People there are serious about their studies and have a New York attitude--a certain sense of independence. Yet, looking around Columbia's campus a few weeks ago, I realized just how accurate this sentiment really is. People there certainly seemed ambitious--I overheard many a conversation about the latest internship or job offer. Yet, so few of the people I encountered seemed like they had the spark of passion in a subject that I had dreamed of. And still fewer seemed like they were actually enjoying themselves on such a beautiful April day. It reminded me of a comment I read on the Columbia subreddit a couple months ago, in response to someone who posted about recently being accepted: ""Get out while you still can.""

New York City, too was not what I had previously expected. I have been to New York a handful of times, always in awe of the buildings and culture there that is known the world over. However, on my most recent visit, I got the sense that I had never perceived before, of being entirely overwhelmed. I come from a very small town, where the pace is comparatively slow. Yet, when I found myself rushing to the subway so I could quickly get downtown to the hectic hellhole of Penn Station so I could get my train back home, I felt what I imagine is the hustle and bustle of a ""New York minute."" To be honest, I didn't like it. To me, it seemed as though I was more irritable than ever before. I felt like I had a disregard for other people as I pushed past them toward my final destination. Maybe it was only because I had drank a cup of coffee (something I don't often do), but I felt self-centered in a way that I was acutely aware of and did not necessarily enjoy. I had always assumed that I wanted to live in New York later in life, but I'm not certain such a stark transition would be good for me, and I'm very afraid that the climate of New York would only bring out the worst aspects of my personality, namely anxiety, stress, and a self-centered ego that makes me feel like I am the only important person in the world (I have certainly been guilty of this last one before).

Enter Brown. I attended their admitted students day this past week, A Day on College Hill (ADOCH for short). A Day on College Hill was literally the **best** three days of my entire life. It is the happiest I have ever been. All of the activities that they had us do were so much fun. From eating in the Ratty to going to the bookstore to check out all the cool merchandise to exploring Brown's beautiful campus, I absolutely loved it. I really cannot understate how much fun I had. I could really see myself on Brown's campus for the next four years. Brown had almost the exact opposite vibe of Columbia. My room hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful (not that my host at Columbia wasn't), and they went above and beyond to answer any questions I had. My host even took me to one of his classes, and told me about how his professor learned all of the student's names, even though it was a massive intro-level lecture. There was even an option to speak one-on-one with the admissions officer who had read your application. When I went to talk to the officer for my region, she was busy with another student, so I walked away. This lady was so nice that she e-mailed me the next day to meet up with me so that she could talk to me. She knew my name and the details of my entire application, and I felt really personally cared for. In addition, another senior admissions officer texted me personally and asked me if I had any questions and if I was enjoying my stay. When I was talking to that officer, she knew my name and exactly who I was, even though we had never spoken face-to-face before.

In addition, the students at Brown seemed incredibly friendly. One student stopped in the middle of his studying to ask if I had any questions or needed any help. He then walked with me outside to show me where I needed to go. Another student saw that I was confused when looking at a map and again offered to point me in the right direction. I felt welcome and cared for in a way that was 100% not the case at Columbia. The sense of elitism from Columbia was also not present on campus. All of the other prefrosh seemed genuinely interested in hearing each other's opinions and listening to what they were passionate about.

Many other students at ADOCH that were choosing between Columbia and Brown felt much the same way as I did. I spoke to two other people who both were choosing Brown over Columbia. One of these people goes to the high school in the county over from mine, and was almost as dead-set on Columbia as I was before attending ADOCH. Another girl I talked to seemed surprised when I said I was considering Columbia over Brown: ""But everyone is so laid-back and friendly here,"" she remarked, and I must admit she had a point. My host's roommate was also super chill, and honestly one of the coolest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet in my entire life. He said that a year ago, when he was deciding on a college, he was choosing between the University of Chicago (which, like Columbia is known for its stress culture and poor mental health) and Brown. He said he was so unbelievably happy he had chosen Brown, and that all of his friends were glad they did too.

In addition, I also was convinced of the effectiveness of the open curriculum at Brown, compared to Columbia's core. I had always been a fan of the Core curriculum, because it would give me the chance to learn about the great works that make up western civilization. I have always wanted to be well-versed in high culture, and attending Columbia would allow me to achieve this. I also have been enamoured with the Contemporary Civilizations and Literature Humanities courses, where I could learn about all the philosophy without having to take formal philosophy courses. I have always loved philosophy, and Columbia would offer me this sort of easy accessibility to great western works. While visiting Brown, however, I was convinced that the open curriculum is not without its own merits. I am not entirely certain that I want to pursue a degree in mathematics (I also have interests in stats, computer science, and economics--though I am wary of selling out to Wall Street). At Brown, I could perhaps pursue these interests to a greater degree, simply because I would have more time and freedom.

This all being said, there are a few problems I have with choosing Brown over Columbia.

I recognize that much of the reason why I am making this post is because I am still in love with Columbia. I have a massive issue with confirmation bias, and I am mostly making this post because I want someone to tell me that my fears are unfounded, and that I shouldn't focus so much on the intangible aspects of choosing a college. Instead, I should just be happy attending the school that has been the object of my dreams for years: ""the greatest university in the greatest city in the world.""

In addition, I am a little concerned that all of this worry over the choice of college is a manifestation of my own self-defeating tendencies. I am simply afraid that I won't be able to cut it at Columbia, and so I am filling myself with doubt so that I will attend Brown, where the students at the very least seem happy with their choice. There, I will still be challenged and have the smug superiority of having attended an ivy league university, but I will be in a more hospitable and accepting environment. This reflects one of the comments I heard at ADOCH this past week: ""Think about where you want to be when you are stressed out and need help. Brown provides a community... unlike some other schools."" This comment seemed specifically tailored to me.

Another problem is the sense of regret. If I attend Brown, I know I will regret not going to Columbia, which has been my dream for years. Instead of facing the stress of the big city and a major university, I know I will feel as though I simply avoided the issue instead of trying to deal with it (even though this feeling seems irrational and unfounded).

Prestige is another issue. Both these schools are ivies, so this literally doesn't matter, and I recognize this. Still, there's something that really just gets me deep down when I can say that I was accepted to the third most selective college in the nation. I get the same feeling when I think about saying to someone later in life, ""Oh, I went to school in New York"" or ""I had an ivy league education."" Something about being an ivy league new yorker makes you feel on top of the world and that's a difficult emotion to give up, even if it is irrational.

I am also wary of basing my entire decision off of three days of my life. Is the accepted students day really representative of what life in college is going to be like? I am so inexperienced and know so little about what it is truly like to be independent in college, that it is impossible for me to even tell. ADOCH was certainly fun, but is it worth changing my entire life trajectory over a single event? I don't think so, even now.

On a more concrete basis, I'm not entirely certain what to think about the pure math department at Brown. While Brown does have the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM), my host said that the professors in the pure math department for undergraduates were not the best. Instead, Brown has a very strong focus on applied math rather than pure math. That being said, I am not certain exactly which side of math I would like to pursue. Yet, I am afraid that I may be pushed closer to the applied side at Brown, simply because their applied department is stronger. In contrast, my childhood hero Brian Greene is a professor in the math department at Columbia. While I am under no illusion that I would be spending time with Dr. Greene, I still think it would be really awesome to attend the same college that he works at.

I am also very interested in getting involved with the radio station wherever I go to college. I absolutely love listening to NPR, and both Brown and Columbia have had alumni go to NPR (including Ira Glass and Robert Siegel, respectively). Yet, the future of Brown's radio station has recently been called into question, as they are considering selling it. Though it does not look like the motion to sell will pass, it is something I am considering, as Columbia's radio station seems to be just as strong if not stronger than Brown's.

In addition, I would like to join marching band in college, especially since it was one of the activities I most enjoyed during high school. Both the Brown and the Columbia bands are similar--they have a ""scramble"" format--but Columbia's band also does Orgo Night, a beloved night of comedy the evening before the Orgo Chem final. I am interested in writing comedy and feel like this might be a good outlet for me to explore that interest. Several members of the marching band at Columbia even live in a suite together. Perhaps this would bring me the sense of community that I so desperately desire at such a faceless institution.

To complicate matters, there's an element of this entire issue that I haven't even discussed yet. I also got into the University of Pennsylvania, and now I feel like I never gave it a fair shake in this entire process. After having visited both Penn and Columbia before, I had decided that given a choice between the two, I would choose Columbia. I was so confident in this decision that I did not even attend Penn's accepted students day, and with ten days remaining before I have to commit, it seems like there is little chance that I will be able to visit any of these schools before deciding. Yet, I cannot help but feel that since I seem to have misjudged both Columbia and Brown, could I not have done the same thing to Penn? It always seemed to me that the choice between Penn and Columbia was obvious--a choice merely between New York and Philly. Both excellent institutions with similar student bodies and similar goals, just different locations. Now, however, I have come to realize the importance of intangible aspects of universities at a time that seems almost too late. Would I have preferred the social aspect of Penn, as it is known as the social ivy? I might never know, and that is a difficult truth for me to face. I am used to having complete information when making a decision, but it appears that this simply is impossible in my current situation.

And now, let me arrive at the crux of the entire scenario I currently find myself in. The single greatest issue that is making this decision difficult for me. The main reason why I am using a throwaway account to make this post right now. I met this really cute girl while I was visiting Brown.

I realize that this is the single stupidest thing ever. But we really hit it off, and I can't help but think that it made my entire visit to Providence seem way better than it actually was. I don't want this to define where I go for the next four years, and I need to make sure that it won't. I have worked so hard for years, and I can't let this stupid crush change the way I live the rest of my fucking life.

So, please help me reddit. I have relied on this subreddit heavily in the past, and I need your guidance now more than ever. The agony of this decision is killing me. I would like to thank you if you made it to the end of this post, because I realize that I have rambled on for quite a bit longer than I was originally expecting. But, I felt it was important for me to parse all of my thoughts out, and it seems only fair to give you the entire background of my story.

* Meal plan upon return

* Course selection upon return

* Status as a student at Brown, broadly

* Losing mailbox/leaving a forwarding address

* Access to internal Brown websites?  

* E-mail: Which Listservs/mailing lists are we removed from?  Will my e-mail account be deactivated after some period of time?

----------------------------

(Long post ahead, sorry!)

So, let me start out by saying that I took the past year off from Brown on a medical leave for psychological health and that I've been really happy with my decision overall.

While I've looked forward to returning to Brown during my time off, it's always been a distant thought, something abstract in the future.  Now that I'm getting ready to return--readmission forms were due this past Wednesday and decisions will come out in the first week of June--shit's suddenly gotten real.  Which is mostly a good thing.  But it's also made me reflect on the whole psychological leave process and how frustrating it's been at times.

I'll just say it: **I've felt disrespected, dismissed, and generally neglected by the Brown administration over the past year.**  I don't want to sound like an entitled brat, and I'm not telling Brown officials how to do their job or anything like that; I'm just expressing how I feel.  

Let me point out that aside from this experience, I've been really happy and grateful for the level of personalized care and devotion the school shows its students. **Especially for an institution of its size, Brown is impressively accommodating.  But this all seems to go out the window if you happen to be a student on psychological leave.**

From what I can tell, my experience was far from atypical.  This **[BDH column](http://www.browndailyherald.com/2012/09/19/newlon-145-a-pattern-of-prejudice/)** emphasizes the lack of flexibility of the policy, among other things.  This **[post- article](http://post.browndailyherald.com/2010/03/20/banished-from-brown/)** helps illustrate the helplessness we may feel when a dean decides what's best for us without listening to us.  

I mean of course the deans have the responsibility of looking out for the safety of the Brown community, and if they feel that an individual could pose a threat to himself or others, their opinion should take precedent over that individual's.  But psychological health is such a murky, complicated issue that a decision like this deserves a high level of consideration on everyone's part: at minimum, the student's and the administration's.  (In most cases, the student's family and friends and therapist and so many others are relevant.)  The whole thing should be very personal, evaluated carefully on a case-by-case basis because no two situations are the same.  The administrators don't seem interested in putting much thought into it, nor do they seem genuinely interested in a student's own thoughts, even though it's ostensibly the student's decision in the end.  Personally, I had fantasized about taking a leave *many* times in the past and was actually pretty relieved when it was suggested by someone else... but it was still an intimidating prospect (that's why I hadn't pursued it in the first place) and I felt that my questions and concerns were consistently dismissed by the administration, even after I had committed to the leave.  Not to get too personal but there was also an occasion on which a certain office was egregiously disrespectful to my immediate family, acting insensitively to an unrelated family tragedy.  :/

I was able to shrug all that off; after all, taking time off was obviously the right choice for me, and that's what matters.  **But what really got to me wasn't my dealings with the administration, it was the opposite.  It was the radio silence over the next year.**  This **[BDH article](http://www.browndailyherald.com/2010/09/27/psychological-leavetakers-miss-u-contact/)** discusses the complete lack of information available (*""University policies for medical leave ... are not currently available on the Office of Student Life's website""*) and the stunning lack of communication throughout the leave.  After my handful of meetings with deans in which I was effectively ignored, I filled out some paperwork in the OSL and got a copy of it, then I got a letter in the mail with **[the same papers](http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/Office_of_Student_Life/forms/med_leave/2013%20Readmission%20Guidelines%20\(Psychological%20Clearance\).pdf)**, which must be the only documentation that exists.  Just about a year later, a week before the readmission forms were due, they sent a reminder about that.

**Okay, I know Brown isn't my mom, and it's not their job to hold my hand and check in on me constantly.**  And I know that I could have been proactive about contacting the university; I did on one occasion ask a question about the readmission process and they got back to me promptly.  And again, maybe I'm being a whiny entitled brat, but I think Brown could have been a *lot* more helpful about all this.  About keeping me informed about the logistics of the whole thing: all the little details and things I should know and wouldn't necessarily think of on my own.  For example, I went to Brown for a visit in October and went to the mailroom; I had accidentally sent some stuff from Amazon to my Brown address.  Oops, just kidding, turns out I don't have a mailbox anymore!  Thanks for telling me, Brown!  Fortunately, some mailroom dudes were super helpful and spent forever tracking down my packages and didn't mind when my response to, ""Did you leave a forwarding address?"" was a blank stare.  

There are lots of little ""how should I have known about that?"" things like that... like how I had to track down my W2 from Brown to do my taxes, and how my Brown login was expired, and so on.  Similarly, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do about housing or signing up for classes or meal plans or whatever other stuff you have to think about when you're getting ready for another semester.  I'm not on the current student distribution lists; I don't get the morning mail or anything.  Again, yes, I can take the initiative to contact the school about all those things.  I'm just starting to do that now.  **But I think that it's reasonable of me to expect Brown to make it a *little* bit easy for me.**  Just a little bit.  I mean, they do that for current students, right?  Why do they expect so much more of me?  Why do they expect me, someone who's *taking time off* because I need to be *away from Brown*, to be constantly in touch about what I'm supposed to do to get my shit lined up for next year?  Especially when I won't even know until June whether I'm sufficiently ""recovered"" to return in the first place?  Ugh.

I dunno.  Brown treats its students great overall, but they could use a lot of improvement in this area.  I'd never felt like this before, like Brown just *didn't give a fuck* about me or my well-being... so that's why it's so surprising to me and why I just wrote a goddamn thesis-length essay about it.  And as you can tell from the articles I linked, **people have complained about this stuff before, and it doesn't seem to be getting better.**

Thanks for bearing with me, if you actually read all the way through this.  Either way, **I'm interested in other people's experiences**, whether they took psychological leave or medical or personal or mandated or whatever.

I have been considering taking a gap year both because I would like to make some more money to lower the amount of loans I'll have to take out, and due to uncertainties about COVID-19.

It's not absolutely terrible ($38,450.00 family contribution per year) but since the BRDD program is five years, the money adds up pretty quickly to >180k even after work-study. I'm worried about depleting my parents' savings, and future tuition for my sister, who is five years younger than me. If I had just gotten into Brown, I probably wouldn't even be considering this award, but I can't help thinking that I'll regret it for the rest of my life if I don't take this opportunity for BRDD.

Besides Brown and RISD, I was also accepted to: University of Georgia (safety) Georgia Tech (Industrial Design) Carnegie Mellon (Industrial Design)

Aid awards for these schools haven't come out yet for these schools, but since I'm in-state for GT, I know that my tuition will be around or less than 14k/year. I didn't apply to any ivies that didn't offer ID so I don't have any financial aid awards from those schools to appeal :'( Should I still appeal for a better award? Would the Brown financial aid office even consider offers from GT and Carnegie Mellon? (I'm not looking for them to match an offer from GT, but to possibly increase my aid award..)

mitokon,"Hi folks - 

Are you contemplating anything STEM/life sciences/pre-med?  Do you \*not\* already have a strong chemistry background (i.e. took AP/IB regardless of how you actually did on the exam)?  We offer a class called Chem 0100 for folks who didn't have much in the way of chemistry in HS.  It's mandatory S/NC and offered all online with pre-recorded materials and live conferences at a couple different times to make sure that you can connect from wherever you are.  The key reason you might consider this as your one fall online class is that you could then take Chem 0330 (""Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure"") in the spring and Chem 0350 (Organic Chem 1) in the summer, and then have a LOT of flexibility going forward in terms of the order in which you take classes.  We have built a lot of redundancy into this year to make sure people can take what they need to take when they need to take it.  If you can already rock the placement test well enough to do Chem 0330 right away, awesome: 330 fall or spring and then 350 in spring or summer is a good plan.  But if you *weren't* able to do Chem 0330 right away, Chem 0100 is for you.  If you have any questions about it, lemme know!

Imightnotworkthere,"I'm currently a junior in high school and I'm trying to decide on a school.  Brown has always been a dream school for me and I love the idea of an open curriculum.  I'm really interested in Product Design (using Data to build applications) but using Graphic Design and User Interface design to build digital products.  This is where I see the ideal combination of Brown's CompSci and RISD's Graphic Design (Computation, Technology + Culture focus).

There is a wrinkle to all of this.  I'm being recruited to play football at a few Power 5 schools and before Covid-19 I did take a few visits to these schools.   I have not been offered an athletic scholarship yet. 

A few questions.

1.  Is balancing athletics at Brown, CompSci, and RISD courses next to impossible?  I have heard that the Dual Degree Program is difficult.

2.  Should I just ditch RISD altogether and just use Open Curriculum to cherry pick the right courses (like Cross Registering for select RISD courses)?

I‚Äôm the type of person who craves interaction but is also pretty introverted, so I have a hard time being social. I‚Äôm kinda worried I‚Äôm gonna make a bad first impression, because it takes time for me to be able to open up to people, and even then I still have social anxiety. I had very few friends in high school, but a fair number of superficial acquaintances. So I‚Äôm also kind of dreading having a roommate, as well as the implications of all this on my social life.

I also don‚Äôt really have any real passions or real goals for whatever my career ends up being. I feel like I‚Äôm picking my major (CS) for the money, but I have nothing I really love academically (though STEM definitely is my field of interest.

joshashton413,"Hi everyone.

I am a rising sophomore at Northwestern and I have been thinking about potentially transferring my junior year, and potentially to Brown. I just want to make sure I am not getting the wrong impression of this school.

I am a questbridge scholar (which is probably bad for transferring yikes) but, I ranked Northwestern 1st, and Brown 2nd on my application. My decision really came down to me liking Chicago better than Providence even though I knew Brown was probably a better match personality-wise.

I like Northwestern. I love Chicago. But I feel so stuck here. As a low-income student, I feel like I have no support from admin and have felt behind since before classes even started. The student body is so discouraging, everything is so pre-professional, and every EC for people seems to be just another thing to add on to your resume. I came from a public high school in the 49th least funded state in education, and when I thought about attending a top university, I was hoping my peers would inspire me. But they do not. Nobody here seems to want to learn anything. Students seem to only care about their career. For the most part, people are extremely careless. People are not as collaborative as I had hoped. It is obvious that there is so much midwestern privilege here and it has been really frustrating dealing with it because people just want to make money more than anything. I just don't think I can be successful here. 

I just want to know if I would even get a different experience at Brown, and if it is even worth applying to. I would likely be Pre-med in Environmental Science if that helps.

Although my tuition the first year is pretty much the same at both schools, I don't know if this will change for the next 3 years and how much this should influence my decision.

babygoestocollege,"I sort of need somewhere to vent, and I figured that this might be a good place to do it.   


Firstly, I love Brown so much--it is my dream school by miles and I have wanted to go since I was a young child. From its institutional quirks and highlights (being the first school to accept students regardless of religious affiliation to having the first Black president of an Ivy League school) to its badass academic philosophy, I have always loved Brown from afar, and now that I am a rising Senior in HS, my anxiety about admission is mounting. 

&#x200B;

Not really asking for anyone to chance me (believe me, I tried to communicate with the imbeciles on r/chanceme, which didn't work too well) because I know that I will be a decent applicant and the rest will be up to honest chance. Anyway, the second semester just ended and my GPA and class rank dropped. I've been experiencing a severe disconnection with school this year, and I have no idea how to remedy it. I need to get an idea real quick because it's starting to affect my grades. I find that plain worry is pervasive in my daily life, all over an email I'll receive in mid-December (applying ED). Feels bad. 

&#x200B;

I also genuinely do not know how to communicate any of what I have just said in a way that will appeal/make sense to admissions officers. How do I make them feel my love for the school? How do I explain that in one year, my mother got  hospitalized, TWO of my friends' dads died, one of my closest friends got institutionalized, and I started a new migraine medication that made my brain a bit fucky!? lol. I'm worried that my performance in this most critical year will give them the wrong idea about the kind of person I am.

ettuyeezus,"Hey y'all! A pretty common sentiment seems to be that there's no place to go for conservative or non-partisan political discussion on campus, and I just wanted to make some of the spaces that do actively promote that dialogue more visible. 


I doubt this needs to be said, but just in case -- I don't think there's anywhere on campus where overt racism, sexism, homophobia, etc., whether joking or serious, would be tolerated.  Most of these clubs are working to bring thoughtful conservative voices to the student body, and letting bigotry exist freely in their organization would be pretty bad for their credibility.

[**No Labels**](https://www.facebook.com/NoLabelsBrown/) | Its specific goal is to promote nonpartisanship and open debate, I think mostly in a domestic context but I could be wrong about that. I'm not sure it's national, but it's really strong on campus. They some times bring in speakers, and often host club viewing parties for various political events.

[**The Alexander Hamilton Society**](https://www.facebook.com/Alexander-Hamilton-Society-Brown-University-292287190800305/) | A student group whose primary focus is brining conservative leaning speakers on to campus to debate with the university's professors; the intent is to promote ideological diversity on campuses nationwide, in the most transparent way possible. They focus exclusively on foreign policy issues.

[**The Political Theory Project**](https://www.brown.edu/academics/political-theory-project/home) | Again, this is focused more on ideological diversity than on strictly conservative thought. But, in being the counterpoint to an aggressively liberal mainstream, that means that it necessarily brings in mostly conservative or libertarian speakers. It's not a student group so much as a university-sponsored initiative, but there are different facets of the project that students can get involved in if that's what floats your boat.

[**The Brown Political Forum**](https://www.brown.edu/academics/political-theory-project/brown-political-forum) | Another group, I think actually an extension of the Political Theory Project, that aims to bring conservative voices onto the Brown campus. To quote them directly, ""Here at the Brown Political Forum (BPF), we understand that one of the only ways to fix the state of politics on this campus and perhaps in the political sphere at large is by engaging across difference. We want to learn how to challenge the ideas of others and accept challenges to our own ideas.""


[**The Brown Political Review**](http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/) | This is arguably one of the most prestigious, and definitely one of the most well-known, organizations that publishes *for* the student body. It's genuinely nonpartisan, and regularly prints editorials from all areas of the political compass, as well as political-but-not-partisan content. If you want to get your views out for the entire student body to read, it's definitely the third best place for that. After Brown Bears Admirers and Brown Bears Confessions. It has its own Wikipedia page!

[**Republican Club of Brown University**](https://www.facebook.com/BrownRepublicans/) | It exists! I promise! :)

**Sigma Chi** | Okay so this is a frat lmao. But they really, *really* put brotherhood over any political leanings, long as you can hold your own in a snappa tournament. I feel kind of silly putting it on a list with politically-minded clubs, but if you're just looking for somewhere with a frattier atmosphere and not for intentional political conversation this is a pretty good place to be. No one's going to harass or ostracize you for your viewpoints unless you're shitty about it, and that's universal no matter how you lean.

**Et cetera** |  [You can browse other clubs and their mission statements here.](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/events/student-activities/sites/brown.edu.campus-life.events.student-activities/files/uploads/Active%20Club%20Public%20List.pdf) Most of the CS/Engineering pre-professional societies straight up have nothing to do with politics, and would probably not appreciate *anyone* being vocal about their leanings, and I imagine the pre-law and consulting groups are the same. DUGS (Department Undergraduate Groups) tend to lean the same way most of their students do, and if you're in a STEM concentration track chances are your experience will be pretty apolitical. That being said, Establishment Conservatism‚Ñ¢ is generally more supported, even in those circles, than populist or alt-right beliefs. Hope this helps!

1. If you are not into partying, does your social life suffer as a result?

2. How dominant is the party scene? 

3. If you do not want to party, will your Fridays and weekends be very dry/boring?

Senju_clan_marauder,"Hey guys,

I am a rising senior so I am in the midst of the college application season. Previously I was torn on whether I would REA Stanford, ED Duke, or ED Brown. However, now I am currently leaning towards ED Brown. 

&#x200B;

My reasons are that I have better chances of getting in, I like that there are no gen-ed reqs (open curriculum), I can probably take all of my premed courses and major in something else no problem, chill vibe to students (not cutthroat), and I can have ED to PLME BS/MD program.

&#x200B;

I was just wondering, **what are the downsides to Brown?**

I will be pre-med so I want my college to have plenty of shadowing, volunteering, and research opportunities. I currently do biochem research so will I have an advantage in selection for research? Are opportunities at Brown plentiful?

Is Providence boring? I come from the Raleigh area of NC which has a metro population of 1 million so will it be a shift? What is the vibe of the city?

Is there anything bad about campus? I am unable to tour right now because I have research work every day. My dad has a business trip to Boston coming up so he will be making a trip down to Providence and will video call me during the tour. The campus itself isn't that big of a consideration for me as long as the dorms are decent and campus is clean/ not crammed. The only campus I had a dislike for was Columbia because it was so tiny and cramped even though it was clean/aesthetic.

I have never lived in the US NE (I'm from US South) but since Providence is on the coast will winter weather be as bad as places more inland like upstate NY? I don't appreciate the cold but if there is snow then I don't mind. In NC, winters are cold with no snow so its a bad combo.

true_neutral25,"Hi everyone,

I got into Brown and Dartmouth and am having a lot of trouble deciding between the two. I'm leaning towards Brown but I really loved Dartmouth too. I was hoping that you guys could give me some more insight into your experience at Brown so that I can make the most informed decision. I applied as envi-sci but I'm mostly undecided, and the arts scene is very important to me (especially visual arts).

Questions:

* I know Greek life is a huge thing at Dartmouth... How big is Greek life at Brown? What do most people do to socialize?
* I'm not a very self-directed person, and I'm worried the Open Curriculum might be kind of dangerous for me. What kind of student is best suited for the Open Curriculum, if there is one? What has your experience with the Open Curriculum been like, and what should I do to ensure that I make the most of it?
* What are some of the things you think make living in Providence better/worse than living in Hanover?
* How much access do Brown students really have to RISD? I want to take some classes there, but is there as strong a connection between the schools as Brown says? Also arts at Brown in general?
* General thoughts on Brown over Dartmouth?

Thanks in advance!

Anxious-Lake,"Hi, I'm a '24 choosing between the two schools in title. I am a super indecisive person and literally (literally!) have no idea which one I prefer. Thoughts? 

If it helps -- I'm going in as a pure math major and likely pre-MD/PhD. If I go to Brown, I would likely double major in bio/math. I thrive on challenge and being with people who do, but I'm trying to balance that w/ pre-med requirements. 

I'm quite social/extroverted and enjoy parties now and then, but I don't plan to drink much (and hope to be at a school where that's okay). I'm a pretty driven/focused person, and I like to be around people who are similar in that way (but collaborative more than competitive). I think ""social nerd"" describes me pretty well, though I'm not super nerdy.

MIT -- **Pros:** What drew me here is the fact that everyone is super driven and wants to make a difference, and research is great. I've made a bunch of friends already and feel like I would fit in very well with the community. I love the idea of having pset parties late into the night on whiteboards and talking about random cool math problems, even if they aren't related to class. **Cons:** I'm worried about the workload, sleep, and mental health, especially since I won't be able to place out of any classes there. I also don't know how much time I'd have for extracurriculars.

Brown -- **Pros:** I love the open curriculum. There isn't grade deflation so pre-med might be easier. It also seems like it would be less stressful than MIT, and I could test into higher-level courses. The people seem quite humble and very friendly. **Cons:** I'm worried that I might not find ""my people"" in the same way/the community might not be as good of a fit. At my current HS, I've sometimes felt like it was hard to connect with classmates bc they had very different interests than me. I'm pretty clear this wouldn't be an issue at MIT, not convinced about Brown. I also don't know how strong the pure math program is/what research is like.

I took 3 years of biology in HS (natural sciences oriented curriculum), but since my school isn't international (nor in the US), the curriculum just covers different topics.

Theoretically, you can't enroll in BIOL 0200 (the class I placed out of) if you passed the placement test, but I'm sure the professor would let me if I make my case.

Bunnydict,"#Update: Pre-frosh got it on May 20! Check your @brown.edu inbox dudes & dudettes!

The email goes:

Dear Current and New Brown Students:

I hope you are all doing well as you finish the semester or, in the case of members of our new Class of 2024, complete high school. Everyone at Brown is eager to see you on College Hill.

To our graduating seniors, congratulations on being so close to getting your degrees! I am looking forward to the Virtual Degree Conferral ceremony on May 24. None of us expected that we would be apart for this important moment marking your achievements at Brown, but we already are planning ahead for the time we can be together again to cheer on the Class of 2020 for the celebration of Commencement. 

While I hoped that the state of the pandemic would allow us to celebrate in October, we have made the decision to host a double Commencement in May 2021, for the Classes of 2020 and 2021. Based on the latest health information and expert guidance, we think it is likely that large gatherings still will not be possible early in the fall. Our graduating seniors will have the opportunity to celebrate their Commencement and their first Reunion at the same time.

Planning for the Fall Resumption of Classes

As national conversations continue about the uncertain trajectory of the novel coronavirus pandemic, and what it means for colleges like Brown that offer residential experiences, I want to provide an update on planning for the reopening of the Brown campus. As I have shared previously, Brown‚Äôs plans are based on two foundational principles: (1) first and foremost, to protect the health of our students and employees to the best extent possible, and (2) to provide all of our students with an excellent academic experience.

The mode of how we deliver the educational experience at Brown next year may very likely look different than in past years, but I want to provide the assurance that how we conduct the year will be based on the best expert advice for safeguarding the health of our community and maintaining Brown‚Äôs high standards of teaching and learning. 

We are planning for a range of different scenarios for the coming year, including variations of the following:

A scenario in which we are able to follow our normal academic calendar, welcoming all students back to campus in the fall. (We know that this is optimistic, and it‚Äôs largely dependent on the progress in testing and treatment I have noted below.)
A scenario in which the University offers three semesters of instruction next year and arranges for students to be on campus for two of these semesters, thus providing an environment with  fewer students on campus at any one time.
A scenario in which health conditions are such that the fall semester has to be conducted remotely, with a decision about the spring to be made in the middle of the fall semester.
There could be various modifications under any on-campus scenario ‚Äî reduction in class sizes, hybrid online and in-person learning with livestreamed lectures and smaller group discussion sessions, etc. ‚Äî depending on containment of the novel coronavirus. In addition, even for an on-campus scenario, we‚Äôre planning for delivering education remotely for students who are unable to return to campus because of travel restrictions or health conditions.

I plan to make a decision about Brown‚Äôs planned approach no later than July 15. There will be decisions about various academic programs that we have to make sooner, based on factors that include ongoing limitations to international travel (affecting study abroad, for instance), and program schedules that require early decisions for on-campus activities that usually take place during the late summer. These decisions will be announced as they are made. 

I understand that many of you are eager to know what next year will bring, and I would like nothing better than to give you definitive information sooner. However, there is still so much we don‚Äôt know about the course of the pandemic. In the coming months, we will learn how health conditions evolve as the U.S. economy begins to reopen, and how quickly innovations in testing, contact tracing and treatment occur. By waiting, we will be able to weigh these factors to make a better and more fully informed decision, which is in the best interest of the health of our community. I appreciate your patience.

On Sunday, May 17, we will send new and continuing students a survey to get your thoughts about the choices you would most likely make under each of the scenarios currently under consideration. This confidential survey will be used solely to guide and refine our plans. Your answers will not commit you to making future choices. 

I strongly encourage you to take the survey. Your input is essential for helping us plan for an academic year that best meets the interests of Brown students. Following the conclusion of the survey, we will host virtual town halls for continuing and new students to share updates on planning. More details will be shared in the coming weeks.

I want nothing more than to see all of you in person and on campus, as soon as is safely possible. Although the course of the pandemic is beyond our control, we are working as hard as we can to make that a reality. In the meantime, I hope that you and your loved ones stay healthy and well in the weeks and months ahead.

Sincerely,

Christina H. Paxson

squareice,"Hi all,

  
Right now I'm trying to decide between studying CS at Brown and at USC. At USC, I'd get the presidential scholarship which would give me honors housing with the other scholarship students. That would be a nice little community of really bright students, that I think would be like a mini-version of what I'd experience at Brown. I guess the difference is that at Brown, almost everyone I meet will be  brilliant and interesting? (not sure how accurate this is, would appreciate info on the Brown student body, especially CS majors!).

&#x200B;

The reasons Brown is attractive right now is mostly the open curriculum. I have tons of interests outside CS (namely econ, philosophy, history, policy, art/design, english) and I think the ability to jump into advanced classes and have the option to take them pass/fail would be great. 

&#x200B;

My one concern about Brown CS is that with the recent explosion in popularity of the major at Brown, there are tons of CS majors and a limited amount of research positions / other resources? I'd really appreciate if anyone could shed some light on this -- does it ever feel like there is competition for classes or research positions or even just professors' time? I think at USC, CS majors is a smaller portion of the school (5% compared to \~17% at Brown), and I'd probably get additional special treatment bc of my scholarship.

needgraduatecsadvice,"Hello Brown Computer Science community! I've been recently admitted to both Brown and UC Davis for a PhD in computer science. This is a really hard decision for me as I'm trying to gauge what I care about while also trying to gather as much information as I can. Some things I'm interested in pursuing:

**Ultimate goal:** Be a research lead as cross section of machine learning and biomedicine -- personalized medicine in biotech.

**Research interests include:** ML for healthcare, quantifying uncertainty in clinical settings, ML de novo drug design, and genomic medicine, random processes.

Some things I'm gauging for both schools that I find important and some notes I've gathered from attending both open houses:

1. **Location** (warm/urban/close to tech hub)  

   1. Davis: Warm, suburban spot, but relatively close to silicon valley. lots of nature -- big plus.
   2. Brown: Cold AF which is somewhat depressing, urban but Providence is a little boring. close to Boston, which is cool.
2. **Faculty strength in Machine learning**  

   1. Davis: seems like most of their faculty is visualization/algorithms and they have a handful of ML folks. still not as impressed on this end.
   2. Brown: Lots of faculty with hubs in robotics, pure machine learning, interdisciplinary areas of ML
3. **Ease to combine CS work with statistics**  

   1. Davis: Not totally sure here, I can double major but its a whole other shabang
   2. Brown: Open graduate program allows people to apply and receive funding -- big plus
4. **Diversity of curriculum**  

   1. Davis: seems like they have just introductory courses in ML
   2. Brown: a lot more diversity in coursework (RL, vision, computational courses applied to bio)
5. **Research alignment with Advisor**  

   1. both Davis and Brown advisor seem to be well-aligned with research interests. Davis advisor is more bioinformatics oriented while Brown advisor is more high level ML for healthcare
6. **CS culture (students/ professors collaborative/ not assholes)**  

   1. Davis: lots of friendly students, but they dont seem to hang out much
   2. Brown: surprisingly super friendy and collegiate
7. **Ability to maintain current relationship**  

   1. Davis: If I stayed here I would probably get married to my gf, own a house -- big big decision here. she just started medical school at davis and does not intend to move
   2. Brown: I would most likely not maintain relationship
8. **Funding (traumatized from undergrad student loans lol):**  

   1. Davis: full funding but not the best stipend. lots of TA/reading/gsr for funding
   2. Brown: better funding than Davis (around 1k more), equipment funding (1.5k), transition stipend (1.5k). 

So at the end of the day, these are 8 things I really care about. But I dont know if I'm missing anything else to consider for Brown. My relationship is really weighing on me too. We've been together for 3 years and it feels like I'll lose this if I leave for Brown. Meanwhile if I stay, we'll be able to live together -- maybe even get married. But I don't know if I'll regret not going to Brown because I won't feel academically fulfilled at Davis -- which is why it'd be super helpful to get some input on this school -- **what is your experience with CS grad/undergrad classes? Is it worth going to Brown over Davis? Would you do it again? If you know anything about Davis -- what would you say about it? How about ML @ Brown? Do classes go very deep or are they mostly introductory? Do you feel like the department is excelling at teaching and passionate about what they do? Do you feel like you are being challenged and engaged academically? Do you feel like your peers are friendly/intelligent/ambitious?**

uniqlogirl,"I am a junior in high school and am really interested in the dual degree program RISD and Brown has. However, I *just* seriously considered the program; before this, I only planned on applying for RISD. My SAT scores are below average (1310-1350) but my GPA is above 4.0 weighted. I have not taken the ACT yet, but definitely will. If this helps, I've been in a leadership program since middle school which involves robotics and tech competitions, participating in Exploravision, Synopsis Science Fair, presenting at booths in Maker fair, design thinking projects, with a strong emphasis in soft skills and teamwork. I have won awards in robotics and Exploravision. Without too much elaboration, I've dealt with severe self esteem issues and bad mental health, but have learned to accept myself for who I am in the past, present, and future. Those are probably the best things going for me. 

How can I improve my chances of getting in the dual program/Brown? Also, if anyone knows more about experiences in the dual program and application process too, advice would be greatly appreciated.

ohgodballseverywhere,"the *SKINNY*

So I work at Brown but I'm a little removed from the community, not being an undergrad. I've been seeing these articles in the BDH but they're a little vague about stuff, and they've also naturally gotta be kind of objective and less accusatory.

From an outsider's perspective, just from my knowledge of the articles, I think the guy should definitely hang if he's found guilty. But from what the articles have said, it also seems totally possible that they were just utterly plastered, which of course doesn't mean everything is okay now, but also has a very different connotation. But then again, I'm really just going off of what I've read in the BDH articles.

What are some things the articles aren't telling us?

How likely is the influence of the accused kid's dad on the decision?

What do you think happened?

Also, in today's (3/6) issue, there are two articles, and the one with the tag ""ASSAULT"" says ""The alleged assailant, who is unaffiliated with Phi Kappa Psi, ..."", whereas the article with the tag ""GHB"" says ""Charges against the Phi Kappa Psi member who was accused of...""

burningham17,"Let's hear your opinions and suggestions for the various food trucks that I have been popping up everywhere.

Personally, I think Mama Kim's has gone downhill in quality in the past couple of months.  The bulgogi in particular has gotten a lot worse.  I think this has to do with their expansion and the original people no longer working on the Brown campus truck.

As a result of this, Mijo's has become my new favorite truck.  The guy is super chill and nothing makes a better midnight snack than the tacos with some super hot sauce.

I tried Plouf Plouf for the first time the other day and it was definitely delicious, but I don't think if it was worth the money.  I am really curious if they will survive with their current pricing structure.  The guy worked in a 3 star Michelin restaurant in France, which is pretty nuts.

Rocket's food just never really appealed to me, but I should give them a try I suppose.  Munchie's is pretty awesome (surprisingly good falafel), but is rarely here.  And, I don't like cheese, so Fancheezical is not for me.

*Intended major:* Biology, but I want the freedom to take political science courses and perhaps minor in that.

*Future plans:* I'm currently planning on applying to medical school, but that could absolutely change and I'm in no way committed to that. Based on that I might change my major after starting.

**Brown University**

*Pros:*

* Class sizes are small (good connections)
* Not too far from where I currently live (about 4 hours), and very close to Boston
* Excellent alumni network and the ""Ivy"" prestige 
* The academic freedom to explore my interests, and then some; with lots of courses
*  More opportunities to get involved with research. At Toronto it's rare for first- or second-years to be involved in research. 
* I've heard that academics are not as cutthroat here as Toronto, though of course still rigorous

*Cons:*

* *Cost -* $71K USD/yr, BUT I've appealed and I think they will match Swarthmore at $60K. I would then be responsible for $20K per year of that. Still, this is a huge disadvantage - is it worth it? 
* Technically ranked lower than Toronto in USNWR global rankings

**University of Toronto St. George (Trinity College)**

*Pros:*

* Cost - $20K/yr. Cheapest option.
* Awesome city with lots of opportunities
* Extended family near Toronto
* Highly ranked (though I'm unsure about the ""prestige""), higher than Brown 

*Cons:*

* Student life is significantly diminished because it is largely a commuter university (I will be staying on campus)
* Much less academic freedom than Brown; there is no open curriculum 
* Fewer, perhaps lower-quality connections with other students and professors than Brown; there are 70,000 undergrads. 
* I have heard that the alumni network at Toronto pales in comparison to Brown 
* Very intense grade deflation and purposefully over-the-top difficulty inc lasses would be pretty bad for med school admissions if I decide to take that route.

browntransfer," Hello!

(see title)

I currently go to Rice as a declared CS major. The main reason I'm considering transferring at all is because I'd wanted to be at a school where the humanities and arts are seen as a high-quality cultural thing that people love doing and contributing to. I like STEM, and I love painting and making visual art, but Rice doesn't have much of the latter going on and I've felt like it's been hard to be passionate about everything going on when this part of my life is missing.

Disclaimer, my experience has been limited (still a freshman about to enter second semester, therefore I don't know a ton of people) but as far as I can see, Rice is actually super limited in the arts and humanities. A lot of the culture is stem-focused, industry-focused, etc. and honestly I don't really vibe with it and desperately wish there were more of a (visual) arts presence on campus. What about Brown? Would it be naive to try to go here and expect it to be way better in this regard? Would trying to go to Brown for the humanities/arts culture be similar to sticking it out and carving out my own path with visual arts here at Rice? The lack of arts culture here has kind of been getting me down.

Thanks for reading, any info/experience would be greatly appreciated.","not really satisfied at current school (rice) bc too little arts presence, and looking to transfer",11,0.93,ejodq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/ejodq5/not_really_satisfied_at_current_school_rice_bc/,6,1578125691.0,2020-01-04 02:14:51

My name is Melanie and I'm wrapping up my final semester at CCRI. Hopefully it's not out of my league, but I applied to your university in October of last year to transfer. It 
took an obscene amount of courage (I am autistic and was recommended the community college route to diminish anxiety) and I'm nervous I won't make the ""cut.""

Let me give you some background on me.
I'm currently a general studies major, however, I was accepted to the nursing program, but sadly I couldn't take part because I developed autoimmune issues. My main focus is biology (hence the pun in my username). As I mentioned before, I am autistic and I was honestly petrified coming out of high school. My grades were trash because of my horrid social anxiety and I was in and out of hospitals for medical reasons. 

I was recommended to go to community college to ""get my feet wet."" I am doing exceptionally well as of right now. However, my GPA took a slight downward turn after my brother died. Currently, I have a 3.68 GPA and I've done a plethora of public speaking positions as well as volunteering. I'm also a tutor who assists students with the ""brutal"" courses such as human anatomy, physiology, abnormal psychology, cellular biology, and I also tutor Spanish.

I was recently given the nomination of being the commencement speaker of my graduating class.

goofthegoof,"Hey, I'm an incoming freshman this fall, and had some questions about purchasing health insurance. Some context: I am a US citizen living in India. My family lives here, so we don't have a family health insurance plan, which, as I've read, most people stay on till the age of 26.

This is my current understanding of how this works: Every student pays a mandatory health fees, separate from the insurance. This covers all consultations and visits at the Brown campus medical facilities. It does not, however, cover medication and/or any further testing (like X-rays). Those are charged to the insurance. 

Brown offers its own insurance package: It is a PPO policy, where, for all care provided in network, there is no copay, but a $300 annual deductible. This shouldn't be needed though, as doctors visits (at least for less serious issues) will be covered by the health fees. For medication, as long as I stick to generics wherever possible, I should be fine.

While this makes Brown's package seem pretty inviting, I would like to see what other options exist. If I get an external insurance, for example, would I still be able to access services covered by the health fees? Would I be able to purchase medication using prescriptions from the Brown doctor, even if I have an external insurance?

BROWNTHROWAWAY69,"So idk here to post this really but I'm putting it here because I value the anonymity of Reddit.

&#x200B;

Basically, I've been having a lot of problems related to sleep etc. (won't get into specifics but it's due to external factors) and I've been going to every single support service I could think of (caps, health services, reslife, etc.) but it just hasn't been working. So last night, I was having the same problem, and  was on the edge of a mental breakdown (as I have done over the past week or so).

&#x200B;

So I thought ""Oh I know I'll do the healthy thing before this breakdown and call the dean or whatever, maybe I'll be able to skip class tomorrow or get an extension on a midterm or something"" but mostly I just needed his advice. So I call the number, it puts me through to DPS, the lady on the phone asks a bunch of questions and the result was that she said ""the dean will call you in twenty minutes""

&#x200B;

SO: I wait 20 minutes (keep in mind this is the middle of the night), and I get the call. First of all, the dean sounded tired/sleepy so I would assume it's not really a full time/normal thing for him. Alright, fine. But then when I started talking about my problem, I just felt really belittled. Like honestly it's the first time I've felt talked down to in years. He did not scold me or anything like that, but I just felt like he didn't take my problem seriously. He kept on suggesting things and I was like ""Uh I've already done that"" and IDK I feel like he was unhelpful and maybe even actively harmful to my situation. He never *really* listened to me. He said that I would be contacted in the morning and I never was.

&#x200B;

Overall it felt like he didn't think mine was a ""real"" crisis. It felt like he was more just there to tell people to call DPS/an ambulance for people that called the wrong number, rather than provide an actual service. But then, in my view, what the hell is the point? I felt like mine was the exact situation that could have really benefited from a Dean's intervention but I was not given anything like that. Instead, I was given empty advice by a person who just seemed to be checking off a list of ""is this guy suicidal/in danger/in need of medical attention/etc.""

&#x200B;

SO **tl;dr** I called the administrator on call in a time of crisis and he was very unhelpful/treated me like my problem wasn't significant. I would recommend that you never call this number, and instead just go through caps/dps depending on your situation.

&#x200B;

I have no idea. I value administrators and such but I feel like through these last few weeks they have failed me, especially last night, and I just feel like I need to vent this frustration. I would like to emphasize that this is NOT an objective POV, this is just my experience and how I felt after the interaction.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: so I would like to give a quick edit for anyone reading this in the future. I eventually got my sleep issues worked out, and here's how:

1) don't take an 8am. This is pretty non-actionable advice tho 

2) get a short term prescription for ambien, or just take some Benadryl for a few days. This gets you to be where you're not completely fucking insane

3) Buy some earbuds meant for sleep. I suggest [These](https://www.amazon.com/ATECH-Flexible-Sleeping-Microphone-Relaxation/dp/B07956MHN6/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=sleep+earbuds+atech&qid=1560915687&s=gateway&sr=8-3) . Literally best $10 I ever spent, these were BY FAR the most important part of this whole thing. I suggest playing brown noise (or white noise) through them. I'm a side sleeper and I found them comfortable

4) talk to your roommate. My roommate was a really great guy and I should have just talked to him more.

But overall, I still hold to my views about the dean on call. What a shitty service.",Would not recommend the Administrator On Call system,10,0.92,9uvdho,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/9uvdho/would_not_recommend_the_administrator_on_call/,3,1541587887.0,2018-11-07 04:51:27

moonchild433,"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm a rising senior who‚Äôs very interested in applying ED to Brown. 

I love, love, love the Open Curriculum, the culture/vibes of the school (everyone seems happy and genuinely willing to help each other‚Äîthat‚Äôs exactly what I want in a college experience), the size of the school, the semester system (I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll do well with the time crunch of quarter), the focus on undergrad students, etc. Basically, I really love Brown. 

The only thing holding me back from committing 100% to applying ED is Brown‚Äôs Financial Aid. I ran the NPC and (from what I know, Brown looks at house equity‚Äîthat‚Äôs probably why I get much less financial aid here than I would at other top-tier schools) Brown is extremely expensive for my family to afford :(

I have a younger sister who‚Äôs now entering middle school, and I don‚Äôt want to take away any opportunities from her because of the financial stress I‚Äôll place with my Brown tuition. My grandparents offered to pay my entire college tuition (I am extremely lucky and grateful for their offer), but I don‚Äôt want to place a burden on them either. I would like to avoid going into debt for undergrad as much as possible, especially since I‚Äôm considering going to law school in the future. 

My heart is torn because I want to maximize my chances of getting into Brown by applying ED (and also finishing the college app process early), but I don‚Äôt want to be a financial burden to my family or myself. Is there any way for me to appeal financial aid before I apply ED? If you have any advice, please let me know. Any help would be appreciated!

EDIT: For clarification, Brown is asking for my family to pay about 50% of our income. I looked through the Brown Promise though, and they said that they'll meet 100% of demonstrated need. Is this true? My EFC is much, much lower than the price Brown is asking me to pay, so if Brown meets all of my demonstrated need, that would solve all my problems.

realcatplant,"For the schools I am looking at, I tried to look up specific information on what an art supplement should be composed of, but Brown (the school I'm most interested in and would really love to attend) doesn't have too much information on that.

Could anyone describe what kind of material should be included? Like, what percent of the work should be figure drawing, still lifes, drawings from life, etc., or if that even matters. Most of the work I do is portraiture, and some occasional less realistic and more character based pieces. I want to create a variety of works during the summer that will add to this, as I don't think that only submitting portraits is a good idea.

Or, should I even submit an art supplement at all? I would like to consider myself talented at art (I've been asked by my school to design the poster for a play, and I do a lot of art outside of school), and I participate in many art related extracurriculars. However, I haven't done any competitions, and I'm worried that without any awards, all of those extracurriculars have no real impact (as they have no idea if I am actually skilled or not). My main worry though, is that if I submit a poorly made art portfolio, it might end up hurting me more than helping me :(

I also have an instagram account specifically dedicated to art. It isn't well-known or popular, but it contains most of the work I am proud of. Would it be better just to link that somewhere instead of making a supplement? I am not planning on going into any art major btw; I am planning on taking a pre-med route.

Note:I posted this on a different thread as well, but I figured posting it on Brown's subreddit specifically would give me even more info, as my original post didn't get much traction.","How does Brown's optional art supplement/portfolio, and what are the requirements?",8,1.0,gy555m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/gy555m/how_does_browns_optional_art_supplementportfolio/,10,1591529577.0,2020-06-07 06:32:57

LordLlamacat,"I‚Äôve narrowed my college choices down to two schools: Brown and Georgia Tech.

When I applied, I wanted to go into physics, but my understanding is that the job prospects for physics aren‚Äôt great, and even after grad school and a PhD i still wouldn‚Äôt have great opportunities I love Brown‚Äôs physics dept and would prefer to study physics at Brown than at GTech, although both seem to have the same grad school/job outcomes. I‚Äôm also considering a dual major in CS and physics at brown to get better job opportunities.

My second choice major has always been electrical engineering. While I like physics a little more, electrical engineering has much better job opportunities. I know that GTech is one of the top schools for this, and from what I‚Äôve heard, brown isn‚Äôt the best. If I ended up switching into electrical engineering at Brown I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôd feel like I wasted an opportunity by turning down Georgia tech.

AdditionalTour,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a varsity athlete and was basically given an offer of admission from Brown, provided that I ED.

I loved Brown‚Äôs atmosphere and Open Curriculum, as it allows me to take the hardest classes that excite me without fear of possible failure affecting job prospects.

However, as I come from a lower-middle class family, my parents and I are concerned about the post grad career salary found here (  
[http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/09/25/brown-alums-have-lowest-median-salaries-in-ivy-league/](http://www.browndailyherald.com/2015/09/25/brown-alums-have-lowest-median-salaries-in-ivy-league/)), and they want me to ED to another college with a higher ROI instead.

Some reasons cited are a lack of students in finance and consulting and an over abundance in non-profit work. Still, I (and another commenter on the article) find it hard to believe that 20k can be attributed to those two facts.

I thought that Brown students should have one of the highest salaries in fact, given that they can take courses that they find interesting and useful, as opposed to random courses in a core. Moreover, Brown has the highest percentage of wealthy people, whom I thought would be able to provide their children with connections to high paying jobs.

Here are a couple factors that I may think contribute:

1) Brown has the fewest amount of career counselors per student, so I fear that they don‚Äôt have enough time to make connections with industry, spread Brown‚Äôs name, learn about the newest trends, or provide individualized attention.

2) Brown is smaller, so it‚Äôs alumni network in high paying fields is smaller (which is also a concern, as I heard that going to an Ivy is essentially paying for connections)

3) Brown is ranked relatively low in professional and STEM fields

4) Brown‚Äôs endowment is lower, so they invest less in career outcomes.

5) Simply put, Brown isn‚Äôt seen as prestigious as other ivies by corporate firms.

It‚Äôs really weird, given that Brown is one of the more selective ivies (after HYPC).

Can somebody comment on what they think, particularly Brown alums who may have had experience in fields I‚Äôm interested in (computer science, finance, applied math)?

I know College fit matters (which I‚Äôll take heavily into account), but this is just one factor I‚Äôd like to consider (as finances are very important to my family).

speedx77,"I was admitted into Cornell, Brown, and Upenn this year, didn't get a dime of financial aid thoo :(  I took off Cornell because it was the furthest from home and a bit in the middle of nowhere. Currently I am leaning more towards Brown but I am having my doubts.

- Coming from Long Island, I much prefer the suburbs to cities. I don't want to get mugged by rats. So Brown gets a point in that category.

- Doing Dual Degrees is easier at Brown I believe with the Open Curriculum whereas with Upenn I believe you must be admitted to the other college. I was only accepted into Upenn's College of Engineering.

- I am also big on music as I play percussion in my High School's Wind Symphony and Pep Band. I spoke with people from both schools on these issues, and even met the Brown Band. I also saw the Symphony Orchestra preform ""Made in America"" during their last Brown Day or whatever and it was fucking spectacular. That timpani player deserves a gold medal.

- The Brown dorms were okaaay, not the greatest in the world. I believe Upenn has better dorms. Albiet I only saw the Keeny dorms and nothing else. Can someone tell me more about this??

- English and creative writing is my absolute passion in life and I'd much rather have this be my single major, but I have to make money somehow ala the interest in Computer Engineering/CompSci. Brown has a really good English program, but the Kelly's Writer House at Upenn was just absolutely fantastic. Is there anything else like that at Brown? Creative Writing Clubs of any sort?

-  I don't play sports, but I am interested in participating in swimming/badminton. How do these compare at the two schools? I believe Upenn may have a bigger badminton team, but don't quote me.

- Upenn is also a bit closer to home than Brown is. For reference I live in Nassau County on Long Island. So the fastest route home besides driving would be an Amtrak to NYC and then the LIRR to get home. I'm going to miss 2 best friends. I have known them for over a decade now, and they just mean the world to me those two goofballs. They're both staying home for college, and I could too but at a lesser university (albeit for a much lower cost).

- On a side note, I tend to be more conservative than liberal, lol. I know Brown is super duper liberal, but I think I could deal with it right?

- I also got wait listed from Yale, if I get off that's gonna be another huge decision too. Might have to say Bye- Bye Brown lol. Who Knows?

throwaway98231904801,"My classes this semester have gone really, really shittily. I feel like I'll likely pass the two courses I feel really shaky on, but there's also a real chance that I won't pass--I just really fucked up this semester through a combination of taking courses I really wasn't prepared for and not spending as much time on them as I really needed to (CS18 and CS22). Actually, I do spend an obscene amount of time on these classes--probably 20 hours a week for 18 and maybe 5 for 22 (I admit: I should have really put in more like 10 or 15). Whatever the reasons are for my current situation, it's time to face the music.

If I do fail one of them, I'll be on academic warning. If I fail two, I'll be at... academic probation? I don't know the term. But luckily not suspension. **Would anyone mind sharing what it's like to be in that situation?** I know you have to meet with a dean and they notify your parents. My parents know things aren't going so well, and I feel like telling them will be horrible, but survivable. My plan for if I fail one was to try and get into one of the online summer courses (even though they're all full--I will kiss the feet of any professor who lets me into their online summer course), and if I fail two, then to either try and do two online summer courses (though that's unlikely to work out) or do an online summer course and take ENGN9 as a fifth course in the fall, and lighten up my workload.

Thanks, guys. Hope all of your finals are going better than mine are. And if you have some idea of who I am, please don't ask me about it in real life. Please be sympathetic, and realize that I'm not just some lazy airhead. Please don't share this with people in any mutual friend group.

teksmith,"Paxson just sent out an email announcing they are moving forward with the next phase and invited students to return to campus.  First day of in-person classes planned for 5OCT.

Heres the letter:

&#x200B;

Dear Members of the Brown Community,

We are writing to update you on our plans for the remainder of the fall semester at Brown. As you know, in August we announced that, in light of the public health situation involving COVID-19, the University would take a phased approach to bringing undergraduate students back to campus. We are writing to share that we have decided to move to the next phase of inviting remaining undergraduates (sophomores, juniors and seniors) to campus and beginning in-person undergraduate courses on Oct. 5. In this letter, we provide the basis for this decision, as well as relevant information for students and employees as we transition to increased on-campus operations.

Over the last several weeks, we have continued to consult with public health experts, closely monitor the public health data at campus and statewide levels, and engage in extensive analysis of several other important factors impacting our ability to keep the Brown community and the greater Providence community safe. You have heard us say many times from Day One of this pandemic that the health and safety of our community has been our top priority. We also believe that the wellbeing of our students will benefit from engaging with a thriving college environment.

We and other leaders in higher education well understand that nowhere in this country will the public health conditions be anything approximating ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for a long time, considering the trajectory of the pandemic and the projected timeline for the widespread distribution of an eventual vaccine. Yet for our own campus, what Brown and Rhode Island are currently experiencing is a set of conditions that may be among the most conducive to bringing more students back to campus that we‚Äôre likely to experience for up to a year.

We have seen an improved public health situation in Rhode Island over the past several weeks. As participation in testing has increased statewide, the number of new cases continues to trend downward, along with the state‚Äôs test positivity rate.

We have also had a good experience with our routine asymptomatic COVID-19 testing program at Brown, which has been mandatory since Aug. 24 for all of our employees authorized to be on campus and students who live in residence halls or in the Providence area. Undergraduate students are required to be tested twice a week. To date, the fraction of tests for students that are positive is very low ‚Äî about 1 in 1,000, or a test positivity rate of 0.10%. Test positivity for employees is 0.05%. In addition, test results in most cases are returned within a day.

The current low utilization of isolation and quarantine rooms is also a major consideration. We know that we must be prepared for the strong possibility of clusters of positive COVID-19 cases, just as we see in the general population. But the University is currently utilizing only a small fraction of its quarantine and isolation capacity and, so far, we have seen very few violations of our COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy. Graduate and medical students have been on campus over the summer, and while most undergraduate students have been on campus for just a few weeks, we are encouraged that they have overwhelmingly demonstrated a desire to keep the University community and the greater Providence community safe.

Given these circumstances, we have determined that we will move ahead with the second phase of welcoming students to campus and in-person instruction. Graduate courses will begin in person Sept. 16, and sophomores, juniors and seniors who wish to return to Providence will be allowed to do so beginning Sept. 18, at which time they will be subject to the mandatory Quiet Period. In-person instruction of small undergraduate classes will begin the week of Oct. 5, which is after the 14-day quarantine ends. All undergraduate students enrolled for the fall semester under this year‚Äôs three-term model have the choice to return to Providence or study remotely, and all courses for undergraduate and graduate students will accommodate remote learning.

Extensive information about how this phase of reopening will affect students, faculty and staff follows this letter. Please be sure to read this letter and the addendum in its entirety for details on telecommuting, academics, residential life, COVID-19 testing, and various campus services, policies and protocols.

It is important to note that a data-based and public health-based approach has driven and continues to form the foundation of every decision about operations since the onset of the pandemic ‚Äî reflected in the move to this phased approach to welcoming students back to campus and in-person instruction, which created the time for health indicators and testing and prevention resources to improve. Throughout the semester we will carefully monitor the public health situation on campus and in Rhode Island, and remain prepared to make adjustments to the activities that are possible on campus.

To guide this decision-making, Brown has launched a [COVID-19 Campus Activity Level Review Team](https://healthy.brown.edu/campus-activity-levels), which will allow us to move quickly from one level of campus activity to another as the public health situation demands. We have also created a public [COVID-19 dashboard](https://healthy.brown.edu/testing-tracing/dashboard) that provides daily updates on asymptomatic test positivity in the Brown community among other factors.

As I‚Äôm sure you know, to date, colleges and universities across the country have had mixed success with returning to in-person instruction. We are heartened to see that a number of our peer institutions that have testing and public health plans similar to Brown‚Äôs are faring well, and demonstrating that it is possible to learn to live with a virus that, unfortunately, may be with us for some time.

To a large degree, how the semester will unfold is up to us. Brown has prepared extensively to support the health of the community with its comprehensive testing and contact tracing programs and added cleaning and safety protocols. But, these measures alone will not stop the spread of the virus. It remains essential that all members of the Brown community embrace personal responsibility in following public health guidance, including mask-wearing, social distancing and increased cleaning. We must care about each other and all the people whose lives will be affected by our actions. We all must stand ready to make sacrifices in our social lives to protect Brown and the greater community, and to have a successful semester.

Whether you choose to study at Brown or remotely, we look forward to a semester that is intellectually engaging and socially supportive.

Sincerely,

Christina H. Paxson, PresidentRichard M. Locke, ProvostBarbara Chernow, Executive Vice President for Finance and Administration

**UPDATES FOR NEXT PHASE OF ON-CAMPUS OPERATIONS AND COMMENCING IN-PERSON INSTRUCTION**

Please review this section for the following categories of operational updates from across the University as Brown moves to the next phase of increased on-campus operations, including offering in-person instruction:

* Telecommuting and ‚ÄúReturn to Campus‚Äù Plans
* Academics (for students, faculty and staff)
* Student Residential Life
* COVID-19 Testing for Students and Employees
* Travel Policies and Quarantine
* Campus Services (dining, library, bookstore, mail, shuttle, parking)
* Visitors, Programming and Events

**TELECOMMUTING AND ‚ÄúRETURN TO CAMPUS‚Äù PLANS**

Even with the move toward in-person instruction, the University expects individuals who can work remotely to continue to do so; this is central to promoting a healthy University environment. Telecommuting for all regular employees who are able to complete their work remotely continues through the end of the fall term, Dec. 23, 2020.

Nevertheless, moving to increased on-campus operations with the arrival of more students may affect planning being done across offices and departments to determine which employees are able to work remotely to fulfill their responsibilities, and those who may need to work at a Brown location regularly or occasionally. Academic and administrative units should assess their operations to determine if the shift to more on-campus operations requires a re-assessment of the designations of employees and/or a resubmission of Return to Campus Plans.

Units that have not yet submitted a work plan that includes on-campus and remote staffing needs should review the [Return to Campus Plans and Guidelines](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/human-resources/return-campus-plans-and-guidelines) webpage. If plans require an update, please submit an addendum with any necessary adjustment to the relevant committee listed on the page. Department leaders should continue to follow guidelines in managing schedules with their employees based on the nature of their job assignments.

**Student Employment:**

Opportunities for student employment for the fall term will be largely offered on a remote basis. Limited in-person opportunities will also be available. Students who are interested in work can [search for student job opportunities](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/human-resources/how-search-student-job-opportunities) in Workday. Questions regarding student employment can be submitted directly to [Student\_Employment@brown.edu](mailto:Student_Employment@brown.edu).

**ACADEMICS**

The University‚Äôs phased approach to beginning in-person instruction does not impact Brown‚Äôs plans for a three-term academic calendar. The [2020-21 Academic Calendar](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/registrar/academic-calendar) is online, and [Fall 2020 Academic Policies](https://healthy.brown.edu/academics/policies-fall-2020) for remote and hybrid instruction for undergraduate and graduate students are now posted on the Healthy Brown website.

**For Undergraduate Students:**

As announced previously, all undergraduate classes will be taught remotely until the week of Oct. 5. Classes began remotely on Wednesday, Sept. 9, and will continue remotely throughout the next phase of student move-in from Sept. 18 to Sept. 20 and the Quiet Period for newly arriving students. The 14-day Quiet Period is a requirement for all arriving undergraduates living on campus, no matter when you arrive during the phased resumption of on-campus operations. Hybrid undergraduate classes may begin meeting in person the week of Oct. 5.

Students returning to campus in September may [reach out to academic advising deans](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/academicadvisinghours) for support for navigating classes during move-in and the Quiet Period.

**For Graduate Students:**

For graduate students enrolled in courses numbered below 2000, if these courses are listed as hybrid, they will meet remotely until Oct. 5 and will then continue according to their original, hybrid format. Fully graduate courses, those numbered 2000 and above, will proceed in either a hybrid or online format, depending on their designation in Courses@Brown, after the conclusion of the Quiet Period for graduate students on Sept. 15.

Graduate students teaching in the fall will continue to teach fully online until the week of Oct. 5. Following that date, undergraduate courses will resume in their currently planned delivery mode (hybrid or online). If you are serving as a teaching assistant, fellow or independent instructor, you may elect to continue to teach remotely for the full semester.

A substantial number of graduate students have already been approved to be on campus. These include graduate students who have been approved for on-campus research in labs, graduate students who have indicated that their location status is ‚Äúon campus‚Äù (this includes students in labs, students who are taking hybrid courses or who are teaching hybrid courses and have not elected to do so remotely), and graduate students who have been approved for access to departmental spaces through an approved departmental Return to Campus Plan.

**For Medical Students:**

First- and second-year students at the Warren Alpert Medical School have been successfully attending a mix of online and required in-person components of the curriculum since early August. One hundred percent of actively enrolled pre-clerkship students are participating in the campus-wide COVID-19 testing and symptom tracking program.

**For Faculty, Instructors and Staff (including postdocs):**

Remote/Hybrid/In-person Instruction: As we welcome students to begin in-person instruction the week of Oct. 5, we anticipate offering some hybrid courses with in-person sessions of fewer than 20 students. As a reminder, all class and section meetings of 20 or more students must be online.

Faculty and instructors planning to teach in person or to offer hybrid instruction with some in-person components may visit the assigned classroom in advance of teaching by contacting the Digital Learning and Design team at [DLD@brown.edu](mailto:DLD@brown.edu). Faculty may choose to teach their course exclusively online, and may also opt to do so at any point in the term. In addition, since many students are studying remotely, all courses must be designed to accommodate online instruction for remote learners. Online classes may be offered either asynchronously or synchronously.

Lab and Performance Courses: As part of planning for the fall, the Office of the Provost has requested that all lab, studio and performance classes that involve an in-person component develop plans for safe instruction. Please review the following memos from Provost Richard M. Locke for details about the processes for laboratory courses and performance/studio courses: [Safe Instruction: Performance/Studio Courses](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/provost/communications/safe-instruction-performancestudio-courses) and [Safe Instruction: Laboratory Courses](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/provost/communications/safe-instruction-laboratory-courses).

Support for Teaching and Learning: Substantial resources are available to support online teaching and learning from the Digital Learning & Design team. Designed for faculty who are planning to teach in the spring and summer terms, the Fall Term Anchor Program will be offered over five weeks from Oct. 19 to Nov. 20, 2020. For more information and to apply, please see the [Sheridan Center](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/teaching-resources/teaching-times-disruption) website. For instructors seeking additional support for online courses, please contact [DLD@brown.edu](mailto:DLD@brown.edu) and/or [Sheridan\_Center@brown.edu](mailto:Sheridan_Center@brown.edu) for information.

Research: Research activity remains at Stage 2 of Resuming Research. Principal Investigators interested in updating their Stage 2 plans to reflect any personnel changes should follow the [Resuming Work in Research Facilities Principles and Procedures: Stage 2](https://www.brown.edu/research/sites/research/files/Stage%202%20of%20Brown%20Resuming%20Work%20in%20Research%20Facilities.pdf) guidelines, which include important information about ensuring health and safety in research labs, as well as parameters for undergraduate involvement in labs.

**STUDENT RESIDENTIAL LIFE**¬†

**For All Undergraduates:**

All students who will be living in the Providence area, whether you live on or off campus, will be required to read and sign the Student Commitment to COVID-19 Community Health and Safety Requirements (Student Commitment); complete an online educational module; and follow a set of pre-arrival requirements and recommendations.

You will also be subject to Brown‚Äôs COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy and must participate in the COVID-19 testing program while you are in the Providence area, including a required test upon arrival in Providence. These are necessary safeguards for student health and well-being and that of the broader Brown and Providence communities.

Failure to comply with the health and safety requirements contained in the Student Commitment (including but not limited to wearing masks, social distancing, testing, contact tracing, and limiting the size of social gatherings for attendees and especially hosts ‚Äî all whether on or off campus) will be a violation of the Code of Student Conduct. Violations will be addressed through the COVID-19 Student Conduct Procedures with sanctions up to and including removal from campus and academic suspension.

Students who change plans and prefer to live and study remotely outside of the Providence area must send an email from their Brown address to [Fall2020@brown.edu](mailto:Fall2020@brown.edu) to request a change in your location of study. The final deadline for this request is 5 p.m. EDT on Monday, Sept. 14. We particularly encourage this option for students with health conditions that may place them in a high-risk category. You will receive a confirmation email when your location of study has been updated. Students who choose a remote location of study and live in the Providence area will be violating the University‚Äôs rules and potentially endangering the health and safety of themselves and others. Dishonesty about location of study will be referred to the student conduct process, and possible sanctions could include academic suspension.

**For Undergraduates Returning to Live On Campus:**

To gather information needed to make housing assignments, the Office of Residential Life previously contacted students who will be living in a residence hall on campus. This information was due on Sept. 7. Move-in will occur between Friday, Sept. 18, and Sunday, Sept. 20. You will be able to choose one of these three days when you receive your housing assignment (no later than 11:59 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, Sept. 15). Detailed arrival information will be provided with this communication. All students will be required to observe the 14-day Quiet Period, which will include a period of time when you will be required to remain in your residence hall except to get a COVID-19 test, receive care from Health Services by appointment, or to pick up dining hall meals. All students returning to campus will observe the Quiet Period regardless of pre-arrival test status (including antibody testing) and geographical point of departure.**For Undergraduates Returning to Live Off Campus:**

Students living off campus will be scheduled for their first COVID-19 test with Brown shortly after arrival in Providence. If you have not already provided your arrival date, you will soon be asked to do so to become enrolled in COVID-19 testing with Brown.

Off-campus students must follow state-mandated 14-day quarantine requirements in place for people entering Rhode Island from outside the United States and from certain states within the country. You are responsible for keeping apprised of the state directives specific to your situation and for planning your arrival and quarantine accordingly. This may include completion of a certificate of compliance with out-of-state travel quarantine and testing requirements upon arriving in Rhode Island, as well as completion of an out-of-state travel screening form.

Between Sept. 18 and Oct. 4, most students on campus will be observing the Quiet Period. During this time, students who reside off campus are not permitted on campus. Off-campus students are not permitted in the residence halls at any time.

**COVID-19 TESTING FOR STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES**

With the increase in community members on campus, a routine testing program ‚Äî which tests individuals regardless of symptoms ‚Äî will continue to be essential for identifying and preventing community spread of novel coronavirus at the earliest possible stage. Students, faculty and staff who are approved to return to campus to live, study or work are required to undergo COVID-19 testing at times and dates established by the University.

All community members who are subject to mandatory testing will receive an initial baseline test upon arrival to campus. After the baseline test, these individuals will be tested either once or twice per week, depending on the amount of regular contact they are likely to have with others. Information on testing frequency for students and employees is available on the student and employee [testing pages](https://healthy.brown.edu/testing-tracing) on the Healthy Brown website. If you are required to enroll in the routine testing program, you will receive an email before your arrival to campus with instructions on how to enroll, schedule your first test and track any symptoms daily.

In addition to the routine testing program, Brown has guidance in place for anyone who experiences COVID-19 symptoms. Anyone with symptoms should immediately self-isolate, limit contact with other individuals and stay away from campus, including for any scheduled routine tests. To arrange for a symptomatic test or coordinate for care, students should contact Health Services at 401-863-1330 or [nursing@health.brown.edu](mailto:nursing@health.brown.edu). Employees should contact their primary health care provider and inform University Human Resources at 401-368-4828 or [leave\_admin@brown.edu](mailto:leave_admin@brown.edu).

**TRAVEL POLICIES AND QUARANTINE**

Any student, faculty or staff member who arrives from a location beyond Rhode Island (or who leaves Brown and returns) must follow state requirements, which may require a 14-day quarantine before conducting activities outside of an individual‚Äôs place of residence. For Brown community members who complete quarantine or are not required to do so, Brown‚Äôs guidelines on travel beyond campus will be shaped by the Campus Activity Status level in place at any given time, along with Brown‚Äôs [policy on High-Risk and Restricted Travel](https://healthy.brown.edu/prevention/travel-policies), which remains in place.

Brown has suspended all international and domestic travel organized, sponsored or supported by the University through Jan. 3, 2021. This applies to all undergraduates and (unless an exception is approved) to graduate students, medical students, faculty and staff. This includes not only air travel, but local travel for field trips organized by faculty, staff or students for academic or other purposes. We urge all community members to avoid non-essential personal travel and to minimize movement off campus to the greatest extent possible.

**Travel for Undergraduate Students:**

Out-of-state travel is permitted for undergraduates only in emergencies and with approval, unless a student will remain away from campus for the duration of the fall semester. Travel within Providence for undergraduates will be guided by the prevailing Campus Activity Status level for such functions as visiting medical providers, commercial establishments and other local purposes. Additional details are available on the [Campus Activity Status](https://healthy.brown.edu/campus-activity-levels) and [Travel Policy](https://healthy.brown.edu/prevention/travel-policies) pages of the Healthy Brown website.

Undergraduates Who have Finished their Quiet Period: Beginning Sept. 16, students on meal plans who are already on campus and have completed the required Quiet Period will be able to go into two eateries to pick up their grab-and-go meals: Verney-Woolley and Andrews Commons. For Andrews, ordering will be required through the [Get Food App](https://ithelp.brown.edu/kb/articles/ordering-food-with-the-get-mobile-app).

Newly Arriving Undergraduate Students: For newly arriving students beginning their Quiet Period, Dining Services will have several meal delivery/pick-up locations to collect grab-and-go meals. These pick-up locations will be assigned based on residence hall proximity. Students will receive this information with their room assignment from Residential Life.

Graduate Students and Employees: As the fall semester begins, faculty, staff and graduate students may access meals on a grab-and-go basis at the Blue Room in the Stephen Robert ‚Äô62 Campus Center. The Brown Faculty Club will continue to offer the Brown to Table curbside pickup program to Faculty Club members. Safety guidelines must be followed when visiting dining locations.

**Library Services:**

The Library will be opening spaces for de-densified individual student work on a reservation basis. Graduate and medical students will have access beginning Sept. 16, and undergraduates will have access as of Oct. 5 In addition, the Library continues to support faculty and students in the following ways:

* Digital access to materials for courses and scholarship
* ""Take-out"" ordering and circulation of physical materials
* Remote consultation with the Library‚Äôs experts

**Brown Bookstore:**

The Brown Bookstore is scheduled to be open beginning Sept. 16. Students who finished their Quiet Period will be able to access the store in person, while complying with all health and safety protocols. Newly arriving students will not be able to use the bookstore in person until Oct. 5, at the conclusion of the Quiet Period. The bookstore is developing plans to process online orders for course materials and deliver them to students‚Äô designated meal pick-up locations.

**Mail Services:**

Mail Services will be open for business beginning Sept. 16 for University employees approved to be on campus, and for students who have completed the relevant quarantine or Quiet Period. The University is developing options to support in-person customers in compliance with health protocols, as well as newly arriving students who will be adhering to Quiet Period and unable to access Mail Services in person. These students will have course materials and critical packages delivered to their designated meal pick-up locations.

**Shuttles:**

Passengers who use shuttle bus services must abide by health protocols to ride safely. All Brown University Shuttle routes are fully operational at this time, and the University may expand shuttle service depending on the location of students in residence. If more students move into the Jewelry District, the daytime Connector route will be modified to accommodate Chestnut Street. In addition, Brown may add an express weekend and evening fixed route for those living in that area. Additional information can be accessed on the [Transportation and Parking Services](https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/transportation/) website.

**Parking:**

Currently, any Brown employee who comes to campus can park in any University surface parking lot, with the exception of the leased street parking spaces that are enforced by the City of Providence. As more employees return to campus and lots start to become congested, we will return to our normal system of parking permits.

**VISITORS, PROGRAMMING AND EVENTS**

**Visitors:**

The University recently updated restrictions for Fall 2020 regarding the hosting of non-degree visiting and exchange students, visiting faculty and researchers, and general visitors for the coming year. Learn more by visiting the [Visiting Campus](https://healthy.brown.edu/life-campus/visiting-campus) page in the Life on Campus section of the Healthy Brown website.

**Programming and Events:**

The expectation remains that most events and programming will be offered virtually in the fall semester. Any small gatherings planned on-site must follow University safety protocols and Rhode Island Department of Health guidelines in terms of numbers of individuals permitted, social distancing, use of face coverings etc. Also consult the Campus Activity Status levels on the Healthy Brown website for guidance on permissible activities. For students, guidelines for extracurricular activities are being reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Student Activities Office.

Monster2060,"I've been looking at Brown's AP credit page and I'm confused by these two sentences:

""Advanced Placement exam scores are not eligible for course credit at Brown, but students may use certain AP scores to enroll in higher-level courses and/or to satisfy concentration requirements. In other words, AP credit will not increase your course credit total.¬†""

At a first glance this seems to say that AP credit won't count towards your concentration requirements nor the minimum 30 classes needed to graduate. 

But then for the AP Euro section it says if you receive a 5 it ""earns AP credit for 1 unassigned history course upon the successful completion of any one 1000-level course in European history."" As well as history majors can't receive credit for it. 

The AP Euro section seems to suggest if I take a 1000 level Euro class, I receive 1 credit for the class and 1 credit for AP Euro. However, this seems to contradict ""AP credit will not increase your course credit total,"" unless that really means AP credits won't be counted towards the 40 class limit for 8 semesters, but CAN count towards the 30 minimum courses needed to graduate. 

So if what I just said is correct I can technically graduate without taking 30 classes at Brown because of AP credit? But, I can also graduate with more than 40 course credits on my transcript because of excess AP credit?

Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading!

I would appreciate it if students with experience with the pre-health advising could share their thoughts, if it's a significant disadvantage. I am also a bit confused (and concerned?) from what I've heard about the advisers strongly recommending people to take gap years before applying to medical school.

,"I am a high school senior trying to decide whether to ED to Brown or not, and I would greatly appreciate your feedback on Brown's chemistry department. I heard from friends that STEM professors at top universities become professors not because they're good at teaching, but because of their world-class research, and that professors at very research-focused universities mainly care about their research and don't really care about teaching undergrads. As a result, these universities (I.e. Yale) have poor chemistry courses taught by professors that can't teach too well (at least this is what I heard from Yale students). Since Brown ranks high in undergraduate teaching, have a very small graduate school, and is not a research powerhouse, it seems likely that Brown will not have this problem.

GOGOYOLO,"Specifically, I would like to know:

1. How is the quality of professors and instruction? Brown is famous/infamous (depending on your perspective) for its liberal bent, but how does that look in the Political Science department? Are professors willing to look at multiple sides of issues, or do you get the feeling that they are pushing an agenda more so than they are exploring a subject? Not to say that they aren't allowed to inject personal beliefs, but do you feel that this impacts your education/grasp of a subject in a one-sided or negative way?

2.  Also, are the classes more lecture-style or discussion-based? What does homework look like? How accessible are resources/professors if needed for help or advice? Also, If you've had interesting research opportunities, I would love to know about them.

3.  I'm excited about the school because of what seems like a positive, collaborative academic environment with lots of freedom. However, I can also see how the grading systems might create a lazy or less serious/ambitious underbelly, and that perhaps a high GPA from Brown might be taken less seriously because of the perception of grade inflation. It seems like the safety net for failure might just be too big, and that may have negative ramifications on the legitimacy of a Brown education. This is just speculation, though, and I'd like to know what actual Brown students think of all this.

cordialanole,"Hello,

I'm a freshman applying to transfer to Brown next fall--I hope to meet some of you wonderful people in the future! I'm currently at another top twenty, and have discovered I'm not a very good fit for the pervasive preprofessional emphasis of my major.

Do you think someone with good stats (4.0 college GPA, 1570 SAT, 3.7 uw high school GPA) has a *significantly* higher chance than the acceptance rate suggests, or is the applicant pool mostly composed of similarly qualified individuals? 

I have several years research experience in interdisciplinary STEM fields, good relationships with current professors, and a passion for a new research field. I'm fascinated by the more theoretical problems in my subject, and Brown offers a major that fulfills that direction (just to give some background). 

I'm grateful to anyone who shares their opinion about whether I should apply, or whether the acceptance rate is simply too low, and that I should probably look elsewhere.

brownphysicsmajor,"Hi!

I'm a junior in physics and work at the front desk in Advancement and just had someone ask about a Brown student willing to let a high school senior shadow them for a morning class and then lunch (they'd also like to see a Brown dorm room).

There are two prospective students, twin brothers. They were described to me as follows:

Simon is artistic and very visual. He is into architecture and building cars. He also loves WWII history, music and film. He has high energy and likes to see creativity in action.

Joshua is more literary, enjoys psychology and economics. He has a lot of charisma and is interested in people doing good in the world.

I'd do it but I don't think I really qualify since this is only my second semester here, I live off campus, and I'm a physics major (and have literally only taken math and physics at Brown) which doesn't really seem to lie within their interests.

The twins are planning to arrive on campus around 10-11 AM. They'd each like to shadow a student, so I'm looking for TWO Brown students. So if you have a class (or two) between 10-12 on Monday you could take him to your class and then take him to lunch and then show him your dorm room. That'd be it. 

So is anyone up for it? If not, could you ask a friend? If you want my email/phone/whatever, just send me a message. 

If you are interested, please either respond to this post or send me a message with a little bit about yourself (major, year, etc). Please include contact information.

throwmall,"Hi, I‚Äôm an incoming freshman and as of right now, CS is gonna be my concentration. However, my only CS experience has been taking AP CS A at my high school (so Java is the only language I know). I got a 4 on the AP exam. I‚Äôve been looking at the different CS courses for incoming freshmen, and I watched a video explaining the four different introductory pathways. The beginning of the video says that CSCI0170 and CSCI0180 are a good place to start if you‚Äôve taken an AP CS course, yet the video later states that it‚Äôs for people with no prior experience. Then, the video says that people *without* prior experience can take CSCI0190, which I know is the accelerated course that requires a placement exam. It‚Äôs all a bit confusing and I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôd fit into all that. Are there any current Brown students who entered the CS program with only AP CS A experience or something similar to that? What class did you start with, and do you think it was a good fit? 

Also, the comments on [this similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/fc0k08/csci_0190_placement_as_a_freshman/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) from a while ago suggest that CSCI0190 may leave some gaps in your knowledge if you‚Äôre not super experienced. Because of that, I‚Äôm leaning towards CSCI0170 and CSCI0180. Since those courses are *apparently* for students with no prior experience, would it be pointless to take the course? I‚Äôm assuming not but I‚Äôm a bit unsure so I just wanted to ask anyways

SwellFloop,"I've been trying to figure out my courses for my first semester. I'm worried because there's a time conflict between CLPS300 (Intro to Linguistics) and another one of my classes. I thought I could just take CLPS300 next term, but I couldn't actually find any results for a spring version of the course in CAB. Same goes for CLPS0010. Is it even possible to take CLPS300 or CLPS0010 in the spring semester, or is it only offered in the fall? Is this just some weird thing with CAB, or will I have to figure out some way to take them both this term?

I was offered a position in Brown's summer undergraduate research program. I'm really excited for this opportunity but I've never been to Providence or Rhode Island and had some questions. Any help or insight would be appreciated.

My program doesn't include a meal plan, so I was wondering how accessible Brown's campus is to grocery stores, etc.? Are groceries expensive up there? Good/cheap places to eat on campus?

What are some facilities/centers/libraries I should take advantage of while at Brown?

What are some cool things to do in the summer in Providence? what's the social scene like? (I know my campus is usually pretty dead in the summer)

Do they allow guests in the dorms? All I know right now is they offer us the apartment-style dorms, I guess I'll probably find out more details as we get closer to the summer.

yeepfudor,"I'm currently a Korean high school junior attending an international school in my country. I'm desperate for your advice! I heard about BS/MD programs in the summer of my junior year and have been wanting to apply. The main reason why I want to apply for BS/MD so much is because it is very difficult for international students to get in an American med school. I want to live in the US and become a doctor as well, so a guaranteed seat in a med school would be amazing for me.

I wanted to apply for Brown's PLME first, because I love the idea of their liberal arts education. In Korea, pre-meds are banned from taking literature and other social sciences during high school. However, I love them and that's the main reason why I chose the international track in the first place. PLME was also one of the few BS/MD programs that were positive towards international students when I asked about the program during the admissions info session.

Sadly, my parents are saying that I should give up on BS/MD admissions because of the extreme competition. Dad said that I should forget about PLME when applicants are literally having their research published on Nature. What do BS/MD students do for their ECs? I know they shadow doctors and do research, and I've done those a lot, but how important are awards and honors? Every BS/MD student on reddit, mostly PLME/HPME/Washu USP/CaseWestern, seem to be a national olympiad champion, ISEF finalist, SAT 1600, school president etc at the same time. I am going to be a senior soon and I am none of those!

I'm an introvert, and I have forced myself to go out for class president a few times in the past, but it was too stressful. I spent my freshman and sophomore year at an ordinary Korean school with no international curriculum, so I didn't even know ECs were important until the start of my junior year. I had only three weeks to study for my first AP exam, so I currently only have three APs (comparative politics, micro, psych) with 5s. My SATs are 1540/Math2 800/Bio 760, which aren't bad, but not high enough for BS/MDs. It feels like my only strengths are a perfect GPA, high school rank, and some research on cancer and other diseases. I have loads of school awards, but only few minor national awards and no pretigious international awards at all. I didn't know being a well rounded student only focused on academics could be weak for US admissions, unlike Korean admissions. I've considered applying for very low schools with BS/MDs, but the thing is, if I apply ED to increase my chance of going in the program, I may be forced to attend as an undergraduate student at a school that's not my first choice if I am rejected from BS/MD. The risk is too high, since Asian international applicants are hard to get in anywhere.
