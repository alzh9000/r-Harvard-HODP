1. the school is only allowing internationals to stay in the summer if they’re taking (online!) classes (a clear money scheme from dartmouth), which is financially unaffordable for some international students AND also doesn’t meet their visa requirements! 

2. dean lively implied in the email that there were international students who “wished to leave.” this seems like a far stretch given that nobody wished to leave — internationals were ORDERED TO LEAVE UNDER THE THREAT OF EXPULSION 

3. dean lively’s email attempted to trivialize the problems and make international students seem ungrateful when they have been anything but those things 

don’t fall for dartmouth’s administration’s propaganda. the school is evicting international students with just a two week notice, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

Coronavirus Response,lockedoutthrowaway23,"R y'all serious? This is SO MUCH MISINFORMATION. I suggest you read the emails that have all of this information instead of blowing it off as ""useless.""

1. They announced that students had to leave by Monday on the previous Wednesday. That was WAY more time than other colleges gave them.
2. Given how fast the situation changed within that same week before leaving, could you blame them for delaying given the fact that Dartmouth sustains the entire local economy of Hanover? Unlike other schools, Dartmouth had other factors to consider because us shutting down had more at stake than just the well-being of students.
3. Are you saying that telling people to leave and come back wouldn't potentially bring the virus to campus/increase its spread/unnecessarily burden a rural community with an older population that relies on ONE hospital to sustain basically all of northern new england? Get over yourself. 
4. I've been refunded in full for housing and meals, including student fees. They said they'd get it done by March 25 if you read the student assembly FAQ (which they did), and added on student fee refunds today. This is just straight up wrong. 

Also, as for the dorm situation, their response wasn't perfect, but not in the ways you expected. They approved all international students to stay on campus EXCEPT those who were already US citizens by MISTAKE. According to OPAL/the FYSEP coordinator, this was unintentional because it was done automatically. 

Additionally, they made channels of communication open through the dean of the college email account, offered additional support through several offices, and have communicated daily with new information and updates. 

They couldn't cancel spring break and isolate everyone on campus because PEOPLE ALREADY STARTED LEAVING. Most people I knew didn't have finals that thursday/friday. I was literally on a bus when Harvard canceled that Tuesday morning, and a ton of others were already off campus by then. No one expected Harvard to cancel, and I don't think any of the peers intended to either until that happened. This sent the higher education world into a meltdown, and Dartmouth had to worry not just about a student body but a local economy too. 

The schools you mentioned (Harvard, Yale, Pton & more) also sent off their students really abruptly without telling htem how they could find housing/accommodations and told them not to come back while they were in the middle of their spring breaks. Most of these schools actually fucked over international and low-income students by providing no information (Harvard, particularly, announced they were cancelling and didn't tell low-income/international students what to do), some even denied international NON-US-CITIZEN students (cough: princeton) from staying, and all just totally screwed people over. 

I don't defend Dartmouth in a lot of things. This is something I will say they did better than most. The only university that I think addressed this better was Cornell; they did everything we had to ask Dartmouth for, but way earlier.

Read your emails next time. They updated people daily, were communicative, and answered questions as soon as those answers were available.",16,,False,flml15j,False,False,1585286875.0,2020-03-27 00:27:55

2. I don't blame them for shutting down: I blame them for strategically releasing this information the day after forcing students to evict and having tuition due.

3. Absolutely, students shouldn't come back to Hanover. But disallowing those students who were _still in Hanover_ from getting their belongings is awful.

4. I'm glad to hear that you personally received what they said they would provide! Regardless, that isn't the case for all students (including myself), and expecting students to be able to relocate (and pay first months' rent + deposit) and then giving them money a week later is weak, and it's not like the school doesn't have the funds available.

5. Declining to offer housing for their low-income students is a failing, period. Even if they were willing to house international students, the fact is that they said that they would only house students in ""exceptional"" cases -- and otherwise _being homeless_ was apparently not considered an exceptional case. Not sure how them admittedly _mistakenly_ allowing students to stay changes anything...

I'm also not sure where you got the idea that I called the emails ""useless""  or weren't reading them: I was paying very close attention to them, and I read every last one, as my having food and shelter depended on it.

I know I have to make the decision for myself but I’d love to hear your opinions...",gradschoolsearch763,"This was my situation when I was starting undergrad (at Georgetown). My parents made too much money to qualify for aid but weren't willing to pay (this was just before the last recession so college was a little bit cheaper but I was still staring down $50k/year). I was going to study math/cs so I knew worst case I could go sell my soul in banking for a few years and knock off my debt. I did a lot of introspection about what was important to me in life. I decided that a solid education was very important to me, I felt that Georgetown could do it best, and I decided that part of my education was going to involve financing my education. I worked nearly full time while double majoring and having a great social life. I took jobs that didn't pay as well but let me do homework on the job or go to events that I would have had to pay to go to otherwise. I worked multiple jobs in the summer and took jobs that included housing to eliminate that expense. I still graduated $80k in debt. I kept up that lifestyle for 2 more years and paid it all off. It's a gamble and it's not the right decision for most people. I considered transferring after my freshman year so I wouldn't have to work as much. However, I would do it all again knowing everything that I do now. If you have a very strong reason to go to Dartmouth instead of someplace different, if you are comfortable living on very little money, and if you are willing to work your ass off even when your friends aren't, you can do it.

I graduated into a recession and all of my Georgetown friends had jobs within a few months of graduation. Most of my friends who went to state school did not. I don't know what the Dartmouth alumni network is like (I just saw this post and it reminded me so much of myself at that age I had to respond). Big name schools do carry weight on your resume. When I was in high school everyone told me it didn't matter. I've done hiring for several big tech companies and I've seen great resumes passed over in favor of those who went to a brand name school. In a recession, the big name school will get you an interview over a better qualified candidate (at least in Silicon Valley).",2,,False,fowrc5c,False,False,1588125505.0,2020-04-28 20:58:25

I got into Georgetown University for undergrad, but didn’t receive any aid. But I got into a few state schools and I even got full tuition and a stipend from the school I ultimately chose and I don’t regret it one bit. My state school taught me sooo much and it is because I was able to save that money that now I’m able to go to Dartmouth for grad school this fall.

I like that your app takes this general idea into account, but I'm wondering if the scheduling aspect makes the process of virtual dating almost cumbersome.

Dartmouth has great classes for pre-med, but at least in my experience the Chemistry classes are much more difficult than you find other places. I was pre-med until I got another low grade in Orgo II, at which point I paused that plan and decided that if I still wanted to do it, I'd do a post-bach. 

During that time, I also helped my friends in their SUNY school's chem, bio, and math courses. All of those were FAR easier, and I'm fairly confident that had I gone there, I'd have stuck with pre-med and applied to med school.",14,,False,flonz5n,False,False,1585342003.0,2020-03-27 15:46:43
Pre-Med Experience at Dartmouth??,veteranshipper,"Speaking as a recent grad and someone who got into med school this year, if you're going to be a gunner, go be a gunner at UT. It's cheaper, you'll probably get to focus more on just knocking out pre-med pre-reqs, and odds are you'll do better, and you probably get more insight into TMDSAS. You'll be surrounded by people who all want the same thing, which is a great support system, but can also breed competition.

Dartmouth gives you the opportunity to branch out and explore other things that round you out as a human being like how humanities and art intersect in medicine, getting involved in the Upper Valley community, and finding connections to other fields that give you a unique perspective as an applicant. You won't have to be a bio major or neuro major to succeed. In addition, you can take advantage of its UG research opportunities (paid!), incredible alumni network, and easily obtained experience in a Trauma I hospital or clinical setting without much competition. The quarter system has pros and cons. 

If being a traditional applicant is something that is important to you, UT might be a better fit. At Dartmouth, it's really common to take 1-3 years off before applying to medical school. I took one. I didn't know coming into college that I wanted to go to medical school, and I picked Dartmouth because of the freedom it gave me to explore my options and to consider the ethical implications of my career paths. Along the way, I had almost too many people giving me advice about how to do pre-med correctly, to the point where I, being the cynic I am, stopped going to advising for anything other than emotional support until I started my application cycle. It takes Liberal Arts very seriously. 

Also, I want to dispel the myth of the weed out classes--these courses are HARD no matter where you go, but at nowhere is any professor actively plotting to weed students out of medicine. You weed yourself out. Don't blame the profs who are just doing their jobs. As for getting As, well, you don't need to be Phi Beta Kappa to get into a really good medical school. Med schools these days are more and more about fit and about who you are in the clinic.

Pre-Med Experience at Dartmouth??,GyanTheInfallible,"I applied Early Decision to Dartmouth but had previously been admitted to UT Austin’s Liberal Arts Honors Program. My family had paid in to Texas Tomorrow, so there were even larger financial advantages to attending that school.

What drew me to Dartmouth was the community, the bright and engaged future leaders I’d meet who would push me to be my best, the faculty who would take me under their wing. 

I’m also on the pre-Medical track and am applying this cycle. I’ll be completing a Master’s degree during my gap year. More than 80% of those who apply to medical school with a Dartmouth degree score an acceptance on their first go. That’s nearly double the national average. I majored in Linguistics and minored in Chemistry, and I studied abroad twice. I completed all pre-Medical course requirements by the end of my sophomore year and had no trouble doubling up with laboratories. Courses are stimulating but not overwhelming. You’ll receive plenty of support from peers, advisors, TAs (and the Teaching Science Fellows) and faculty. There is no toxic pre-Medical culture at Dartmouth comparable to anything I’ve heard described elsewhere. You’ll find research mentors, internships, etc. that will enrich you and enhance your application.

I’ve TA’d General and Organic Chemistry, as well as Cell Biology and some non-science courses, so if I can be at help at any point, let me know.",4,,1585408083.0,flp4t3v,False,False,1585351676.0,2020-03-27 18:27:56
Pre-Med Experience at Dartmouth??,anahitakodali,"I'm a 23', so many of my experiences are much more limited than those of the other commenters, but as someone who went to Dartmouth instead of University of Pittsburgh Honours (where I got nearly a full ride - I'm paying about 40k a year more at Darty), I think there are a few reasons to choose Dartmouth. 

Professors and classes at Dartmouth are incredible. I don't know a lot about the UT schools, but in my experience, the professors at Dartmouth are there to teach, while professors at Pitt are there to do research. I've been able to learn a ton in all my classes and they've been crazy accessible for both office hours. You're also paying for incredible opportunities for undergraduate research. If you've never done research before, there are several formal internships that can help you get started (I was a Women in Science Project intern this year, for example), but I also got offers to work in labs just by emailing profs. You're paying for Ivy name brand too - not a huge factor, but certainly something I considered. 

I've taken one premed class so far: chem 5 (which is general chemistry 1). I never took AP chemistry in highschool, and my AP bio teacher was antivaxx if that gives you any indication of the science quality of my highschool. I poured a ton of work into that class, and by a ton, I mean that during the week, all time I wasn't actively doing something else (class, research, clubs, homework for other classes), I was studying chemistry. I still got to hang out with my friends and have fun, but chem was a huge time commitment. If you've taken it before, you definitely won't have to spend as much time as me, but it'll still be a lot of work. 

So far, my only regret about Dartmouth is the language requirement. I  decided to take a language I had never studied in highschool, and it's  hurt my GPA, though that isn't the experience of most students. Just something to keep in mind! Also, as someone who came into Dartmouth strongly premed and definitely a STEM major, liberal arts is something that I actually liked because it forced me to take classes that aren't STEM - I'm going to be a bio major, WGSS minor, and I won't have to take a gap year. However, this took a lot of careful Dplanning, and I know most premeds here are taking at least one gap year. Definitely something for you to consider. 

I chose Dartmouth because of the culture (not cutrhroat for  premeds like many schools are), classes, and research. Besides language, I have no regrets, and I'm really glad I chose Dartmouth. Best of luck with your decision!",3,,False,flq9chj,False,False,1585384693.0,2020-03-28 03:38:13

a concern from someone who comes from a big city,lousbiggreen,"So I'm from a little fishing village called Los Angeles, and while Dartmouth's location took a little adjusting to, it definitely has its charms. 

1) If you're seeking walkability, Dartmouth and Hanover definitely have it. The closest grocery store is admittedly a bit of walk (maybe 15 minutes) but everything you *need* is easily within like a 10 minute walk (mail services/basic restaurants/CVS/booze etc.). Not to mention that most of your basic needs are on-campus anyways. 

2) Thanks to the internet, it's easier than ever to get everything you could possibly want delivered. You might have to delay the instant gratification a little bit, but if you can wait two days for shipping, you can get almost anything delivered, short of perishable goods and explosives. 

3) Look, if you really want like Ethiopian food or something, we don't really have it. There's a decent variety of restaurants, but not nearly the variety in any metro area. To tell you the truth though, you'll mostly be eating in the dining hall anyways, even if you're rich. You'll be fine, it'll build some character.

For me, coming from a city, I did this comparison and this was it:

city: 

* going to the same 2-3 coffee shops
* concerts (big + small)
* restaurants with ethnic food
* fresh fruit
* fast food
* boba
* malls 
* movies
* driving

hanover:

* going to the same 2-3 coffee shops
* free, typically indie concerts (shout out friday night rock / programming board / coffeehouse concert series / house shows)
* thai/chinese/indian food (also a good viet place in west leb!)
* boba (though idk if our boba shop is closing)
* lots of hiking trails in NH
* climbing gym on campus
* everywhere is walkable
* you'll see people you know everywhere since no one leaves campus really
* occasional movie (telluride at dartmouth in fall is a hoot, the town movie theater is fine)

Yes, I would miss driving, fresh fruit, and getting to hang out at a mall, but I also get to do other things in more frequency and tbh, my lifestyle didn't change that much.

Hey all, I am part of the '24 admitted student class and I had some questions about the music at Dartmouth.

I am very competitive (to myself, I get along with my bandmates quite well!) about my progress on the instrument. I tried doing some research about the faculty and groups, but none of the information gave me a great understanding.

My questions are as follows: do the young musicians and faculty have an advanced level of knowledge (like Jerry Bergonzi level), passion, and connections so that I can happily continue to improve throughout my time there as an undergrad? Also, how are the arts received by the student body? How does the music compare to other schools?

Classmates tend to see each other as sources of help as they make the same journey, not competitors.

How competitive is the learning environment at Dartmouth?,,"Dartmouth is undergrad focused - so the values of the school itself are geared towards the development of each individual student. It's meant to provide an array of research, engineering, artistic, etc. avenues for students to get lost in. So it automatically attracts students who the school feels will utilize these opportunities. 

I think there is natural competition that arises in any school. However, I like that Dartmouth takes that inherent competitiveness into account and focuses on seminar style courses from the moment you're a Freshman. It encourages group activities and interactions. 

I got really into Sanborn's archives during my Freshman winter (fuck that weather) and met a lot of cool friends that way. I did a lot of research with a professor that turned into my thesis. It was pretty tight.

In addition, I managed to get myself picked up by campus security while drunk off my ass at the Hop (dining area when I was there - is the hop cafe still there??). I'd take... substances with friends and we'd go hang out at the golf course. 

This was all during my ""intellectual"" endeavors.

Is the undergraduate teaching all it's cracked up to be?,leadbunny,"I know I'm a little late to the party, but I figure I'd toss my two cents in the ring.  I just finished my BE this past winter and earned my AB last spring.  Most of what I have to say is really just echoing everyone else.  Just as a bit of background, I was premed and engineering, and I also did a minor in Asian and Middle Eastern studies, so I got a decent cross-section of campus.

The main thing I can say was already touched on by rekt_brownie, casualborker, and heyitsjoshco.  Every department has its gems, and your upperclassman friends will be your greatest resources for course selection.  When I say gems, I mean profs that can make you forget about the shitty profs because taking a class with them was such a joy that it's all ok.  They change how you look at the world, push you to think and apply knowledge better, and just make you happy to be enrolled.  Plan things right and you can usually have at least one gem per term.  That said, always ask people for their experiences and suggestions and read the published course reviews. Some departments definitely have overall ethos's though, and you can try to line up your D Plan so that you take the courses when they're offered by the best profs. I'm happy to give you names and suggestions/experiences if you PM me. :)

Other than that, the best advice I can give is to find the best advisors in your desired major/field.  Again, ask the upperclassmen and suss out who's who.  I've never really heard of a prof turning down a potential advisee, but it helps if you take a class or two with them because they'll be that much more invested in your success. But even if you don't, the really great advisors see their work as the chance to help someone set up their own future, not to get more people enrolled in their major.

I'm a Dartmouth College '20. AMA.,hexeter88,"To be honest, Dartmouth was barely on my list of potential schools when I was applying. I just shoved it in there because, why not have another option. Was one of the 3 Ivy's I applied to. Chose it over Brown, Duke, Wash U, Pomona, William&Mary, Williams, and a couple more.

I chose Darty when I came to dimensions and heard students talking about:

-Quarter system: Ten intense weeks of 3 classes (max 4) and then you switched courses. I liked how the turn over was fast, so I could get a course I may not love over with. But this also is one of the elements of Dartmouth that makes it so rigorous. The difficulty of academics really varies from term to term, depending on what classes (and what combination of classes you're taking).

-Study Abroad opportunities: Darty's study abroad is one of it's most appealing aspects to me. You get to go around the world with insanely accomplished and knowledgeable professors! You don't really get the same opportunity to do so outside of college and Darty does this well. Also, even Pre-med and engineering students go abroad; you can fit it in your 4 years!

-The size of the school was appealing because I didn't want to get lost in a sea of 50,000 students. And that ~student to prof ratio thooooo~! If you take the initiative and effort to do so, you can make some really great relationships with profs.

-The alumni connects. Dartmouth alumni love Dartmouth and they want to see them succeed. With that, there are a lot of internship opportunities and personal connections that you can make with alumni that I didn't sense at other schools. 

-Easy to get funding for a whole array of things: travel, internships, etc. I got funding to intern in SF my freshman summer. You just have to take advantage of the amazing resources we have. 


Major:
It took me a loooong time to figure out what I wanted to do, and I really only put it all together my last term (my 5th term here). Freshman year, I took a bunch of obscure courses in any department that I thought I might be interested in: Film, English, Socy, History, Cog Sci, Psych, etc. and then narrowed down what I seemed to like the most from there. I went for the departments in which I was most challenged to think differently, and the subjects that now come up in my day to day life. I did a lot of asking around of older students, seeing what departments were ""good,"" which profs were the best, and I landed here. 

Student Culture:

This one is pretty hard for me to answer, honestly. 
There is certainly a dominant student culture here that I don't personally mesh well with. Being someone who, to put it bluntly, doesn't give an F about how other students perceive me, I don't fall into a lot of the categories/groups that Dartmouth students tend to conform to. With that, Dartmouth is a very conforming place and this aspect of it is where I've found more the issues that I have with the school. 
Minority groups and marginalized identities often don't feel the most welcome, despite how the brochures depict this place. It is a predominantly white campus. Predominantly well-off families. Groups tend to self-segregate, though there is inter-mingling of course. These segregations don't really become apparent until you've been here for a while, and some people don't seem to notice them at all (but, like I said, I'm a very reflective person, and I'm pretty critical of institutions).

Greek life here is big. People say it's the only social scene at Dartmouth, and while it's true that it's the most visible, you can find alternatives. I know I have and I enjoy the vast majority of my time here. With Greek life comes all many negatives that I could not look past (thus, why I am unaffiliated). I could go on about this, but you didn't really ask about greek life and I don't want to make it sound like that's all that Dartmouth is. Seeing as so many of the students here are affiliated, everyone is affected by the greek system at least a little indirectly. But, you can avoid those spaces or participate in those organizations if you so choose. 

Everyone is very welcoming and friendly when you meet them. But, I remember struggling my Freshman year as I was frustrated how surface-level everyone was. I felt the connections I was making weren't deep at all, but rather out of convenience. I think this feeling is not uncommon amongst first-years, and probably beyond Dartmouth. I also remember coming here and being disappointed in how non-intellectual people were. I imagined college being sorta like an ancient greek symposium and that's not what it was. It wasn't until I found people of similar values and interestes that I started having the intellectual conversations that I wanted to be having on a day-to-day basis.

Despite the negatives, I have found many people I love and who have really transformed my life for the better and have established a little family of my own. I really do think you can make friends for life here, it just takes time and the right people. 

People are generally pretty ""laid back."" But the rigor of classes does catch up with people and that can take a toll in terms of how ""laid back"" they are. But, that doesn't mean they get cut-throat. Just stressed. 

I think that a lot of the problems I have with Dartmouth I would have had at any higher education institution. It is what you make of it. And in general, once you get settled, it's a good time. At least, that's been my experience. There are always things to be critical of, ways the school could improve, but I'm thankful to be here with these people and with these opportunities. 


Sports:
I am not a varsity athlete but I was in club field hockey. Depending on the sport, I think you can walk on D1 with relative ease. I almost walked on the varisty rowing team, but then decided against it. I think it is much harder to do so with other sports, though. There are a lot of club and intermural sports here that anyone can join; those have been pretty fun. There are a lot of Varsity athletes here and they manage to keep up with school work as well. It honestly really impresses me. I know I wouldn't be able to be a D1 athlete and still do well in school. There are some superhumans here.

I'm a Dartmouth College '20. AMA.,hexeter88,"hahaha Dude, don't stress too much! It's totally normal for you not to be ""doing anything"" your freshman summer. ""Doing something"" meaning internships or whatever. I personally did have an internship over my freshman summer, but upper-classmen would tell me ""woah, you're ahead of the game!"" 

My hometown has no opportunities even for simple summer jobs, so that's why I felt the need to do something more. 

If you still feel that you ~need~ to be ""doing"" something, applications for a lot of things are probably still open, though I don't know the exact dates. That being said, they're probably due soon. 

I got an internship through the Dartmouth Center for Social Impact. There are some really cool programs that go on in the summer through them. I would also suggest looking into the Dicky Center (for funding/programs) and Rocky. I know people who got funding for their own projects abroad. Also, if you are close with a prof or are really interested in what they do/research, you can reach out to them. You'd be surprised what can happen when you just talk to people.

Did I make the right decision to come to Dartmouth?,chaienthusiast,"I think you might be overthinking this a lot! It is totally normal to be nervous right now, especially with the announcement of the two term plan. There are so many different communities and spaces at Dartmouth, there is something for literally everyone. There are many intellectual spaces and MANY people who are way more focused on academics than Greek life, sports, partying, etc. As someone who is unaffiliated by choice, DO NOT let Greek life deter you. Both within and outside of the Greek system, there are some really freaking amazing people (and some shit ones, like that ‘24 accused of SA). You will find this at literally any school you go to, I promise. College is exactly what YOU make of it, and the student body of Dartmouth is incredibly diverse in terms of interests. While it may seem from a distance that the social scene is completely focused on Greek life, if YOU make the effort to find cool people outside of that scene, you ABSOLUTELY will be able to.
Also, be happy Dartmouth is opening at all.. some peer institutions are staying remote for their entire Fall/Winter term.

Would you be ok if you worked as a barista or waitress for a year, only to find that you’d still be doing your freshman fall virtually?

It's definitely more inclusive than you'll find elsewhere (e.g. you can walk into nearly any fraternity house on any given weekend night. No lists or anything like that). That being said, it's still somewhat exclusive-- by nature, all Greek life is somewhat exclusive. Some events, like formals, are invite-only. Lots of students rush and many join houses that they end up liking, but from what I can tell it's relatively common to not end up in your first choice house. It's also not uncommon to rush and not end up in any house at all-- I have several good friends who rushed and ended up dropping.

I think you can have either a good or bad experience with Greek life depending on what you want to get out of it. It isn't the stereotypical Greek scene and I think in many ways it's better/more relaxed.

>I don't love Dartmouth, wasn't brainwashed by Trips (although I enjoyed it), and I think it's fair to say Dartmouth has a lot of cultural and institutional problems related to student life. I enjoyed the article a lot. 

>But I think it's virtually useless as anything other than a window into what Andrew Lohse wants us to think about him. The administration's totally botched the hazing issue and Lohse's called attention to an important problem, but the article basically paints him as a martyr, whitewashes his behavior altogether, and parrots all of his beliefs about Dartmouth and its system.

>The tone of the article is such that one would be forgiven for thinking Dartmouth's a torture camp for anyone who isn't susceptible to brainwashing. But I think that although it's a not completely enjoyable experience, Camp Dartmouth is hardly torture, even for most people who dislike it. (Trips are where you get ""hazed into happiness""? Seriously?)

>It's definitely unfortunate but true that a lot of people at Dartmouth are motivated by buying into the elitist culture surrounding pledging and getting a sweet job, and this is a definite cultural problem. But it's hardly true that this is the case for most people at Dartmouth. Generalizing about Dartmouth from Lohse's experiences is problematic.

>As an alum I find this an interesting perspective that helps me think about my experiences at Dartmouth, but I would strongly recommend not relying on it as a fair representation of Dartmouth life or culture.

Rolling Stone -- Confessions of an Ivy League Frat Boy: Inside Dartmouth's Hazing Abuses,johnleemk,"The problem is the article is literally only from his standpoint. It parrots all his opinions and defends his character every step of the way. This is fine if the article's supposed to be about Lohse, but you're absolutely right -- it's not supposed to be about him. And that's a problem.

Lohse is distinctive for being the only person to come out and say he has personally witnessed/participated in hazing at Dartmouth, so any article on the hazing issue would have to focus at least in part on him. But the article makes him and his story the centerpiece. That's still justifiable, but in doing so, the article also went further and quite clearly excluded points of view which might detract from Lohse's story. The tone of the article suggests that any typical high school student is prone to becoming a coke-snorting, bitter torture victim if they choose to attend Dartmouth, just like Lohse. It suggests that even Trips constitutes hazing, which is simply ridiculous.

I'm not suggesting this article needed to give more credence to administration points of view -- IMO the administration was generally characterized fairly in the piece. But the article's failing is its failing to cover student points of view other than Lohse's. Students generally only pop up in the story when what they have to say supports what he has to say. That's not good or fair reporting.

To me, this article is interesting, but it's not the definitive piece on hazing at Dartmouth, let alone student life at Dartmouth.",3,,False,c46bhnj,False,False,1333042656.0,2012-03-29 12:37:36
Rolling Stone -- Confessions of an Ivy League Frat Boy: Inside Dartmouth's Hazing Abuses,johnleemk,"Introversion, as he/she said, is one part of it -- if you're introverted I think it is difficult to thrive in a campus setting like Dartmouth's. Likewise if you don't like drinking.

I'm a bit on the introverted side, but I enjoy drinking (even arguably binge drinking, to a certain point), and I liked a lot of the people I met at Dartmouth. The problem I had with Dartmouth is that the whole culture is not intellectual. I almost said anti-intellectual, but that might be going too far. Still, academic clubs/societies are not popular activities, and building your brand as a person around them marks you as different (in a negative way) from everyone else.

Now, I'm thinking as a male here, because I can't speak to what it's like for women -- the Dartmouth experience is still quite gendered. Some of what I say probably applies to women, but definitely not all of it (the female Greek experience sounds a lot less unappealing than the male counterpart). At Dartmouth, your brand as a male student is typically built around sex appeal and drinking, unless you subscribe to an alternative subculture (DOC, Phi Tau, etc.). For someone who isn't into any of those alternative subcultures, isn't popular with the ladies, and isn't a brother at a house, you don't really have much of a good brand, which makes meeting new people hard.

Superficiality is IMO going to be a hallmark of the college experience almost anywhere, even (especially?) in the Ivy League. But for a place which brings together relatively intelligent people from all over the world, it's surprisingly hard to find a subculture for people who aren't into defining themselves based on sex appeal/drinking ability, but don't love the outdoors (DOC) or nudism (Phi Tau). The closest I got to such an experience was going on an FSP. Maybe EW is something similar, but EW has an odd subculture all of its own.",8,,False,c46emkc,False,False,1333056953.0,2012-03-29 16:35:53

2. Almost 100% of the freshman go on trips. It’s highly highly highly recommended!!! If you’re afraid of heights, put that in the extra information section of the application and you’ll certainly be accommodated.
3. When everybody else does

4a) Dartmouth is small and like a family. It’s not the school that brings people together, it’s the shared experiences. So go do stuff and have experiences! As Gandhi said, it’s not important what you do but it’s incredibly important that you do it.

4b) helping others in class is the best way to get ahead yourself

4c) You’re working on your resume, but you’re also working on your eulogy. Nobody’s going to remember you for your ability to take 4 classes and study till the sun comes up. Nor is anybody going to remember you for your partying abilities. 

4d) It’s okay to grow out of things. I was super duper into partying, and now I’m only really pretty into partying. But I don’t kick myself for “wasting time” partying freshman year. I grew out of it and that’s fine.

2. Most go. It's so much fun. Def go. There are all kinds of first year trips. Some don't do any hiking. If you search the Dartmouth website you should find a list of the different types of trips.
3. In the pre-pandemic world, when you get on campus will depend on where you live and when your first trip ends. If you are coming from out of country or far away (west coast), you'll have your trip at the end of summer and then can move right into your dorm room. You'll then be there 1-5 days before orientation (chilling....alone...actually it's fine. I did that). If you are nearby, you'll have your trip earlier and then go home. Then you come back at the start of orientation. Orientation is a whirlwind of activity.

How’s pre med at Dartmouth? Want to ED cause I love the campus and the vibe,Drill4Destiny,"So I’m a ‘24 ED, but I’m also doing premed so Ik some of the resources they have, idk the actual feel of the classes tho. In terms of resources, they have pre-health advising, the Geisel school of medicine (which you can talk to professors at for premed research opportunities, and those look great on a med school app). 

The biggest thing they have, tho, (and what I’m most excited for) is a close location to and relationship with the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, which has the only Level 1 Trauma center in NH (there are only 3 in ~~all of~~ *northern* New England). What that means is that the hospital sees a TON of cases from hospitals all over New England. 

Hope this helps!",11,,1587521486.0,fo55l38,False,False,1587517998.0,2020-04-21 20:13:18
How’s pre med at Dartmouth? Want to ED cause I love the campus and the vibe,jammy69thicc,"These are my 2 cents on pre med at Dartmouth, as an alum. The advising needs more support, they’re helpful and it’s better than nothing but I’ve walked out of Parker house a handful of times with questions unanswered and sometimes feeling that if you did not have >3.6 GPA, or >515 MCAT, they are less willing to help you. However, through the Nathan Smith Society, you can get involved with shadowing each term, which will let you shadow doctors from different specialties.  BUT you have to attend a meeting and if you miss it you are unable to shadow that term so you need to be on top of your shit 

The proximity to DHMC is a plus, HOWEVER, gaining a volunteering position can sometimes be a long process, and starting training can take months. 

There are clubs you can partake in as a pre med which also provide opportunities for volunteering and clinical exposure abroad. There is no pre med major at Dartmouth, and the STEM classes are pretty tough and fast paced due to the quarter system so be wary of that with classes like orgo and biochem that tend to be more difficult. 

One of the things I enjoyed being pre med at Dartmouth was the cooperativity and lack of a cut throat competitive atmosphere. Students and professors will help you if you seek it and no one will put you down because “I need to get into med school also.” Also since Dartmouth really focuses on its undergrad community professors from the college, medical school, or researchers at DHMC are keen and excited to have undergrads partake in research and maybe get published. 

Dartmouth may not be most ideal pre med catered school, but it will definitely gives you opportunities and set you up for success with an Ivy League degree.",7,,1587520410.0,fo58lwi,False,False,1587519881.0,2020-04-21 20:44:41

How’s pre med at Dartmouth? Want to ED cause I love the campus and the vibe,GyanTheInfallible,"Well, in a given year, anywhere between 75-85% of applicants from Dartmouth will receive at least one medical school acceptance. Compare this to the nationwide average, which dances somewhere between 41 and 43%. The average Dartmouth student will receive three medical school acceptances. Note that three is the average number of *interview invitations* medical school applicants from across the country will receive. Dartmouth students achieve these results with an average GPA 0.07 points below and MCAT scores two points above their counterparts at other institutions. I suspect also that the list of schools to which the typical Dartmouth student applies, though, on average, longer than the lists of students elsewhere, consist of a higher proportion of elite medical schools.

Courses are stimulating. Professors are deeply engaged and will ensure you not only progress along the path you've chosen, but cultivate enduring interests in things you'd scantly heard of beforehand. If you're interested, there are myriad opportunities to perform laboratory and other research at a level above that at which you'd be expected to at comparable institutions with a larger supply of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. Additionally, there are several student-run groups which do charitable work in the Upper Valley, and they're always looking for support. The College will also back you if you have an interesting idea of your own and help to connect you with the appropriate resources. 

The NSS shadowing program, mentioned by another commenter above, is robust and well-organized, and Dartmouth Emergency Medical Services (DEMS) provides great exposure to basic EM work. The John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding sponsors the Dartmouth Coalition for Global Health, which puts on panel discussions and hosts heated debates about contemporary global health issues. GlobeMed and other clubs do charity work with partners abroad. The College and/or some housing communities will bring in a variety of speakers -- health economists, epidemiologists, physicians, dentists, nurses, &c. -- to present their work.

Unfortunately, I can't say much about Pre-Health Advising. I've good relationships with a few of the advisors there, certainly, and they've provided essential feedback on essay drafts and have helped me clarify, but I didn't use them for course-planning and I actively ignored most of their advice about extra-curricular activities, CASPer, &c. I thought it too formulaic, and it contradicted some of what I'd been told by other professors, by family in medicine and family who sit on admission committees at various medical schools (though sometimes these folks have offered contradictory advice too).

A lot of faculty on sabbatical or abroad will rent rooms in their homes, too, if you want something nicer/well maintained that’s not an insane price.

I'd stay away from Dartmouth's Sachem Village  unless you're a company-funded Tuckie, or a med student who is all-in regarding accepting massive debt.  The Field Road and North Sachem houses that are the [cheapest](https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/sites/realestate.prod/files/real_estate_office/wysiwyg/sachem_unit_matrix_2020-21_1.pdf) are not surprisingly also the worst... by far.  Everything else is shared-living at about $900+ per person per month.  So that's 34% of your stipend right there. Dartmouth clearly knows that percentage and just.does.not.care.

The best rental clearinghouse to check is [here](https://realestate.dartmouth.edu/upper-valley-rentals).

Also, take the time to see what your commute might be like in the morning and evening.  Coming in through the bridge from Norwich is pretty bad at certain times of days, and driving past DHMC from the south can be similarly painful.  Unfortunately, all the places where the traffic isn't horrible are where the rents are expensive.  So you kind of have to pick your poison.  


Also, there are certain legal ways to score a free parking pass, because Dartmouth's going to charge you to park your car as well.

Dartmouth’s call for diversity is a joke,Bicoidprime,"The year I started grad school at Dartmouth was the first year then-President Wright ""allowed"" grad students to qualify for the $5 Hop ticket price (now $10, after the Hop decided to claim they were too poor because of the 2008 financial crisis.)  In my first year, I became frustrated with all the Q-tips from Kendall mildy snoozing in the front rows of Spaulding, deadening the energy of shows.  

So the following summer, when the upcoming year's shows were announced, I made a giant calendar and invited everyone in my program to sign up.  About 20 people did so, which became about 400 tickets total!  That was all well and good, but the trick was that I went bought all the tickets under my account (everyone paid me back), which I upgraded to being a Hop Member.  The cost of that membership was distributed over those 400 tickets, so it didn't really cost anyone anything.  But being a member meant that we could pre-buy those good seats up front ahead of time instead of the Kendall crowd, plus all sit together in a chattering gaggle of energized students.  It was a ton of fun, and it helped people get to know one another.

I did this for a bunch of years until the Hop people got a bit tired of all of this, and changed the rules to the game a little bit.   It's now tougher to do what I did. 

My big picture point is that while I agree that Hanover can be a bit dull and white, grad school is about training you to be smart and creative.  Check the Valley News; look at what Cartoon Studies is doing; get on the mailing lists of shows in Haverhill and Royalton.

It was 40 degrees in Miami Beach today...,Deus-Ex-Logica,"Based on my experiences in cold weather, there are some things you absolutely need. None of this is hard to get: despite the memes, Dartmouth is cold, not Arctic.

Must-have:

* a waterproof and windproof jacket. If you want to (and can) shell out the big bucks, Arcteryx is the best option for this. But anything made of goretex will be more than sufficient. The important part is that it should be **completely impervious** to water, rain, and snow. The ability of this outer jacket to keep you warm is secondary, at best. In fact, I prefer one that has no insulation so that I can use it in all weather.

* a warm hat. Most of your heat will be lost in your head. Prevent this by getting a nice beanie. Sometimes organizations on-campus will give these away, but I wouldn't count on it.

* waterproof boots. In high snow conditions, most walkways get enough salt/plowing (most of the time) that you don't *need* need a boot. But you definitely want something that can withstand wind and snow. And if you want to go outside in storm conditions (which wouldn't be unusual, as you'll still need to go outside to eat) you'll want those higher ankles. Make sure to pull the legs of your pants *over* the opening so snow doesn't get in (instead of tucking them in). Many people find *insulated* boots useful. In my experience it just makes my feet sweaty, but I also tend to run hot. But you should at least think and decide if you want insulated boots.

* multiple layers of jackets. These don't have to be ultra-expensive whamadyne Canada Goose: I've had good success layering two or three sweatshirts or $20 Kirklands on top of each other in moderate conditions (and beneath that weatherproof outer jacket). This also has several advantages over a single jacket: you can lose one without catastrophe, and you can tune your layers to the exact temperature.

Good Ideas:

* thermal underwear. It lets you wear your usual pants (unless you like yoga pants or jeggings) while still being warm enough. And a surprising amount of heat gets lost from your legs. I enjoy.

* gloves. People think they can shove their hands in their pockets. They're not wrong, but you're still going to have to take your hands out to balance yourself, use your phone, and open doors. I find gloves are a very good thing to have just in case. Medium thickness is best for a wide variety of temperatures. If you can, get ones that work well with your phone and screen protector (some gloves wind up requiring ridiculously hard taps).

* down jacket. Canada goose is a meme. It works, but it's also a meme. Any down jacket can work, however, if it's ultra-cold and you need to really push through.

* a scarf, neck-up, or balaclava. Your face will get cold. Your neck will get cold. If you're outside for any length of time, invest in one of these. It prevents the wind from getting into your jacket from the neck or face. Ideally you want one with a relatively puffed-up fabric (like wool knit) so that when you breathe out into the garment, it spreads the hot breath all over your face.

The good news is twofold: you can look up cold-weather gear at an REI, LL Bean, or other sports store (but those two are the best); and you won't have to have the stuff in your possession until winter. You have all of fall to prepare (though once you come back from break, it's go-time).",16,,False,ffa656w,False,False,1579728633.0,2020-01-22 15:30:33

I want to transfer + what is going on with clubs/ at Dartmouth??,flutegirl2,"**To all of the '23s (and/or students of other years) who are questioning whether you belong at this school or not, I have but a few words for you: y*****ou do.*** 

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, there's another thing to keep in mind as you read responses to this thread: many of us upperclassmen can tell you all we want about our experiences at Dartmouth, but remember, these are *our* experiences -- **our experiences don't have to be yours too.** 

With that, I can only speak for myself as I respond to this thread. 

Dartmouth was not my dream school. Dartmouth was one of the many schools to which I frantically applied in the final days of December after receiving a rejection from -- what was at the time -- my dream school. For those of you who don't remember (or have blocked it out) the supplemental essay for Dartmouth paraphrases the famous Daniel Webster quote: ""*It is, sir…a small college. And yet, there are those who love it!”*  And in my college-application-induced delirium, **I cheekily responded to this prompt with ""it is not a small college -- it is a small home.""** And evidently, the college admissions officers smiled at that back at the time because I ended up with an acceptance letter in my hands that March. 

However, as my Dimensions host will tell you, I was not a happy prospi. In fact, I was probably the least excited prospective student in the history of prospective students: I didn't enjoy the Dimensions show; I was disappointed by the small size of the music department; and the cold, rainy weather matched my mood throughout the duration of the weekend. Even when I committed to Dartmouth, it wasn't really because I wanted to. (My relationships with people I loved were all over the place during this time in my life and I just wanted things to be calm again.) I couldn't have cared less about the Ivy League, but to my immigrant parents, my acceptance letter was a dream come true. 

Therefore, you could almost say that **Dartmouth found me at a time I needed to be found.** (Nowadays, whenever I'm having a particularly rough day, I like to touch my hand to the bricks of Rauner on my way back to my dorm and say a quick ""thank you for bringing me to a place that healed me."" Gratitude really does make the little irksome details seem so little.) 

But when I finally came to campus freshman fall, I had virtually no expectations. And because it's difficult for something to fail to meet your expectations when you don't have any at all, Dartmouth largely exceeded my (non-existent) expectations.

For that, I do have to give due credit to Dartmouth's random generator: I was randomly matched with an incredible Dimensions host (who is now one of my closest friends and favorite people on campus), I was randomly matched with a lovely first-year roommate (who is still someone I am close with), and I was randomly matched with a first-year trip section that really made me feel welcome and spawned another very close friendship. Not everyone is as lucky with these random generators (if it's any consolation, I had a terrible room draw number as a sophomore) and while there's not much you can do about the results of anything that is randomly generated, **remember that everything on campus is extremely impermanent**. You're only assigned to your first-year dorm for one year; you're only required to live with your first roommate for one year; you're only going to be in each class for ten weeks. **And that time will fly**. 

I know many of you have yet to experience this, but all the terms are so different. My personal favorite will always be the spring. My friends have probably heard me say ""I'm so excited for spring term"" so many times by now, but -- for good measure -- dear goodness, I'm so excited for the spring. (If you're curious as to why, well, the Green becomes flooded with picnic blankets; flowers decorate all the trees; and people tend to smile more. It's nothing short of beautiful.) There's also nothing quite like the jolt of ""woah, it's fall"" -- something has drastically changed -- as when you walk into Foco for the first time after summer term and it's full of noisy freshmen mobs rather than sophomores quietly studying. Each season has such a different feeling to it. 

Also, **as your classes change, so will the people you see on campus.** It'll be slightly less noticeable to you over your first year, but for those of you involved in groups with upperclassmen, you will feel this shift. **Some people will leave campus. Others will come back.** Many upperclassmen will gripe to you about the D-Plan and about how difficult it is to maintain friendships, but for this, I offer a more optimistic perspective: because people are constantly coming and going, it's never too late to make a new friend or ask someone to grab a meal. You may find yourself on campus at a time when it feels like all of your close friends are ""off,"" but I assure you, you will meet other people. **Your people are here. The culture of finding them never really goes away.** 

I will not deny that the Greek/party scene is, for a sizeable amount of students, where they find their people. However, a part of me also now understands why that number is as large as it is. **Our Greek system is very open.** Anybody can walk into a frat, play pong, throw some foam, dance. Anybody can rush. And even as somebody who was initially very anti-Greek, I have softened and found a place or two where I enjoy spending some time every once in a while. I even went as far as to rush (and drop rush) my sophomore fall. While I probably could've enjoyed my time as an affiliated student -- that just wasn't the hand I was dealt. And that's okay. Being unaffiliated has opened up so many doors: I have so much more time for other interests. 

I also want to make a quick plug about DBI: the Dartmouth Bystander Initiative is doing worlds of good. Rather than alienating the bystander, our sexual violence prevention program empowers them. I was recently in a class where we discussed the topic of ""when have we seen people intervene in situations that seem...off"" and I don't think I've ever left a class period so full of hope. People are doing this. We had so many stories to share. This is a culture I am proud to observe and be a part of. Some of my friends at other schools can't say the same.",16,,False,fajkujm,False,False,1576142943.0,2019-12-12 03:29:03
I want to transfer + what is going on with clubs/ at Dartmouth??,dragonfruitpapaya,"hey im a 23 too and these are pretty much the same exact thoughts i had about my freshman fall. it’s definitely not the college experience i thought i would have (so far, although it could change.) i was gonna say many of the clubs seem so... superficial? like they would definitely look good on resumes and maybe i would like to join later on, but I’d also like to join niche clubs like fucking anime club (im not into anime) or something similar. you know how in movies, they always have these weird clubs and equally eccentric members? i guess i was expecting more of those types of clubs which many of my friends at other schools are in. anyway, from my first term, ive learned that my college experience isn’t going to play out how i thought it would. maybe it still would’ve been different from what i expected even if i went to another school, but it’s still just ... :/ i don’t know. even the party culture is different. Dartmouth really is just different. I find myself caring about things i never cared for only to come home and realize that i actually don’t care and it’s just the environment. I love it here but i also hate it here. I did want to transfer, but I’ll stick to the rest of the year and see what’s good. I really feel fond of my school, but I don’t know if it’s the place for me.

I want to transfer + what is going on with clubs/ at Dartmouth??,ruanderful,"I think your complaints are all legitimate. I myself (‘21) have struggled with many of the points you brought up. But I would say that Dartmouth somehow changed a lot as I navigated my freshman year and as I left campus and came back over and over again. I guess this has to do with how you see campus and how you interact with the Dartmouth world. What I’m trying to say is that my image of Dartmouth and how I enjoyed it (or not) changed a lot over time. Also, what happened my freshman year is that many of my concerns and complaints were not shared by other of my fellow ‘21s. For example, I remember having not so great community in my freshman floor, but my friends who were living in the river wouldn’t shut up about how amazing their floormates/UGAs were. Another example, I was lucky enough to join extracurriculars that weren’t the main big ones (i.e acapella, DOC) but that still were a huge deal in making my life so much more enjoyable at Dartmouth, while I remember seeing friends that struggled with finding extracurriculars even through sophomore and junior year.
So, again, the problems you detected are all very real at Dartmouth and sure we could be doing better as an institution in so many aspects. But also I think that if you might be able to find out that not everything at Dartmouth is that “dysfunctional.” You might indeed eventually find great extracurriculars as well as find an academic niche for which you will have a source of professional development support, and so on. 

Quick thing about the CPD: I used to hate it a lot, for all right reasons just as a lot of other students hate it, but I recently found out that there are people working there that are really trying to make it better and are super eager to listen to how they can help us better. This is similar to other centers on campus as well.

I want to transfer + what is going on with clubs/ at Dartmouth??,pcharles23,"I’m a ‘22 and honestly I didn’t love freshman fall. I didn’t love my classes, wasn’t involved with very many clubs, and missed my family and friends from home. Yet now I love being a student at Dartmouth, and am so grateful I have the opportunity to be a student.

In my opinion, the greatest thing about Dartmouth is the people you meet while you’re there. Since you’re attending an Ivy, you are meeting super intelligent and involved people with many cool interests. Unlike the other ivies, Dartmouth is so small in that I feel like a member of a finite community with these outstanding people. I never thought I would meet so many people with such diverse and fascinating interests. Like, I wasn’t friends with any improve or acapella kids in high school, but one of my closest friends is involved with each and I love going to all his shows. My roommate is probably my best friend in the world, and I would’ve never met him if it wasn’t for Dartmouth. 

Building these relationships takes time. The people I hungout with freshman fall are not the same people I hangout with now. While some people “find their people” in the fall, the people I hungout with for basically the entire fall we’re just the first people I met. It wasn’t really until the spring until I found my really close friends.

My advice would be to give it until the spring, if you still hate it, if you aren’t excited about your future at Dartmouth when you leave for the summer, then at that point it would make sense to transfer. I remember leaving freshman fall and thinking “wow, this is it? This is all college has to offer me”.

I want to transfer + what is going on with clubs/ at Dartmouth??,tasukete_onegai,"Heyo, somewhat jaded '22 here to offer you a few words, because honestly, I felt the same way by Spring term, which was low-key one of the most traumatizing moments of my life because of how hellish moving out of Dartmouth was for me during finals season. Apologies if I get a bit ranty about my own issues with Dartmouth because honestly, this has been on my mind quite frequently, and I guess if anything, I  hope you know that you aren't alone in feeling this way, especially if you felt hyped about your college experience. More than happy to PM about this too because honestly, I find myself asking this question by the end of every term, which I can't tell if it's a bad thing or something totally normal that no one talks about because.... it's Dartmouth. 

First and foremost, I would not recommend that  you transfer for a few reasons. Granted, I don't know you and my reasoning may not align with your own values. Just trying to give my own thoughts and my own reasoning that keeps me at this school for the next 3 years. Mostly, I feel like a lot of the issues you raised are commonly found at other schools, though perhaps a bit more sporadically at some places. I'lll at least complement Dartmouth on doing a really freakin good job at marketing its campus, with programming and Dimensions and whatnot, despite the actual conditions being less than ideal at times. I've heard mixed reviews on the party culture of college, and while there may be colleges that have a less party-like culture, there are many more cases where I've heard party culture dominate the campus. Personally, I'm not much of a party-goer myself, and haven't really felt pressured into that kind of lifestyle due to the other communities that I'm a part of, like Christian Union. More recently, I discovered a wonderful little fraternity called Phi Tau where I regularly play Smash Ultimate and bake cookies. There are nice non-party communities on campus and I think it's more about knowing where to look. 

Another reason why I wouldn't transfer, as egotistical as it may sound, is the amount of clout that Dartmouth has in the real world. Granted, this may depends on what you want to study, but Dartmouth being part of the Ivy League in itself gives it quite a strong reputation and network in the outside world that I've personally found pretty useful and isn't easy to get access to on other campuses. The close relationship you can build with professors also is a major perk and has definitely given me opportunities that I've heard are a lot harder elsewhere. Additionally, it's just a well-known reputable college. Tbh, I'm low key enjoying some of that ""Oh my goshhhh, you go to Dartmouth?!?!"" comments from my mom's clients during winterim to boost my somewhat crushed ego from this past term :') 

In all seriousness though, Dartmouth really fuckin sucks sometimes and personally, I feel like I loved Dartmouth despite its crappy administration and mismanagement of soooo many things, that I can't believe it's supposedly a ""rich Ivy League school"". Like when one of your dorm buildings has rats and you don't tear down the building, what the fuck is wrong with you?

Anyways, to touch on some of your points, I totally agree on pretty much all of them, and unfortunately don't have too much coping advice, so just bear with me.

CPD office itself has been pretty useless for me (potential CS) major, which sucks and the Econ snake vibe is pretty strong, which is understandable because of $$. At the same time, college is pretty freakin expensive and finance is a pretty solid sector, so I don't fault people on doing that over their passions. I feel like a nice thing about Dartmouth's whole liberal artsy course load is being able to take classes in things you're passionate in, while also having financial security job-wise via CPD office because let's be real, the job hunt grind is stressful. They are somewhat useful in reviewing resumes, but the best use I got from their office was a workshop on how to use the Dartmouth Alumni Network, which I've found pretty useful and might help if you want more concrete advice beyond finance. 

The lack of outside resources is one of the many many downsides of being in the middle of nowhere, but I think there are opportunities for making art or talking to more interesting potential speakers than what is formally organized. Going back to an earlier point, I've had lots of positive experiences interacting with professors, and a lot of times, they aren't even teaching a course I'm a part of. Once, I just happened upon a prof's piece, thought it was cool, emailed him, and came to his office for like an hour to just geek out and talk. TEDx in the Spring was also pretty cool and sometimes, I just check my clogged up Blitz and find some random speaker that actually turns out to be good. 

GET ME OUT OF HERE THIS SUMMER. (re: a previous post I made) because hot damn, did I feel that whole fitting into a certain mold thing. However, this is definitely a universal experience at every college and whether you feel it or not, it's honestly just a lot easier to stop giving a shit either way. Don't get me wrong, I always end up falling back into the cycle every term and it's only when I finally leave this crappy little bubble that I come back to my senses of what I want to do and how I don't give a FUCK about what else is going on. Cue minor existential crisis and lots of calls to mom.

Sexual assault. . . yeah. I don't have too many thoughts on that. Not surprising that it's something the college could definitely do a lot better. 

Food situation at Dartmouth sucks and the sooner more food delivery apps come to campus and give us better options, the better. If anyone knows an alternative aside from Dominos, Snackpass and Instacart that delivers, please let me know asap.

On a somewhat? unrelated tangent in this very therapeutic rant, I can't stand the D-plan and I think it's part of the contribution to the mismanagement of clubs due to constantly shifting leadership and lack of consistent quality time due to weird off-term schedules. It didn't take me long to see that sophomore summer, study abroad, etc. are really just schemes to get students off campus due to Dartmouth's problematic overpopulation, and while some students enjoy it, I personally think the costs majorly outweigh the benefits of the ""sophomore summer"" experience. I'm technically an international student who's been to several countries and came to Dartmouth to be AT Dartmouth, not some other country which has almost 0 of the resources I came to campus for. 

Anyways, to end all of this, Dartmouth can freakin suck ass sometimes, and I think the whole 10 week sprint on classes makes it hard to keep up the whole ""passion"" about academics that people come into with. However, I don't think it's entirely a Dartmouth thing and more a college thing overall. I've definitely met a lot of passionate people during my time here, and I'd like that think that I care about some of the dope shit I'm studying. At the same time, I think it's hard to balance the course load here followed by maintaining extracurriculars while keeping your mind sane because Dartmouth really pushes students (beyond healthy levels in my opinion) and the Work Hard Party Harder culture is often a symptom of that. I know that's not the best, but it is what it is, and I think you should at least give it another term or two before taking the transferring route. Maybe try something new on campus or one of those random blitzes that show up idk. Best of luck",2,,False,fajjb3u,False,False,1576140608.0,2019-12-12 02:50:08
I want to transfer + what is going on with clubs/ at Dartmouth??,flutegirl2,"On a different note, I remind you that, at the end of the day, we're all students. Some terms are academically lighter than others, but others demand hours of work in 3FB, in the Stacks, at Thayer -- you name it. (One of my most defining moments of 19F was sitting in Novack watching the sunrise after staying up all night working on an assignment.) **You may find Dartmouth easy; some people do. You may find Dartmouth exhausting; some people do. Regardless of which viewpoint you identify with, you will likely still, at one point or another, find yourself in the library at late hours of the night.** It's inevitable, but that's okay! That's why we're here.

And, while I am not an econ major (nor do I plan on going into finance) I've gotten close with faculty in the subjects for which I do have passion, and that makes such an impact. While not all faculty will leave good impressions, there will be faculty who change your world.  Find those people. Also, I have come to love that our school is at a size where there are shared academic experiences. My friend who has a passion for comp lit has taken a CS class and can relate to the struggles of a CS major. Writing 5 is a universal experience. My math major friend still had to take a literature course and write papers. You will inevitably know courses (and their reputations) by number: Math 3, Math 8, Econ 1, CS 1, Engs 21, Jews 11, Physics 3, Astro 1. While it may feel like everyone and their mom is an Econ major, this feeling dissipates as you befriend and become close with people with drastically different academic interests as your own. I have a friend who came in as a physics major, bonded with me in a CS class, and now can't stop taking English classes about Shakespeare. Take an advanced class in a less-known department -- I promise you'll meet people passionate about things other than Econ.

On the OP's perspective on clubs, I personally agree: there aren't too many clubs that I actively want to join. **However, I take a lack of clubs that spark my interest as a hidden blessing: I have time.** I have time to go to the gym. I have time to sit at kaf for an hour and talk to a friend. I have time to *get enough sleep.* I have time to meet with a classmate and work on an assignment. This may be the only time in your life when you actually have enough time. **Don't join a club you think is lackluster -- find something you love. I promise it's here somewhere on this campus.** Maybe you'll find out that you love running. Maybe you'll take a CS class and want to join DALI. Maybe you'll decide to go learn how to roll a whitewater kayak with Ledyard one afternoon. These are things you can only do if your schedule isn't scheduled to the brim.

I came to Dartmouth having filled all of my extra time in high school with choir-related activities. I went to school, I slept, and I went to rehearsal. That's it. I was a four-year All-Stater in a state where that makes you rarer than a unicorn. (And it's pretty humbling that my proudest achievement prior to college means absolutely nothing to people here.)  But I wasn't keen on a cappella; there wasn't a HOP ensemble devoted to my preferred type of music; and I didn't want to take voice lessons. So I didn't join anything in campus related to this love of mine. Do I miss it? Of course. But am I also *so* thankful that Dartmouth *doesn't* have my dream ensemble? Yes, because I know I would've invested all of my time into it had it existed. Instead, **I've found other passions. Hopefully, you will too.**

Ultimately, at the heart of everything I've written about above, lies one fact that many of us often take for granted: **there are so, so many kind people on this campus.** Yes, part of what makes it so easy for us to interact so freely with one another are our shared common experiences: the thirty-minute kaf lines, the ten-week terms, the jargon with which our language is filled (LSA, FSP, blobby, FFB, shmob, layup, sophomore summer, 19F, trippee, prospi, it goes on and on), the foliage, the snow, the flowers, the pains of living in the River or the Choates or the Lodge, the Baker bells at 6 PM. But at the end of the day, **what brings us together is the fact that we care about one another.** (Like anywhere in life, there will be people for whom this does not hold true. Don't fill your life with these people.) Find people who will come work on an assignment with you at 3 AM. Find people who will always have your back. Find people who will remind you to take care of yourself at times when things inevitably get hard. **Be that person for others.**

For those of you who went on trips, remember the line they sing at the Lodge: *Dartmouth's lucky to have you.* I cannot put into words how true this is. **Whoever you are, if you are here, it is because we are lucky to have you.** Part of the reason so many people stay involved with First-Year Trips is because yes, many people become jaded (like anywhere) but Trips is a time for us to remember why we love this place.

**We love this place because of the people we share it with.**

Everything else seems relatively trivial when you remind yourself on a day-to-day basis that you are surrounded by a loving community -- a community that will stay with you far beyond the year you graduate. **You are not alone here.** That's truly such a gift.

**Until then, remember: this isn't a small college -- it's a small home.** As with any home, while there will be things for which you love it *in spite of,* there will also be things for which you love it *because of*.

Which you choose to focus on is ultimately up to you.

I want to transfer + what is going on with clubs/ at Dartmouth??,ruanderful,"I would say yes. Of course in different ways and to different degrees. Some of the problems we experience at Dartmouth can be mostly specific to our campus, for example. But in general I feel that people tend to enjoy college more as they go because you progressively learn how to deal with everything properly, you build stronger relationships, and I guess you just start seeing several things differently.
With that said, I think it’s important to reiterate that some problems we have on campus, very unfortunately, might not go away soon. Some can be dealt with more easily than others (i.e. limited dining halls vs. sexual assault), and if the more complicated ones represent pressing issues to you, then transferring should actually be considered.

"Playing ""Catch-up"" With More Competitive Students?",AsteroidTicker,"Hey man, you are going to be fine. Remember that some of this kids have been raised to get into schools like this, and you still ended up in the same place as them. That says a lot about who you are.

 In terms of competition, Dartmouth is generally not a super competitive or “rat-race-y” environment. You’ll get a few dicks here and there but in my experience any “competition” you see is people just trying to prove they’re smart enough to be here. It comes from a place of insecurity. 

Remember that once you get to college, a lot of what you did in high school begins to become less important. So don’t worry about the things you and others may or may not have done in HS. There are tons of opportunities open to you, so don’t be afraid to step up and take them, you deserve it just as much as anyone else. 

Of course, realistically some things are more difficult to get into than others. You won’t get everything, but the more you try out, the more likely you are to find something. Look for smaller programs and opportunities that might not be as well known. Ask your professors what their research interests are, take them to lunch and talk about their work with them, those kinds of things. Make meaningful connections.

In terms of “catch-up,” I’d say one the best things you can do for yourself is to focus on your general study skills. Lots of the “smartest” kids just don’t have them and they’re damn hard to pick up some times. Learn to manage your time, figure out a way to study that works for you, etc. There are some places on campus that can also help with these things. Take advantage of that! Second, if you’re struggling, go to office hours. Your professors are here to help you learn and help you succeed. There are no stupid questions and any prof that makes you feel otherwise is shitty and ought to be flamed when evaluations come around. 

One wall of text later (sorry about that) I just want to emphasize that you absolutely deserve to be here, so don’t let ANYBODY make you feel otherwise.",11,,False,eibto01,False,False,1552360839.0,2019-03-11 22:20:39
"Playing ""Catch-up"" With More Competitive Students?",rekt_brownie,"Here’s a big secret: they’re not superhumans. Yes, many of the students here are well off and probably have a lot of educational advantages but there’s nothing that makes anyone here inherently better than anyone. Realistically no one knows what they’re doing, you guys are just about to start college, and most grads don’t know what they’re doing. 

I think what it really is, is that some people get a bit of a boost by going to prep schools and whatnot, and that may show in intro classes. All the same, it’s not such a large gap that you can’t catch up. You come to Dartmouth to learn, after all. 

Finally, don’t worry too much about comparing yourself — it’s a terrible trap. Try to focus on personal growth more than anything, because there are always people that are better than you. You’ll meet crazy people that have done ridiculous things, but that should have no bearing on you or make your accomplishments feel smaller.

Dartmouth grad who is also best friends with a former Dartmouth admission officer AMA,dmouth_a_guy,"I think most people are really only involved with clubs freshman year but not so much afterward. I wouldn't say there is like really popular clubs everyone is a part of as a lot of clubs are based on interests which obviously vary. The club sports teams are pretty active for people who may have been varsity athletes in high school but didn't want to be an athlete in college. 

I think clubs that are based on identity are popular. I think groups that are based on career opportunities like Dartmouth investment and philanthropy are also popular among people interested in finance and investment banking. 

Basically, if you have some interest odds are a club exists for it. If a club doesn't exist for it you can make one and get funding for it.

The unique parts of Dartmouth are its small size and focus on undergraduate education. I think that this is something that is often touted but is true but the small undergraduate focus is amazing. Most of the professors at Dartmouth are from top schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford etc. so they know what those schools are like as an undergrad and due to their size it's more like a factory model where undergrads aren't really valued (according to most of them). At Dartmouth you can actually hang out with professors, do research with them etc. and they won't be dismissive of you (by and large). I obviously can't really compare to other colleges but the alumni network at Dartmouth is very strong. If you wore Dartmouth swag in some random city odds are you would run into another Dartmouth person and a convo would ensue. I think alumni are also genuinely interested in who you are and your time at Dartmouth. I think a lot of this passion from Dartmouth comes from the fact it is a smaller sized campus and more tight-knit and a place where you can always find your niche.

Dartmouth Freshmen Courses,5thWonder,"I might be misunderstanding you, but Writing 5 is mandatory unless you apply to the humanities class instead.

Writing 5 is really broad, some are really hard, some are really easy, and they shouldn’t at all be your basis of how the typical Dartmouth class is.

I personally took a really easy one with maybe 15 pages of writing total over the term, but my friends had some where they had to write around 50 pages total.


Anyways, other cool classes you should take freshman year are CS1, Psych 1, Engs 5/6 I’d you aren’t an engines major, Econ 1, Gov 5, etc. Basically any intro course is interesting and has the possibility of making you want to major in that dept.

But a ton of my friends took either class and ended up falling in love with the respective subject, and at a bare minimum, both teach useful ways to think and look at the world. I wouldn't take them freshman fall, but definitely freshman winter and spring.

For reference, I took CS 1 and fucking hated it (now I know), but having a basic ability to code has really helped me with jobs and research. I took ECON 1, absolutely loved it, and that's how I picked my major. 

Also really recommend Religion 1.01: What Matters, and have heard really good things about Phil 1.05: Reasons, Values, Persons, which is a similar course in the Phil department. Rel 1.01 really helped my crystallize what I wanted out of life, and I found a lot of the lessons applicable to leadership and rallying people.",8,,False,fovqdfh,False,False,1588105713.0,2020-04-28 15:28:33

I'd recommend seeing what department they're in since you could start an early connection with a prof through the class. Layup List is a good resource for seeing potential workload too.

ENGS 12: Design Thinking is one of the most fascinating courses to take. It requires a lot of work as a purely project-based class, but nearly everyone who I know who has taken it has said it was their favorite class of all time and the principles of design thinking are super useful regardless of your major. CS 1 is another fun popular course to try, and while it can be challenging, there are lots of TAs and tutors to help if you get stuck on labs or understanding the concepts. 

I'm not 100% sure if/when it'll be re-offered, but Video Games and the Meaning of Life with Professor William Cheng has got to be one of my all-time favorite classes.

Getting cold feet,1251throwaway,"Harassment at Dartmouth is a lot more complicated, because frankly, with a closed, generally isolated community, everything can be simplified from the outside or even (though I hate to say this) exaggerated. 

With coming to Dartmouth from outside the U.S., as one international friend once said, the racism hits you all at once. It's not overt or intentional most of the time; there are kids here that come from small, white-majority towns, and they may never have known how to be sensitive to the cultures of other people. That's not necessarily their fault, but it's pretty jarring to come from a country/area where your ethnic background was the majority, while other students from diverse cities in the US have been used to this because they've grown up as the minorities their entire lives. 

As for sexual assault/harassment, one thing you might not realize is that to my knowledge, there is no school out there that is being lauded for how it handles sexual assault. It's an issue on campus, as it is on almost every campus. Any campus that says it isn't an issue is just hiding it/trying to look good for the public. The least that I can say is that with the Sexual Violence Prevention Project, the unified sexual harassment policy that's now meant to protect faculty and staff, and the extensive sessions on bystander interference, Dartmouth is trying. I've spoken to the administrative staff that's working on the project, and they're actively taking student feedback after all the sessions, compiling it, and are working on continuing to expand it.

I’m a ‘20 at Dartmouth. AMA,hexeter88,"This was tough for me. You get paired with an academic advisor (just a prof that can help you pick classes). Idk how they assigned who you would meet with to discuss course selection, but my prof was in a department that didn’t know anything about what I wanted to study. If you get a good prof (one relevant to what you’re interested in) they can help.

It all comes down to your own research I’d say. I’d suggest:

-read through all the classes offered in the fall in the catalog

-try to learn about profs. The prof of a class can make or break your learning experience. This is always what I prioritize. If they are good at teaching, inspiring, and passionate about students, you can get interested in just about anything they’re teaching. 

-ask upperclassmen for suggestions!!!!. Trip leaders, UGAs, any mentors you get paired up with. They will know the reputation of profs, classes, and departments. They have experience that is very valuable. 

-keep your interests in mind! 

-keep prerequisite classes in mind if you have your mind set on higher level courses in a department

-walk in hours with an academic Dean in the deans office could also really help if you’re lost

-read the course reviews online,  although these are often not up to date 

-keep difficulty balance in mind. I would not take three hard classes in a term. That’s just asking for trouble, especially freshman fall. There will be a lot you have to adjust to and being overwhelmed by courses due to poor judgement is not something you want to deal with.

Also, in terms of freshman writing 5 and seminar, I was given the advice to pick something based on a distributive requirement that I thought would be difficult to fulfill otherwise. That’s one strategy. Or you can go for the best prof in a sept you’re interested in. Or just topic.

I’m a ‘20 at Dartmouth. AMA,imsoawesome11223344,"Not OP, but a lot of people pretty much have to take certain things. If you're in a Writing 5 in the fall, thats one of your classes. If you don't place out of language, most people take language 1,2,3  freshman year so that's one of your classes. I know a lot of people took their math distrib with either Math 3, 8, or 11 freshman fall. If you aren't interested in being a math major or  a major with one of those classes as a prereq, I'd suggest taking an intro course in something that you're interested in majoring in, or just interested in general. It's very easy to get to the end of your freshman year and have only dabbled in a few things.

She was nice, but not in the least bit helpful in the end--I picked my classes based on my interests. I went to Dartmouth with the intent of majoring in Government and then going to law school. My 1st year advisor said I should consider that people often change their minds and maybe take other classes. I went to law school. Am lawyer. So that advise wasn't really useful for me!

I'll also agree that you should definitely scope out professors. No more how good the subject is, or how exciting the syllabus, /u/hexeter88 is absolutely right that the professor makes or breaks the class. I only had one truly awful professor (freshman Fall when I didn't know any better). One or two meh professors. The rest were fantastic.

Oh, and definitely consider the timing of classes-my other mistake from freshman fall. As a night owl, picking a M, W, F class at 9AM on the far side of campus was rougher than I needed to make my first term.

The house system is one of those ""choose your own adventure"" type deals. There are some people who get super involved, and go to all the events; my house does dinners at the prof's place, a couple trips here there to Six Flags and the like. The vast majority of people in my year at least didn't really do anything with the house communities; I've attended like three house events, two of which were mandatory.  

To tell you the truth, because houses are randomly generated, they don't really have cultures or personalities in the same way that greek life/clubs/LLCs do; greek life/clubs/LLCs are self-selecting, and consequently develop cultures because they have like-minded people. Each house is just generally representative of Dartmouth as a whole, at least by the numbers. 

FWIW, the school is really trying, and spends shitloads of money on the house system, and I'd strongly suggest you take advantage of it. I think a lot of students are just kinda resentful cause they see it as a waste of money and they see it as restricting housing choice; most of my friends were outside of my house, and we couldn't dorm together even though we wanted to. Also, once kids get involved in clubs/llcs in freshman year, and greek life in sophomore year, houses generally stop mattering outside of housing.",15,,False,g2cq0di,False,False,1598035214.0,2020-08-21 13:40:14

Questions about House System,FUNNYLOLO,"'23 here who is actively involved with the leadership team of one of the houses.

All other responses are very insightful, but I thought it would be good to provide you with an alternative perspective from one who is not only heavily involved the its programming but also has had extensive experience with the organizational structure of the housing system. 

To tell you the truth, I was a bit skeptical and confused when I  first got assigned my house too. Like you, I immediately set out to do some research on the different houses but came to the disappointing conclusion that residential houses really don't play a huge part in campus culture. 

After arriving on campus and participating in some of my house's events (free dinner party, NYC excursion, and superbowl party), however, I began to change my perspective. In my opinion, the presence of the residential house system doesn't just have to be an ""alternative social space"" to the more dominant greek scene. In fact, it has the potential to invoke a sense of belonging and community. Of course, many upperclassmen still see the system as a ploy to undermine the frats. There are signs that this sentiment is becoming less and less prevalent as new generations of Dartmouth students come in. 

Personally, I made a solid group of friends who are proud of our house and passionate about making the housing system more viable.

"Math 11, Math 9, or Math 13 ??",GyanTheInfallible,"Welcome to Dartmouth!

Math 11 is what’s typically taken by those who’ve completed Calculus BC in high school and received a 5 on the AP exam, but who’ve not done any additional mathematics. It’s essentially Math 8 and Math 13 combined and is challenging for that reason. 

As you’ve already taken multivariable calculus, I’d speak with Scott Pauls or someone else at the department to start with Math 13. The content will be more stimulating than if you had also to review the Calculus BC concepts covered in Math 11, and the pacing should be to your liking.",8,,False,fzy8e02,False,False,1596252523.0,2020-07-31 22:28:43

"Math 11, Math 9, or Math 13 ??",jajefan,"Hi! '23 who took Math 13 (during F19) here. Would recommend only considering Math 11 or 13, as 9 is exactly like Math 8 except series (covered in BC) is replaced with an intro to linear algebra (and BC kids usually don't take 8 unless they struggled in BC).

I also took Multi in high school, starting with basic vector calculus, moving to partial differentiation, line integration, and multiple integration, and ending with green's, stoke's, and divergence theorem. This was at a normal semester-based calendar college course, so around 15 weeks or so with 2 midterms and 1 final exam.

Math 11 essentially takes the above course and compacts it into 10 weeks, so it is definitely not for the faint of heart, though considering you have taken the course already, much of it will be review/refreshing your memory for these concepts (and if you did well in your HS multi class, then you'll do well in Math 11 as well).

Math 13 begins around partial differentiation and ends at around the same place that Math 11 does, so you get to dive into much more detail and spend more time with each of the smaller concepts in partials, integration, and all the theorems. I liked this format more, especially since all the vector calc stuff comes back up when you learn about the theorems.

To be honest, I felt like the second time around going through this stuff made much more sense than the first time since I had more time to focus on the meaning of the formulae and theorems instead of just memorizing them (though this can be synonymous for some). My personal recommendation is to take Math 13 given your background, but I'm sure you'll do fine in either course that you choose.",5,,False,fzyfmzy,False,False,1596257523.0,2020-07-31 23:52:03

Questions about drinking culture at Dartmouth,ozydaman,"There probably won’t be much direct pressure on you, an individual, to drink at any given time. No one cares whether you have a beer or not when you go out. But the mainstream social scene does revolve around drinking in frat basements, so there can be an implicit pressure to drink in order to fit in with that scene. The culture also encourages binge drinking, which can lead to people becoming much heavier drinkers than they otherwise would. “On nights” are usually Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and the amount you’ll drink that night really varies a lot from person to person — some people won’t drink at all, others will easily have 10+ drinks on a Saturday night.

What are some of the good and bad things about Dartmouth?,littleglazed,"it’s isolated as fuck. that was the biggest negative for me. but i’m a city person

if you like nature and outdoors stuff it’s pretty awesome. it is very gorgeous.

quarter system is brutal in terms of workload and pacing, i struggled with constant feeling like i had just gotten into the groove of a class then it was finals time.

but then again you only have to endure 9-12 if you end up not liking a class/whatever. 9 courses a year also mean more chances to explore a variety of subjects, which i really liked

it really did feel like undergrads had 100% of the colleges attention and resources, starting from of professor time, materials in classes, etc. it might be like that at other ivies as well, but i imagine its harder to find at a place with a heavier grad focus or just a larger student body. if you want something, chances are you’ll get it, as long as you make some effort. 

on-campus jobs even—example unrelated to academics and im not proud of this but i was bit immature and very depressed and maybe made it to my part time job 50% of the days...no one gave a fuck lol😭 you just say “sorry i’ve been swamped with work lately” to professors/whomever and they would just give an understanding nod

social options are hella limited, but ppl seem to form close bonds because of it. just gotta find your ppl",6,,1591719942.0,fthmqx0,False,False,1591719706.0,2020-06-09 11:21:46
What are some of the good and bad things about Dartmouth?,seatto2023,"similar to littleglazed but I have a different view of the same things. but ah I'm a white male though I'm not into the frat scene.

it’s isolated as fuck. that was the biggest positive for me. I hate cities and love, love being surrounded by nature. I love little towns too.

Nature and outdoors stuff is so awesome. Outing Club is huge. So many activities every week. And so many fun subclubs

quarter system is like drinking from a firehose. I love it. So fast changing every day. Many classes (ok not all) were fantastic and profs really interesting. I mean yeah definitely got stressed out and miserable at times, but so does my sister and she's on semesters.

undergrads have 100% of the colleges attention and resources. That's real. Lots of money for research and creative ideas.

Easy to get research job on campus and that led to a summer job for me.

I don't personally find the social options limited, but I found a close group in the cabin & trail and other subclubs and formed tight bonds with my LLC. I don't have enough time to partake of all the social options that I'd like. I don't go to the frats that often as my free time is taken up with clubs and sports. You can get to the Boston easy enough. I went to Boston and NYC during frosh year and I think I'm done with that for awhile. Too much other stuff to do IMO.

The big party weekends each quarter are awesome.

D-plan give you so much flexibility. Everyones path is different.

a negative but not specific to Dartmouth. finding a social group was hard fall of frosh year. I tried to push myself to join lots of different social groups, but I ended up with groups who I didn't vibe with and I felt lonely and really out of place plenty of times. But by middle of winter qtr, I'd found good groups and made friends. If I hadn't found my ppl, it'd be sad because D is so like extroverted. Maybe reach out to students who have similar interests and backgrounds to find out what social groups they were part of.",5,,False,ftixrig,False,False,1591742346.0,2020-06-09 17:39:06
What are some of the good and bad things about Dartmouth?,fettywapwapwap,"I ED’ed and am an international South Asian ‘24. 

While I can’t speak about the on-campus experience because, well, I haven’t been on campus as a student yet, I will say that I personally feel empathy is taken very seriously around here.  

From the tens of zoom calls, fb group interactions, and the one time I visited Dartmouth’s campus in 2019, I can tell you that the cut-throat environment you’ll notice at other top-tier schools doesn’t really exist here. 

Keep in mind that I was an intern at UPenn in the summer of 2019 and literally hated the environment there. People will do literally ANYTHING to trample all over your success at Penn and schools like it. 

At Dartmouth, however, I felt none of that. To quote a very surface-level interaction as backing, I’ll tell you about the time I stayed on Dartmouth’s campus as a visitor and had a bunch of girls and guys help me pick up luggage I was struggling to carry. It doesn’t sound like much but if you’ve ever been at another school where kids ignore everyone other than the people they know/have work with like I have, you’ll realize just how amazing Dartmouth is. 


As for the cons, the sexual assault statistics scared the living shit out of me as a woman of color until I realized at most places, it was way worse.

I wouldn’t let the sexual assault stats scare myself if I were you. 

As irritating as it is that men get to be as reckless as they want, I feel like a lack of vulnerability which comes from drinking heavy amounts, is definitely avoidable. 

Now, I’m not saying women get assaulted just because they’re drunk. I’m saying if it does happen (and it has happened to me at another top-tier school whilst sober) you’ll be in a much better position to defend yourself.

Dartmouth Freshmen Year,GyanTheInfallible,"Congratulations on your admission!

All first-year students must complete the Dartmouth writing requirement. This typically requires two terms and takes the form of a themed introductory intensive reading course (“Writing 5”) followed by a separate, potentially differently-themed introductory seminar (“Writing 7”). These courses are taken consecutively, either Fall-Winter or Winter-Spring, and each is capped at 16 students. A list of previous Writing 5 offerings can be found at https://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu/teaching/guidelines/writ-5-course-descriptions and includes such courses as “Philosophy and Climate Change” and “Hooking up, Going Steady and el Desamor: Post-Modern Sexualities in the Americas. A list of previous FYS offerings can be found at https://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu/teaching/guidelines/first-year-seminar-course-descriptions and includes such courses as “Fact or Fiction? Politicized Topics in Biology” and “The Future of Food.”

The terms in which you’ll complete yours will be decided for you (though you’ll get to pick the courses themselves!), unless you apply to and are accepted to complete the substitute sequence, Humanities I and II, which is offered only Fall-Winter. More information on this sequence, which I completed and loved, can be found at https://www.dartmouth.edu/hums1-2/. Importantly, you could choose to complete Humanities I and then take a traditional writing seminar instead of Humanities II, but most will stay with the sequence, and you’ll make some great, lasting friends.

Yet another option, for those not confident in their reading/writing foundation, is the three-term Writing 2-Writing 3-First-Year-Seminar sequence. I don’t know much about it, but there’s some information at https://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu/curriculum/writing-courses/writing-2-3. You work with a specialized TA in addition to your professor and classmates to develop your skills. It’s offered Fall-Winter-Spring.

There are no other courses freshmen are required to take, but some good ones, no matter your prospective major, are Math 3/8/13, Math 10, Biology 11, Economics 1, Sociology 1 and Chemistry 5/6. I can give more information on those if you’d like, or connect you with people who can, as I didn’t opt to take all of them myself.

Keep in mind you will still have to complete distributive (breadth) requirements, PE requirements and pass a swim test to graduate. That can be done whenever though.",7,,1586811213.0,fnb8ejl,False,False,1586811022.0,2020-04-13 15:50:22

I think it's very likely that a lot of those friend groups based on attractiveness are not as tight-knit as they appear from the outside, and may very well prove to be shallow.

After the school offered to get the external investigator on the conditions that she stop her hunger strike, I thought they gave her what she wanted. I was confused why the hunger strike kept going past that.

To be honest, I think this would've happened way faster if she just started her hunger strike two weeks after when she did start it. The week she started it had too many high-profile issues going on, with the black alumni letter, COVID issues, and sports teams getting cut.  If she waited a little bit, she wouldn't have had to fight as hard for the attention she deserved",4,,1596959040.0,g0veglr,False,False,1596958345.0,2020-08-09 02:32:25

"Can someone explain D-Plan, how it works, and what are the advantages?",joineradept,"Any term that is not listed as ""in residence"" is a term where you have a bit more what you do. Dartmouth requires that students be on campus for freshman and senior fall/winter/spring, and sophomore summer. From the remaining 8 terms that are available (freshman summer, sophomore fall/winter/spring, and all of junior year) you have to pick 5 of those to be ""in residence"" terms where you're taking classes. Most often that involves being on campus, but College-sponsored study abroad/transfer term programs can also count as a ""residence"" term as long as you're taking courses for credit.

In your leave terms, some students either work or find an internship, or do what I've been doing and take advantage of College-offered programs that don't involve taking classes and so don't count as a residence term. You're really free to do most whatever you want, though; you just can't do anything that would count as course credit. If you're looking for an opportunity for a leave term, the College does offer a lot of resources to help you get started, but a lot of the digging is going to be done on your own and based on what you're interested. There's no one path for finding something for your leave terms, and I personally have been on both ends of the spectrum of ""research trip halfway around the world"" and ""full-time research in Hanover in the middle of the winter.""

As for clubs, most clubs seem to operate in termly modules, but the flow of their operations is uninterrupted by the D-Plan. At least for the clubs I'm in, club leadership is either selected based on who's on campus for that term (note on campus and an ""in residence"" term are not always the same thing depending on leave-term on-campus research opportunities), or it is selected annually and the ""board"" of active leaders rotates term by term. This helps ensure that there's some kind of smoothness in each club's leadership. If you're just looking for club participation, you decide what you want to do for extracurriculars on a term-by-term basis so you don't commit for more than you're scheduled to.

Overall, people on campus seem to find their own ways to take advantage of how unique the D-Plan is, but they are also **very** understanding of how it messes up other parts of college life, especially socially as you may go several terms without seeing someone on campus because of differences in D-Plans.

I also do want to mention one more way in which D-Plans have not been the most convenient thing I've had to work with. You set your first draft of your D-Plan during your freshman spring (which I haven't heard of anyone's not getting approved), but you declare your major (including your plans for what classes you're taking and when) in your fifth term of residence which is some time during your sophomore year. In a sense, both your D-Plan influences what classes you can take when, and the classes you're interested in taking may influence your D-Plan depending on when they're offered. It's possible that when you begin to outline your major(s) track, you may only have 1 or 2 opportunities to take a particular course, and you have to make sure your D-Plan agrees with that.

But overall, the D-Plan is the driving force behind why the Dartmouth educational experience is unique. Dividing the year into 4 opportunities to take classes instead of the regular 3 gives you the opportunity to hone in on fewer courses at a time (to match the course load at a semester school) while offering the freedom to explore other experiences more or less whenever you want and not feel locked into only branching out of school during the summer. Plus, I hear sophomore summer is one of the best experiences most people have at Dartmouth, wouldn't know about that though because the world decided to have other plans this year :)",13,,False,fstj474,False,False,1591239421.0,2020-06-03 21:57:01
"Can someone explain D-Plan, how it works, and what are the advantages?",Littlelyon3843,"Definitely a unique aspect of Dartmouth. The flexibility is nice and in theory it’s easier to get job opportunities in terms other than summer because there is less competition.  

You start classes later in the fall (though not as late as you used to) and end later in the spring than other colleges. Done with fall term by Thanksgiving and then you have until early Jan off. 

Terms are intense because you only have 10 weeks for the classes you’re taking. Two rounds of midterms and a final is pretty standard and the profs move quickly. 

You end up moving a lot and get really good at packing. 

You do miss seeing people. Spring term was the only term I was on campus Junior year and as a result I don’t know many people in the year below me bc I was off and then they were off. But you make new friends and expand your circles and it’s fine.  

Also means you might be on and taking classes for awhile. I was on all Soph year and then straight in to Soph summer and was pretty burnt out by the end. 

You can’t rush until Soph year. Fall is the main rush term and then a smaller Winter rush term is held for people who were off during fall term. 

People will also take off terms and stay in Hanover (known as the Hanover FSP). Soph Summer (or Camp Dartmouth) is amazing.

"Can someone explain D-Plan, how it works, and what are the advantages?",joineradept,"Yeah, social communication is a bit weird. Luckily freshmen are all on campus for their first three terms together so you have some time to find friendships among people in your class - who you'll also be on campus with your senior year. On average you have about 3/4 of students on campus per term so that's also a pretty good way to meet people outside of your class (sophomores will probably stick around for at least 2 of those terms because of the summer requirement). I've mostly gotten to know people that come and go from the clubs I'm part of, and I've never been too attached to any of the people I've lived on the same floor as but that's also an option. I will say that I'm a pretty introverted person though, so I can't speak to exactly how the process works for more outgoing people. There is just the rare case that you don't see someone you've gotten to know well for two to three terms, which with how fast Dartmouth classes move feels like a lot longer.

Winter Wear/Clothes to Bring?,not_palindrome,"Californian here! I was just as worried as you last year.

I'd say if fall term is on, first priority is to buy a rain jacket and bring with you. It rained our first week on campus. Might also want some rain boots, but I survived with Vans while dodging puddles. I know this might not be what you think of first, but the most you'll deal with weeks 1-5 on campus is rain and a bit of chill.

Once you're on campus, check out what your peers around you are wearing. This gives you a much better impression of brands than a couple students can give you on here. Especially since you'll see everything from name brands like Patagoose to thrifted items. I put WAY too much effort preparing before I arrived on campus, when I could have gotten a better impression of what I'd need when I arrived on campus. Plus, there's thrift shops nearby (ex. Listen in Lebanon) that have just what people in this area wear, weather-wise. Then buy something so you'll have warmer things to wear for the last half of fall term. That's when the wind starts blowing, the frost creeps onto the Green at morning, and you'll wish you had more than a fleece and a thin down.

Ex. I bought a real heavy parka which I spent a lot of internet research on (spoiler alert it came from Aritzia) that was hanging in my closet til winter term, and that I wore once. I instead wore a wool coat with just three buttons in the front the rest of winter. Along with a wool scarf and mittens ofc. Granted, the past winter was unusually warm.

I know shoes can be harder to buy online. I used docs! The classic shiny ones work well in the winter weather because the salt doesn't do much to their special leather. With 1 pair of wool socks I was fine (any brand worked, whether Costco or Smartwool, I just made sure they were the hiking-boot length because they were easier to put on than the knee-length socks but warmer than ankle).

Winter Wear/Clothes to Bring?,heyitsjoshco,"You can survive fall w/o a winter coat, and i recommend buying over thanksgiving break during black friday. A quality down (!) coat would last you a long time. One thing I didn't know personally until literally the end of my freshman winter was that not all winter coats were created equal; synthetic coats generally won't be enough lol but they're great for outdoor activities combined with some layers. Also! Don't size up with your coats! Sure, you'll get more coat, but air will get under and inside making u cold lol. 

During winter, lean towards wearing synthetic fibers/wool/fleece. Cotton traps moisture and when you sweat you'll just be cold. Fleece pullovers from columbia/north face/patagonia are great. Also, check out [wornwear.patagonia.com](https://wornwear.patagonia.com); I'm always pro-sustainable brands, patagonia  is quality and lasts forever, and it's more affordable on sale/used. Also, don't be afraid to buy used; no one can tell the difference + the susti crowd would hype you up on top of it. 

Long underwear (non-cotton) is super useful; recommend Uniqlo's heattech stuff immensely (it's relatively affordable/worth the investment and a good way to add layers).

You don't need to wear the grippy ones daily, just whenever it snows or on the days it warms up enough for a little melt, which will make ice once it cools back down overnight.

One other consideration for boots is to make sure they're waterproof. All that snow and ice will melt once inside and the entryways get pretty messy. 

Also remember that everyone is in the same boat so the 'fashion' of winter footwear becomes a little less important than function- nobody is necessarily going to have super cool or cute boots, so the standard isn't the same as the summer months.

Dartmouth Engineering - How is it?,amos_burton,"I went through Dartmouth's engineering program.  I would say it's very good, but not exactly ""traditional.""  

The biggest difference between engineering at Dartmouth and engineering at a place like, say, RIT (I don't know anything about Vanderbilt), is the size of the program.  I'd guess that Dartmouth graduates ~100 engineering majors a year, give or take.  That means that there just aren't enough students to fill out deep tracks for all the sub-disciplines--Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, etc.

To compensate for that there's essentially a ""core curriculum"" within the engineering school, where you take some intro level courses in a bunch of disciplines before specializing.

So, with that context:

Pros:

 * Even though it's a small department, it's still a department at one of the best schools in the world.  Your classmates are all going to be brilliant, as are your professors (off the top of my head: two of my former classmates now work at Space X, two more work at apple, 3 work at successful high-tech startups, and one is a professor at a Liberal Arts school you may well have applied to, and another did a PhD at one top-10 research institute and is now a Post Doc at another).

 * The ""core curriculum"" thing means that you'll come out really well rounded.  

 * There's a major focus on communication and presentation, so you'll break the ""dorky engineer who can't talk to non-engineers"" stereotype

Cons:

 * The coursework in any one discipline isn't as deep as what you could find at a school with a larger program.  This means that you can't specialize as much, and you may not come out with as much deep technical knowledge.

 * I don't want this list to be shorter and seem biased, but that above point is really the crux of it.

Here's my takeaway: if you're hell-bent on going in to the aerospace industry, or the automotive industry, or being a civil engineer and building bridges, or anything else that's super technical and pocket-protector-y style engineering, you may want to consider going elsewhere.  You won't come out of Dartmouth with the same ""human calculator"" chops that you'd get from a school like RIT.  

BUT: if what you like about engineering is the creative/problem solving aspects (but with more of a quantitative bent), and you are interested in working for startups/small companies, then Dartmouth is perfect.  The breadth of knowledge and communication skills that you'll leave with are *incredibly* valuable to any company where you'll be working in a small or interdisciplinary team.

CS Major,Red_Army,"The CS program is strong, but not super broad because the school is small. It is pretty actively hiring new faculty every year though, and seems to be growing well.

&#x200B;

In terms of the program in general: It is an excellent program for getting involved in research as an undergraduate, because the school is so undergraduate-focused overall. You will not be passed over because a prof wants to focus on their grad students, and you will generally have opportunities to do funded independent research. This in turn makes Dartmouth students fairly attractive to graduate schools, and I think we are overrepresented at top programs relative to our size and our ranking as a CS program. 

&#x200B;

Recruiting varies a bit. The career center is much more focused on banking and consulting, so you have to go through the engineering school for tech recruiting. Microsoft recruits quite actively, and I know other '20s who are working at Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple, so there are definitely opportunities to get into the top companies if you prepare correctly.

Cybenko is really approachable and teaches a sophomore-level course on probability and discrete systems, as well as a graduate-level ML course.

Questions from Incoming Freshman (any help would be muy bueno),veteranshipper,"1. You get randomly sorted into a house and randomly assigned roommates. To up your chances of getting a single, you might have slightly higher chances if you apply for substance-free housing or if you have some kind of accommodations that require you to notify the housing office. You can apply for LLCs (living learning communities) to live in McLaughlin, which was known as ""Hotel McLaughlin"" when I was a student.
2. The shorter summer break is made up by our six week winter break! Most summer programs are 8-10 weeks, and the biggest conflict is that you have to do one that starts later in June due to when our spring term ends.
3. I was a math major and pre-med. If you identify as a woman, you can do the WISP program. Otherwise, wet lab research is pretty easy to get just by cold-emailing profs. Math profs are a little less accessible, since the department tends to be theory heavy, but there are a few profs that are really wonderful to work with! Also, Ecology has a lot of cool math problems, and there is a Mathematical Oncology DSP that I went on that was awesome. Sign up for the HPP (Health Professions Program) newsletters and the NSS (Nathan Smith Society) listserv to stay up to date on all the opportunities for volunteering and the like. There's plenty out there!
4. Greek life here is much tamer and more open than other schools. You can get into any party you want and everybody is fairly chill about whether or not you want to drink because there are many reasons for not wanting to drink shitty Keystone! I'm super introverted and prefer to avoid crowded social spaces, too--you'll find your niche eventually!
5. Intro STEM classes tend to be huge, like 100-200 people. This number quickly dwindles as you move into mid level classes (20-40), and then even further as you hit upper level seminars, where it's common to have 5-10. This is true of almost all STEM fields, although there are certain classes, like ENGS 89/90, that tend to be big just because everyone has to take them. In the math department, the upper levels tend to hover at around 20-30 people. 
6. Probably wait until you arrive in Hanover, and then go buy a winter coat at the local LL Bean or Eastern Mountain Sports store that you can keep there for four years to save yourself the shipping/hassle of transporting it across the country. Invest in a really good winter coat (Patagonia, Arcteryx, Canada Goose are gold standard, Northface, Columbia, Pendleton, or LL Bean are also excellent), some thermal underwear, and a good pair of boots. Also, wool socks and scarves are SO GOOD. Layers keep you warmer than anything else. Thrift a fracket.",10,,False,flzsgk7,False,False,1585632164.0,2020-03-31 00:22:44

This lead to me and my friends hanging out a lot in our dorms rooms together and meeting people on our hall, who we then explored the frats with once the ban was lifted. I have also found my place in Alpha Theta, a gender-inclusive Greek house thats just a lot more chill and welcoming, and also hosts some more chill social events without drinking :) So there’s lots of options and ways to engage with Greek life, and you can also choose not to engage with it at all and still have a great social life.

The rankings work best for schools that are more conventional, as their strengths match up to what the ranking systems measure.  Also, many of the things they score favor larger schools, whereas you likely get a better undergrad education at a smaller school.

Why is Dartmouth ranked so low in engineering/CS but its overall national ranking is still #13,RouletteRog,"College rankings exist for exactly two sets of people: (1) university public relations offices, where they are responsible for writing press releases; (2) anxious moms, who need something to fret over. Nobody in academia pays attention to them and neither should you. Dartmouth gets recruiting visits from all of the big tech companies and many of their faculty members are well-connected within their respective specialist industries. Think of college this way: your job is to impress four faculty members enough that they will each write you a kick ass letter of recommendation. In other words, building a relationship with your professors will provide much more mileage than a silly USNW ranking list. 

But, if you must look at ranking lists, may I suggest the ranking and analysis at [https://www.ivyachievement.com/computer-science-rankings/](https://www.ivyachievement.com/computer-science-rankings/).

Whether Dartmouth's CS program or the Thayer engineering program are the right choice for you will be highly individual. 

* Say you are an undergraduate who wants to pursue a degree in software engineering and then go to Silicon Valley and pursue that FAANG life. Given the way your initial question is stated, I assume that you are pursuing a Bachelor's in CS along with the 5th year Thayer BE. You will have every opportunity that is standard to Dartmouth College undergrads and you will have the opportunity to get to know professors in both schools.   
Is your interest in the medical world? You're in luck! Dartmouth is heavily collaborative with the medical school and many of Thayer's professors are medical engineering researchers. Are you interested in cybersecurity? Once again, I would say that you are well-placed at Dartmouth (depending on where, exactly, your interests lead you; the college is lacking a serious cryptographer, imho). Are you interested in high-performance computing? Maybe Dartmouth isn't the best choice here.
* As a grad student, your first job is to select the best advisor for your interest and to have some idea of a topic that will keep you excited (or at least reasonably interested) for the next few years of your life. As I said above, if you are interested in Applied CS and Engineering in the medical domain then you have ample choice of advisor and program.

Help me decide! Dartmouth vs. Brown,veteranshipper,"1. Hi, Dartmouth is indeed very WASPy! However, there are many cultural organizations and clubs, like KSA, Chinese Culture Club, Asian Americans for Action, Street Soul, etc., in addition to Living Learning Communities that revolve around parts of the Asian diaspora, and the Chinese Language House. There's a joke among me and my friends that every Asian girl knows each other on campus, and there are some stereotypes on campus, like how Asian girls rush KD or Korean guys rush Chi Gam (these are both old stereotypes, but I never claimed to be sratty lol) We are small, but we are mighty! 
2. Greek life does dominate the social scene, but it is by no means the ONLY avenue for fun. I personally had many friends who didn't enjoy the frat scene, and instead we had game nights and movie nights, went out to eat or grab a drink at Molly's, hosted our own parties in our apartments. I think the party scene appeals to a very specific subset of people, and for those of us who don't like to party that much, there's still plenty to do. You sort of learn to make your own fun.
3. Like Brown, Dartmouth is liberal arts. The distributive requirements make it so you have to explore. However, you are limited to three classes a term, so you can't explore *that* much. I graduated a little bit rueful I didn't explore more, but I had a pretty intense courseload. YMMV.
4. Yeah. Hanover is literally three hours away from any major city, compared to Brown, which is forty minutes from Boston. Pros are that it's a fairly safe place to explore being an independent human being, and you can't really fuck yourself up too badly as long as you don't get lost in the woods. Cons, if you're not into going outside a lot, you're gonna get sad.
5. Pros of D-plan: cool opportunities you can't normally get during the summer, sOpHMorE sUMmeR, a means to get the f away from Hanover for a few terms if you're really sick of it through a combo of study abroads, transfer terms, and/or off terms, easy to change. Cons: friendships are hard to maintain, you miss out on some opportunities that start early June/late May, you have to plan your courses pretty carefully for some majors, getting departmental approval for changes in your D-plan can get kind of annoying.
6. Pretty good I think? It's a small department, can't speak much for it since I only took Drawing I, but my friends who were in the department seemed to really like it. They also seem to be very supportive of creating combinations of majors, like Studio Art and Engs, or Digital Art and CS.

Thoughts on the Cognitive Science major/department?,heyitsjoshco,"Cog Sci major-who-hasn't-officially-declared-yet-is-in-3-major-classes here

I personally really love the structure of the major, and the focus area choices makes it interesting to mix and match things to make a coherent focus. 

Currently in jonathan phillips's philosophy of cog sci class; he's an incredible lecturer and really good at just explaining things super well. he was the first cognitive-science-specific professor hired (the major has been largely interdisciplinary and pulled from different departments), so he'll continue to be a constant presence in some of the core major classes. Roskies (who is head of the dept but on sabbatical this year) is, at least I hear, really knowledgeable but not the best lecturer and a little on the stricter end. Also have heard great things about Granger who's the computational neuroscience professor

i'm trying to focus on learning and education, and I will give a hard plug for the education department which is closely affiliated with cognitive science. There's just a lot of fMRI research going on in the education/psych departments which isn't very common among universities.

also will give a plug for the linguistics department, which is also closely affiliated with cog sci.

Engineering extracurriculars at Dartmouth,leadbunny,"Hey OP! I just finished up my BE and I can't recommend DFR enough.  In retrospect, I wish I'd put in more time on it.  Like elibel17 said, it's a fantastic shot at hands-on design and fabrication and will give you skills that can really help you shine during engineering interviews.  If you're into research, there are a ton of opportunities through UGAR.  I did a presidential scholarship in materials engineering.  I didn't have a great experience with my PI, but that wasn't the program's fault and it definitely helped me figure out what kinds of engineering I didn't want to do.  In addition to DHE and DFR, there's also the Aerospace Engineering Club. 

The full list of Thayer groups is here (https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/for/current-students/student-groups/), but as a caveat, the vast majority of the groups are more socially/professionally oriented and less hands-on.  They'll give you good literature and management experience, but DHE and DFR are hard to beat for actual work.  I'd also recommend looking into being a machine shop TA, or just a TA in general. The pay is solid compared to other campus jobs and it's great to be able to give back and help your peers.

Eric Fossum is one of the inventors of the cameras that are in all if our cell phones; George Cybenko wrote the Universal Approximation Theorem for Neural Networks. One or two strong letters of recommendation will do a lot more than a simple degree from a more highly ranked program. Another thing to consider w.r.t. Dartmouth is the alumni network (one of the main reasons to go to any Ivy) and remember that this can also open a lot of doors. You shouldn't have any problem getting a good job with a Thayer degree.

Questions about Dartmouth's engineering program?,seatto2023,"Current Dart '23 here. I talked with my parents (one of who is an engineer) since I was thinking about engineering.

Dartmouth is a liberal arts school with an engineering department with a B.A. (not B.S.) in general engineering. Go to Dartmouth because you WANT a broad liberal arts training as part of your engineering training. But a lot of your classmates probably are not planning to become certified engineers and work in engineering. Might be headed for PM or IP (and on to law school) or graduate school in engineering. Also getting your B.E. will take an extra year (for most people).

I toured some engineering program at other schools and also toured a number of polytechnical universities. After touring both types of schools, I decided that I definitely wanted a liberal arts education though wanted a bigger school than your typical liberal arts school.

Is it hard to register for bio/chem classes at Dartmouth? Hows orgo?,GyanTheInfallible,"It isn’t typically difficult to register for lower-level Biology and/or Chemistry courses, given the large class-size caps and availability of more than one section. Keep in mind, however, that not all classes are offered each term.

In the fall, our department offers Accelerated General Chemistry (CHEM 010), at least one section of General Chemistry I (CHEM 005), one section of General Chemistry II (CHEM 006) and one section of Organic Chemistry I (CHEM 051), as well as some mid- and upper-level/graduate-cross-listed courses.

In the winter, we offer two sections of General Chemistry I (CHEM 005), one section of Organic Chemistry II (CHEM 052) and one section of Honors Organic Chemistry (CHEM 057), as well some mid- and upper-level/graduate-cross-listed courses.

In the spring, we offer two sections of General Chemistry II (CHEM 006), one section of Organic Chemistry I (CHEM 051), one section of Honors Organic Chemistry II (CHEM 058) and one section of Introductory Biochemistry (CHEM 041), as well as some mid- and upper-level/graduate-cross-listed courses.

In the summer, we offer one section of Organic Chemistry II (CHEM 052), as well as some mid- and upper-level graduate-cross-listed courses.

Note that the Accelerated General Chemistry course (CHEM 010) counts for both terms of General Chemistry. Our Biochemistry course does have an associated laboratory, which may alternatively excite or discourage you, but it’s taught by my former PI and I can honestly say was an incredibly enjoyable experience. Note also that if you complete General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, you need only take Basic Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM 064) to complete a minor. That course was also among my favorites at Dartmouth.

I’ve taken all these courses and TA’d for CHEM 005, CHEM 051 and CHEM 052 before, as well as done laboratory set-up for CHEM 057 and CHEM 058, so please let me know if you have any questions.



I can’t say too much about the timing of the Biology department’s offerings, but the ORC will help you. I believe that Physiology (BIOL 14) is offered Fall and Winter, that Cell Biology (BIOL 012) is offered Fall and Spring and that Genetics (BIOL 13) is offered Winter and Summer. Their Biochemistry course (BIOL 40) is also offered Fall and Winter, if I’m not mistaken. No idea about the other foundations courses or the mid- and upper-level courses or graduate-cross-listed courses.

Dartmouth certainly has its flaws. It’s isolation limits students to socializing with the same people, instead of a city like Boston, NY, etc. with many different student populations to mingle within. Alcohol and sexual assault continues to be a problem at Dartmouth. No easy fixes there, but I’d be dishonest not to mention them.

Advice Needed: Dartmouth '67 Needs Pet-friendly Summer Housing,grantvoyager,"Good news: Your timeline is perfect for Dartmouth’s summer term, so there should be plenty of potential options. 
Bad News: They’re mostly going to be geared towards students, so the quality of home / apartment may not be up to your standard. 

First, I’d take a look at Dartlist. Lots of postings go up there every day, and I don’t think you need a Dartmouth email address to create an account. Regardless, any alumni should be able to create an account, so your husband would qualify if there is that requirement. You can post that you’re looking for a summer rental and are adults, not students. I’ve often seen professors looking for people to care for their home over the summers here. This would probably be your ideal situation. There will also be significant numbers of sublets for apartments in the Sachem Village, which is predominantly graduate students living in furnished rentals. 

Second, I would reach out to some realtors. I’ve used Coldwell Bankers Lifestyle (Sam Westelman) in the past. They have quite a few listings looking for renters, though they may not be furnished. 

Third, try posting to DailyUV. The site is hard to navigate but it’s open to the Upper Valley community. 

Lastly, try reaching out to a woman named Jolin Kish of Kish Consulting and Contracting. Her properties are mostly geared toward students, but she has properties all throughout the upper valley that come furnished. She is widely known as the slum lord of Hanover (owns 20+ properties and charges a fortune for them), but she runs a well-oiled machine.

Trans @ Dartmouth?,nkvheivhdfsverv,"Trigger warning -

Hey OP, using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I do not know much about logistics but there's some stuff I want to say about culture. I cannot recommend going to any of the gender inclusive houses. I have a close poc friend who was assaulted and stalked by an amarna, have a poc friend who was an alpha theta and was assaulted by an older alpha theta at the house, and know of at least three separate instances of someone at phi tau assaulting and/or attempting to drug someone (for clarity, these were three separate instances, all with different perpetrators and victims, over a number of years).

Of all the places that have already been recommended on this thread, EKT is the only place that I myself could recommend based on what I've seen and heard about it. Aside from never witnessing anything disturbing at EKT, I've never heard any nightmare stories about it either. It's a wonderful house from what I can tell and is the one place on campus I can recommend without any doubts or hesitation.

I think there are some great people in the gender inclusive houses. However, the culture at all of these houses is nowhere close to their claims of a ""safe space"" environment. I know too many people who found ""the best years of their lives"" ruined because they joined or spent time at one of the gender inclusive houses thinking they'd find a safe space there, only to find themselves taken advatage of and then abandoned when they needed support the most. It's true that every year new people join houses and change the culture, and I'm sure you might even get responses from people who defend the gender inclusive houses with great fervor because they have had great experiences there and have made lasting relationships with great people. I also know of people who found great support at some of these houses in times of desperate need. No one can deny that. I just want you to know that those places are not completely free of the very serious issues that plague many of the other frats on Dartmouth's campus, and that just because they claim to provide a safe space, it doesn't mean that they have always delivered on that promise.

As long as you know that and keep that in mind, then even if you do join a gender inclusive house, or any greek house for that matter, it'll be hard for anyone to take advantage of you. I simply know too many friends who wish they'd received a heads up before they went to one of these places and naively bought into them as a ""home"". To the groups of often vulnerable people who join these houses seeking shelter in the form of a safe space, it can be easy to develop too much trust far too quickly. I believe it's important for all incoming classes to understand the complex nature of all social spaces at Dartmouth, and the gender inclusive houses should not be exempt from that scrutiny simply because of the ""safe space"" narrative.

As I said before, I do not know how the logistical side of things plays out when it comes to housing, etc. but I know a number of remarkable trans individuals who are thriving at the school. I'm sure you'll do well too, so best of luck if you decide to apply.",3,,1501754643.0,dl3pdjp,False,False,1501753914.0,2017-08-03 04:51:54
Trans @ Dartmouth?,rian923,"Thank you, this was highly informative. I'm not very interested in greek life at all, so i'm not sure that EKT is the best fit for me. Is greek life housing the only option? What about the affinity housing? It seems like most of the undergraduate houses have some section of gender inclusive rooms... are none of them safe? And, while I am a POC, I am white passing... would i still have the issues listed above? It sounds more like a racism issue than a transphobic issue. While both are still large issues, it's easier for me to deal with the former. 

I am not someone looking for a safe haven. I know the life I have is not going to be an easy one. All i'm looking for is somewhere to live and have my name and pronouns somewhat respected.

Again, thank you for this information ",2,,False,dl43v07,True,False,1501775431.0,2017-08-03 10:50:31
Trans @ Dartmouth?,nkvheivhdfsverv,"Greek houses are definitely not the only option for housing outside of dorms. Dartmouth has a number of Living Learning Communities (LLCs) for people interested in all sorts of things, and members of each LLC are housed together on one floor in some of the best locations on campus. Some LLCs focus on specific areas of study (think politics, languages, entrepreneurship, etc.) and some are identity-based (one of these is triangle house, one of the places on campus which I know house a number of trans students).

I don't think I have personally witnessed racism as overt as the instances of assault and neglect that I mentioned, but it goes without saying that Dartmouth is not free of racism by any stretch of the imagination and I have heard stories from friends about things said at parties and frats (both gender inclusive or otherwise) that would make any decent person's skin crawl. I'm definitely not in a position to comment on how your experience as a white passing individual might differ from those of poc individuals who aren't white passing, sorry. But personally, I can say that despite being someone who is incredibly forgiving when it comes to microaggressions and not sensitive at all about PC-ness, I have still come across a number of racist situations, mostly involving drunk students fwiw, that simply blew my mind in terms of both their unbridled nature as well as the lack of acknowledgment or any kind of censure by peers who witnessed them. You'll definitely hear rhetoric about allies wanting to make positive change with great urgency, but there's a strong tendency at the school to ignore all problematic behaviors and ""move on"" from serious matters with an even greater urgency. 

Happy to answer your questions, and thanks for asking! I hope more people see posts like this and are able to get a fuller understanding of the campus and its many complexities. I know my posts have been 99% negative, but there's a lot to love about the school and the surrounding areas.

Just to quickly address it, Dartmouth will provide you with a pretty solid amount of financial aid if you need it but obviously everyone's financial situation is different. 

The program is an incredible opportunity but it is definitely an adjustment. In my case, I was a dual degree who began in the Summer term rather than the fall. It can be a bit difficult to become integrated into the campus when only sophomores who have known each other for two years are on campus with you. For me, I really didn't feel comfortable until the winter term of my junior year. 

The education is obviously good. Thayer provided me with an excellent undergraduate engineering education in my opinion and I'm really happy I completed the program. Most professors are pretty solid but it does vary. Your experience as a dual will vary depending on if you're a 2-1-1-1 or 3-2 dual.

Concerning housing, there are a lot of off campus apartments in Hanover. While they aren't the must luxurious places to live, they're relatively close to campus. The rent in Hanover is a bit high mind you.

So a 2-1-1-1 spends their Junior year and a 5th year at Dartmouth while a 3-2 spends their senior year and 5th year there instead. Educationally, there is no difference.

Is Dartmouth Worth 25k in Debt/year?,wishiwaskayaking,"If you're planning on consulting/finance/politics/possibly tech, where school brand matters a lot and Dartmouth will legitimately open doors with campus recruiting and the alumni network, then yes Dartmouth is super ""worth it"", from a purely financial standpoint. McKinsey/Blackstone/Goldman/Google/The White House don't really recruit at Kansas State. They do at Dartmouth. And no doubt, a Dartmouth transcript looks marginally better for med/law/gradschool admissions, and you will have a ton of access to research and volunteering opportunities, opportunities that might push you up on the prestige scale for med school admissions. 

That said, if you just want to be a doctor, if you don't particularly care where you end up at med school, your local state school will probably fine. Dartmouth being worth X amount of debt is a complicated question, depending on your personal situation, and how much you care about soft factors. I love Dartmouth for the outdoors and for the tight-knit student body, for the faculty relationships and for the research opportunities, for the surprisingly open Greek life and for the intense friendships I've made. But I don't have a counterfactual - I have no clue how I would have enjoyed my flagship state school. But Dartmouth has been incredible for me, and given my desires, and the path I'm seeking, it was super worth it for me. The doors I want to go through are open to me because of Dartmouth. The doors you may want to go through might open just as easily if you go to your state school, and you'll be carrying significantly less debt. 

There is no easy answer. You gotta distill want you want, what you care about, where you want to go and what you'll need to get there, and then see if the debt load is worth it or not.",14,,1585592780.0,flxwhj3,False,False,1585591139.0,2020-03-30 12:58:59

To put it in perspective, [the lowest average salary for a physician is still a healthy six figures, and keeps on rising](https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2018/10/04/physician-compensation).

So in the long run, regardless of interest rates, you'll *easily* pay that debt off. Yes, you'll be accruing interest after all those times, but what you earn far outpaces what you're paying back.

Vermont 2021 Ski Trip,iamspartacus5339,"You’re asking a pretty wide range of questions across a very wide range of resorts and mountains. First- I recommend reposting and following r/icecoast it’s a very active sub about skiing in New England.

So for Vermont you’ve got a ton of options, typically limited by what pass you have and tbh epic is the way to go now. It will get you to Mt. Snow, Stowe, and Okemo. 

Killington, Okemo, Stowe, and Mt. Snow are your biggest “resorts” with the biggest range of runs and food/lodging opportunities. If you’re staying in Burlington though a lot of those will be a far drive. Stowe is close, so is Sugarbush and Smugglers Notch. Jay peak is a bit of a drive but a solid spot.

I however recommend checking out some smaller independent mountains that are pretty sweet- Jay Peak way up north, and Magic Mountain (southern VT) are smaller but have some solid terrain.

To answer a few other questions-Uber from Burlington to any of the resorts will be expensive and pretty far (45 min at least). Any of the bigger mountains will have solid terrain parks, especially the vail owned ones. Cheapest? The small ones for sure (Jay, Smuggs, Sugarbush, Magic- or the really small ones like suicide six, Whaleback (NH).  Best beer- they all have bars and have VT beer on tap, which means you have to get some heady topper.

I just covered VT but there’s skiing in NY, NH and Maine that is solid too. For backcountry- Tuckerman’s Ravine and some areas near Smuggs/Stowe but take the same backcountry precautions you would out West, it’s just as dangerous.",8,,False,fkpd29h,False,False,1584407238.0,2020-03-16 20:07:18
Vermont 2021 Ski Trip,MultiGeometry,"Uber: I think you should plan on having a rental car. You can't depend on Uber/Lyft. We have it but not at volume. You can't depend on getting places efficiently. Since you're only here for a short while, it may be worth just picking one resort and learning it a bit, instead of newly exploring a new resort each day. The resorts aren't nearly as big as they are out west, but they're big enough that they should keep you busy for 1-2 days. 

Backcountry: Mt. Washington and Mt. Katadin have some crazy terrain. I don't know much about Katadin except that it's logistically very difficult so it wouldn't be worth it for your trip. Early January can be pretty rough in the backcountry to the point where I wouldn't even plan on it, but bring your stuff in case the weather plays nice. Exploring Mt. Washington should be done with avy gear, and probably a guide since no one is familiar with the terrain. There are other dedicated backcountry areas that are popping up, Granite Backcountry Alliance (NH) and RASTA (VT) come to mind.

Sidecountry: Sugarbush, Stowe, and Sugarloaf might be good places to consider. Each mountain will have it's own feel and dangers, but have decent sidecountry options available via lift service. I don't know enough to advise you the best plan and it can be tough to get the locals to spill the beans on where the best skiing is. Best to do some research on forums. As mentioned in another comment, a skier died recently at Stowe, and presumably had prior experience in the ""Birthday Bowls"". BB is also accessible via Smugglers Notch. The road between Smuggs and Stowe is groomed for XC skiing in the winter, so not accessible by car. Everyone has their own risk tolerance level, but anecdotally I will tell you the vast majority of skiers exploring these areas will not have avy gear.

On piste: Mad River Glen is one of the only ski areas I've been to on the east coast that incorporates cliffs into their standard terrain. It's a funky little mountain with archaic lifts, but the skiing is rugged. Definitely worth checking out.

Cost: the big players keep buying up resorts and changing ticket policies. Deals that were available 5 years ago aren't necessarily an option anymore. I'd look at Ikon/Epic pass options, but also see if Sugarbush is still doing 'quad packs' or Killington doing 'K-Tickets'. This can get the cost of tickets down to \~$60-70 a piece.",4,,False,fkqprzn,False,False,1584452692.0,2020-03-17 08:44:52

1) MRG / Magic have some serious cliff lines. MRG has better trees. Killi has my favorite glades on the east, but they get tracked out. Stowe has some out of bounds glades that are killer. Jay is way up there and is supposed pretty good. Smuggs also supposedly has some good terrain, but I've never been to either. 

2) Cheapest is probably somewhere like Magic. Cheaper tickets, and then airbnb nearby

3) that's a long uber from burlington. stay near the mountain and rent a car

4) Snow's Corinthia is probably the best park, Killi also has good parks. Stowe is really not someplace to go for park skiing, form what I can tell (not a park skier myself)

5) Stowe is the fanciest. Good food and beer. Killi is the biggest party, bars and restaurants up and down the access road. Southern Vermont is a little more spread out, but still fun.",2,,False,fkqqn0k,False,False,1584453287.0,2020-03-17 08:54:47

graduate student moving from California,wishiwaskayaking,"Congrats! LA to Dartmouth undergrad here.

Differences:

The weather. Duh. Budget like $400+ for coat+winter boots if you don't have them already. Would also strongly suggest getting one of them sun lamps or at least a large supply of vitamin D pills. 

The culture. Frankly, people in general seem a bit more formal, a bit more buttoned up (at least among the undergrads). People tend to dress a tad more formally than what I'm used to (t-shirts and jeans all day every day), and there's just a formal feel. It's really hard to describe. At the same time, people do feel a bit more genuine once you get to know them, and I've definitely found community in Dartmouth. And at least as an undergrad, people seem to drink more and smoke less than back home, though there are tons of people who do one, both, or neither. 

The food. We don't have much. There's isn't much good ""ethnic"" food nearby, nor are there any good ethnic grocery stores. Would recommend stocking up in Boston every now and then. Boloco/Jewel/BaseCamp/SushiYa/TukTuk get's old surprisingly quickly.

Similarities: 

Outdoorsy-ness: SoCal is relatively outdoorsy, and you can definitely get your fix at Dartmouth. There is so much amazing hiking nearby, and the river is beautiful when it's warm enough to kayak/canoe. 

Auto-centricity. Hanover itself is quite walkable, but I would strongly suggest getting a car if you are able. It makes everything from grocery trips to get-aways a million times easier.",1,,False,fj1lc8p,False,False,1582922468.0,2020-02-28 14:41:08

Victoria Somoff's Vampires, Witches, and Firebirds (Russian 13) is another class I loved. (Gave me more insight into Orson Scott Card's book Enchantment, and deepened my appreciation of the Witcher books and games.)

Annelise Orleck's courses are pretty much all worthwhile too, especially American Women in the 20th Century (HIST 028).

I don't think he's taught it for a while, but if you get the chance, take James Murphy's Jurisprudence course. Really fascinating questions discussed there.

Then, follow all the cultural groups, dance groups, comedy groups, and a capella groups (if you go on the dartmouth coso website and look at the listings, you should be able to find all their names). There's also a scattering of bands and dj's around campus whose accounts you might be able to find as well where they post show announcements (I would send them, but it might be a crowd of people who you don't know and that could be uncomfortable, so I'm gonna hold off). 

Also, if you entirely reject the greek system and reduce it down to ""drinking and partying,"" then you're limiting yourself significantly, though not entirely. I don't drink, and I'm unaffiliated, but I'll still often be out at frat shows for performance groups, playing water pong (it's like ping pong with targets! big fan, even without the drinking, and it's not stigmatized at all just ask a brother where their sink is because you wanna play with water), and at concerts for the campus bands.

I'd also consider the occasional hike; as a not-so-fit person, I've found that the DOC is super accommodating and still super active during winter. Also, climbing gym is $35 a term with free rentals, and everyone there's so nice and willing to hit you up with pointers even if you've never climbed before!

Help?,1251throwaway,"as a POC myself, I think they have a valid point. 

I also don't think it's necessarily a fault of the school/affirmative action in admissions that there aren't as many POCs. POCs don't like rural areas because the environments outside of the school are very white. The school itself, however, has made a lot of efforts in diversity in recent years, and the freshman class is now 44% POC, which is a HUGE increase that you'll feel as the years go on. 

Also, from my experience, I have always been implicitly scared away from environments for being too white; I've never had someone tell me that I can't be part of a space because I'm not white enough. My point here is that you can be scared away from these spaces, but oftentimes, if you make the effort, these people will be welcoming to you despite your differences in identity. 

If you're looking to immerse yourself in a microcosm of your own personal culture, you won't find it at Dartmouth. But, you'll find so much else. You'll find, learn, and try things that were unimaginable in your own culture and even realize how valuable and fun those things could be. You'll learn how to interact with people different from you on a daily basis, and this prompts a stronger understanding of your perspective and that of others. You really learn how to see the world from other people's eyes, and you strengthen your conviction of your own personal values and perspectives in the process. 

I just want to clarify: I miss home, I miss my culture, and I miss being around people that look and act like me. But this place has exposed me and strengthened my identity as a POC without having to be directly discriminated against on a daily basis (unlike the ""real world""). I don't feel like my opportunities nor my life on campus are impeded by my race, but I've been made aware of who I am, strengthened my conviction in my identity, and feel like I'm strong enough to weather the punches in every other white-dominated space I'm in throughout the rest of my life. Dartmouth has made me a stronger activist, albeit unintentionally, and I strongly encourage you to look at it that way instead of being constantly resentful of a community that has so much to give you",6,,False,fdj4zys,False,False,1578458606.0,2020-01-07 22:43:26

PC disadvantages: Non-Unix cmdline, needs to run vbox for some Unix stuff

I still think whoever made this had some points though.

(and as a 23 its still a bit insulting that our only priority is a term that's mandatory anyway. Let's make it equally suck pls).

Ik its not the main point of the petition but also Dart seems so ignore the reduction in education quality. Their line of 1 comment on 20 pages also resonated with me, I had gotten zero feedback or a single graded assignment for two of my classes by like week 6/7 (past the point where I could have dropped a 4th class).

I want to transfer before even starting,biggreen10,"I can try to address these bit by bit, but some of this feels like really serious oversight/lack of research on your part.

* The quarter system, and with it the D-Plan, is a huge part of what makes Dartmouth unique. Yes, it can be hectic, but you get used to it. 

* Can't really say the DartHub is outdated. It was updated about a year and a half ago, and having worked at other universities, it could be far worse. Also, this is one of the most minor issues I've ever heard anyone raise about a school

* Not really sure what you mean by this one. Some classes will have the ability to see your grade as the term progresses, others won't, but you can always ask the instructor to discuss your grade

* Definitely no grade deflation, what makes you think that? The average GPA is a 3.4something

* Yep, there's a lot of involvement in Greek life, and this is something that is well known about Dartmouth. Having seen Greek systems at other schools, I have a lot of stuff I like about how Dartmouth does it. Obviously there are issues to continue to address, but overall it fares better than most I've seen

I want to transfer before even starting,jisa,"I don't want to seem disrespectful, but if you did research on Dartmouth without realizing Dartmouth works on the quarter system or has a major Greek life presence, you may want to work on how you do research? I'm not saying that to be a jerk! But those are probably the first two things that people come across when considering Dartmouth. I do worry that if the quarter system or Greek life presence comes as a surprise to you now, you may find the level of research that Dartmouth requires of students to be challenging.

That said, if you have concerns about knowing how well you're doing in your classes, go to office hours. Your professors can give you a sense of your level, where and how you can improve, etc.

The student portal? Really not an issue... It's not going to have a major impact on your student experience.

Grade DEflation? Not an issue. I've heard complaints about the opposite.

The ""hectic quarter system"" has its advantages and disadvantages. 10 week terms doesn't leave a lot of time for academic lollygagging--students have to stay on top of their work. (It's a work hard, play hard school.) But the opportunities to do internships, abroad programs, and the like during an academic year instead of just the summer like most other schools gives Dartmouth students a major advantage. I had an internship at a Federal agency during my junior winter where I worked on matters that typically only went to law students, for example. Summer interns tended to be given more copying and errand-type tasks.

The Greek system is a big part of student life at Dartmouth. It's not, however, the only life at Dartmouth. One can find one's niche and have an active, happy social life without ever stepping foot in a Greek house. One can also participate in Greek parties without belonging to a Greek house--Dartmouth parties are open. And you might surprise yourself by becoming interested in Greek life--every house is different, with its own sense of identity, culture, activities, etc. There's a wide range--there's typical hard-drinking, ranging party houses; there's the coed houses; there's houses that are heavily student-athletes; there's houses that are more geeky; etc. etc. etc.",13,,False,fegm33p,False,False,1579096921.0,2020-01-15 08:02:01

Most people don't know nor understand dartmouth until, oftentimes, partway through their second year.

So please, chill tf out. And also, figure yourself out.

I want to transfer before even starting,sprachkundige,"I was really nervous about attending Dartmouth largely because of the Greek scene (after I got all my decisions back, I told my parents I wanted to go to Rice, and they basically said no, you got into schools we can drive to, you're going to one of those).  I had this vision in my mind that sororities and fraternities were going to be Legally Blonde, Animal House-style, and that there would be nothing else to do.  But I ended up loving Dartmouth, and I promise it really isn't like that.  

Despite my hesitations, I did end up joining a sorority, but it was a local house, not part of a national organization, and it was just a great group of women who chose to live together and support one another.  Plus, since nobody can rush before sophomore year, you don't end up only having friends within the Greek system - I had lots of close friends who were unaffiliated as well as in other sororities/fraternities and in co-ed houses.

Dartmouth is an easy place to love.  There's so much enthusiasm for the school and so many different ways to take advantage of it.  Even if the Greek scene isn't at all for you, there are so many other ways to build community and get involved.  But I recommend you do find some way to get involved -- I think the people who are the most likely to not love Dartmouth will be those who don't make an effort to take advantage of the community.  And again, that doesn't have to be in any way related to Greek life -- I was pretty involved in my house, sure, but also in AQ (Catholic group) and also in Cabin & Trail (hiking), and I had Sunday Thanksgiving Dinner (is that still a thing, now that Homeplate isn't its own entity anymore?) with my freshman floormates pretty much every week I was on campus for all 4 years.

Also, yes, the winters are cold, but, since you have to take 3 PE classes anyway, consider learning a winter sport.  Getting outside and enjoying the winter weather is so much fun, and nothing's cozier than coming in and drinking a hot chocolate by the fire in Collis after a day of snowshoeing or whatever.

Within each quarter you take 2-4 classes. Typically there’s a midterm period at about three and six weeks and then finals to close out the quarter. 

Dartmouth starts classes later in the Fall And finishes classes in later the Spring than other schools bc of this. Typically mid-Sep for Fall term and wrapping up Spring term in early June.

This isn’t to say that FYSEP is for dumb kids... but the population of people who weren’t in high power high school college prep courses overlaps highly with first gen students.

Moving to Hanover - tips/feedback?,Ski_Away,"Staff member, mid/upper 20s, not from the area, originally from a more urban part of the northeast.

If your small liberal arts school was also in a smaller town rather than right in a major metro area you probably have a good feel for what it'll be like. Downtown Hanover itself is pretty college-centric, for obvious reasons. I do not live there.

Locally, you should check out downtown WRJ as well. Also small, but there's probably half-dozen fairly interesting restaurants (a Cambodian sandwich place just opened, there's a Turkish place, a barbecue place, etc). 

If you like beer, it also has a good tiny brewery (River Roost), a small beer store with an interesting selection (Crowler Pit), and a craft beer bar/eatery (Trail Break), all pretty much next to each other. 

I will echo the other poster that if you are comparing the food to the food scene in a major city, it doesn't really compare, that should be obvious. But it's certainly more than the average small town(s) have.

-------------

In general, the modest concentration of population, the highway nexus, the college/hospital/other employers, and all the Vermonters coming just over the border to NH to dodge sales taxes, means there's a significant amount more in terms of stores/services in the surrounding 15 minutes or so than you would normally get in a rural area with just the population of the couple towns here. So that's nice, you get a smaller town setting without so much of the ""I need XYZ and there's no place that does that here, guess I'm going to drive an hour to the next place with people to get it"".

-------------

Whether or not you need a car to commute, you want a car to live. There's a lot of places to visit in the wider area and a lot of great outdoorsy things to do. You are in one of the best possible locations in the East if you like to ski or hike, just about every mountain/ski resort in VT or NH is within a reasonable driving range. That was part of the draw to the area for me.

Assuming you have a car, the cities really are not *that* far away. Burlington is 1:30, Boston is ~2:00, both entirely in range for day trips. If you don't hate driving, it's possible to make it to Boston in time for a Friday night concert for some band you wanted to see or the like if you leave straight from work (5PM). Montreal is a wonderful place as well and is ~3:15, not too far for an overnight/weekend.

Moving to Hanover - tips/feedback?,adamjackson1984,"I was working at a startup, 80 hour weeks, making below a living wage and spending 4 hours a day on Muni / Caltrain to get to work when a headhunter called me about a job at TomTom in NH. 20% higher pay (this was back when startups weren't paying people anything after the 2008 recession, rent was $1500 a month, my salary was 65K).

It's also worth mentioning that aside from the fiscal hardships I was feeling, I had been in SF for 5 years and was in a really dark place. Not suicidal just bummed. I never did anything for myself, it was just a hustle. No parks, no vacations, no alone time just job to tech party to conference to job and I was gaining weight and depressed.

Getting off Dartmouth coach in Hanover, I was surrounded by trees, small buildings, fair prices on food and drinks, it just felt like a vacation for the first year here. I could clock out of work at 5PM, I started finding hobbies, friends and I had space, money and time for things like motorcycling, writing, photography and hiking.

Two years ago, I bought a house and finally started diversifying my income again..I am an entrepreneur at heart but I needed a 5 year break from SF for my mental and physical health

\----

I mention all of this because Hanover & NH by proxy is something I really needed. I think any small town would have given me the chance to reset.

For people who truly embrace SF and need the BarCamps and Meetups and Conferences and 24 hour Starbucks and 11Pm Sushi and ""pillow fights"" on Valentine's day, you're really going to have a tough time here. But if you can embrace the quiet, eating dinner at 8PM and the outdoors, I think you and others may find it's nice to rediscover yourself and hope that the culture here allows for the self-expression that SF embraced. If you're already pretty vanilla, you'll fit in but if burning man and swingers parties on New Years are your thing, you'll long to be back on the 'left coast'.

I spend a week in SF once a year and do a deep dive in everything I love about the city but I'm also thankful to be in a place in my life where I can afford to go to SF for a week and catch a ball game, eat an Ike's sub and lay in Dolores all day drinking beer.

This was a long reply but everyone is so different, I had to provide some context for why I love it here so much.

**More practical advice?**

* Get a reliable form of transportation. I bought a beater my first year and the cold and rust and weather destroyed it after a year.
* Grab some proper winter clothes. Invest in a good jacket, Sorel boots, faux-fur cap and gore-tex gloves. The stuff you wear on that once a year trip to Tahoe won't cut it
* I'm a foodie and movie lover. I'd spend all day at the Metreon every Saturday so I've brought my hobbies inside meaning, Plex Server in the house with 2,000 movies, 65"" 4K TV with surround, a fancy espresso / pour over setup with a custom designed kitchen allowing me to smoke meat outside, Sous vide, etc. You won't find anything SF offered you here and you'll need to make it your own. so think about what you loved in the bay area and learn to make it yourself because odds are, the Philz style of coffee or adult grilled cheese won't be a thing here.
* Check out [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) because if you're not in the dartmouth network (hospital or college), you're going to have a hard time meeting people. New England is all about who you know. The girl you'll date (or guy) will be someone you meet through someone else. Dartmouth has this ability to pull people in where dartmouth people only hang with dartmouth people. Being an outsider not employed by dartmouth, I'm forced to hang out with the ""townies"" as everyone calls them in Dartmouth world. There are good smart people here but you won't meet them at Canoe club or Wal Mart. People really keep to themselves. [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) helps.
* You will not have reliable cell service outside of Hanover. Get used to pre-caching your news, Spotify music and podcasts. Streaming is no longer a reliable option
* Plan in time to get to Montreal or Boston every 3 months until you acclimate to up here. You're going to miss actual good food. Hanover is edible but as soon as I start liking the sushi or mexican food in NH, I get the heck down to Boston ASAP so I can re-calibrate my palate. Just sitting in a busy cafe in Montreal gives me energy and drive. I start to lose that stuck up here where you have Dartmouth yes but most people here are blue-collar and just working to retirement. I don't see a lot of that innovation up here. 
* We finally have Uber here (seriously) so luckily, getting home after drinking is easier. Before then, me or my GF were always the DD. Mostly we just drink at home.

Dartmouth also has some incredible CS profs, including Thomas Corman, who literally wrote the book on algorithms. Oh, and one of our presidents literally wrote BASIC. 

Research: Despite the departments (relatively) small size there is quite a lot of undergraduate research happening at Dartmouth. You can work under a professor, apply for grants, work for DALI (the design lab), and/or do a senior honors thesis, which gives you a lot of flexibility to take a deep dive into whatever subject really interests you.

Employment/Interships: I really wouldn't worry about this one. The Dartmouth alumni network is one of the best in the country and gives you a surprising amount of leverage in terms of opportunities outside of the college.

EDIT, I read the abstract.  I had difficulty pulling out a one-line thesis, but I think the closest is that, ""Dartmouth perpetuates its traditions with vigor, and this commitment has had an important effect upon the college's culture.""  Here are some quotes:

> It is distinctive from the other Ivies because of its smaller size and remoteness, which beget a particular sense of place and insularity.  These traits, in addition to the visual qualities of the College as seen in its cultural landscape, present an impression of Dartmouth as an Arcadian, unpretentious, secluded academic paradise in quiet, rural New Hampshire, much like the early stories and romantic images of the College suggest (Figure 1).  But these images do not correspond with a more critical look at the reality of the College. p. 1.

> Dartmouth represents itself today as a progressive, tolerant, even idealistic institution when its landscape, institutional history, folk traditions, and contemporary culture largely suggest otherwise. p. 2.",3,,1342685540.0,c5g7038,False,False,1342683571.0,2012-07-19 02:39:31

I arrived there in 1965, and at our 50th reunion  we found Dartmouth still the vibrant, exciting place we have always loved. Many, many changes have happened at The College, but it’s still “Dear old Dartmouth, bless her name.” My daughter went to Harvard, but she married a Dartmouth man. There is no place like Dartmouth, and as Daniel Webster said, “She is a small college, but there are those of us who love her!” When I was there I conducted tours, so I hope there is a student tour guide who can help you. The pandemic will affect how things are going, but once everyone is back it will be quite a ride. The students I met last year were simply outstanding—warm, brilliant, diverse, welcoming, and wonderful. My one regret is that I had only four years at Dartmouth. I’d return today given the opportunity, and I am a very old alumnus.

Experience with taking 4/5 classes?,Red_Army,"I started five four class terms (including 20S) and ended up dropping two of those before the 7th week. 

IMO it's great if there are extra classes you want to take or if you want to open up flexibility for extra two class terms. It definitely takes extra effort (and I think especially for remote classes requires extra discipline) but could be a great way to give yourself an extra two class on campus term later. The flexibility from being able to drop without penalty until so far into the term means there aren't really any reasons not to try it.

Experience with taking 4/5 classes?,seatto2023,"I did 4 classes 20S. 3 STEM and freshman seminar. I found it brutal. For me watching online lectures is so much more draining. With 4 classes, I never had a break. There was always something due. I'm glad I got my STEM pre-reqs out of the way but it was tougher than I expected.

Tips: Stay organized and disciplined. Sure with the pandemic, you have fewer outside distractions but there are plenty of online distractions that will derail you. Fortunately, you are prob less likely to get sick, which is what really set me back in fall and winter. There was at least one plague each quarter that ripped through campus. Lastly if you are on campus for fall, try to be extra vigilant about getting work done early. When we had to abruptly leave during winter finals week, it was incredibly hard to focus. I dropped a letter grade in one class when I bombed my final paper that I'd put off (normally I can bang out a paper just fine). Ug. Being mentally prepared for that possibility and not letting things go to the last minute will help in case you find yourself in that situation. If you are a 24 and on campus, don't underestimate the mental energy associated with dealing with weekly/daily curveballs due to covid. It'll be fine, but it's a reality that it's a mental distraction that makes it harder to concentrate on academics.",3,,False,g17se9q,False,False,1597241986.0,2020-08-12 09:19:46
Experience with taking 4/5 classes?,tasukete_onegai,"Taking an extra class is useful since it's much better to go from 4->3 than going from 3->2 if your schedule doesn't work out. I personally try to take four every term and then eventually drop down to three if the course/professor doesn't work out. In freshmen year, I had to drop down from 3->2 and it was a lot rougher than it should have been if I had a backup planned. There's a two week period for add/drop, but usually by then, it's a lot harder to catch up with a course. 

Whenever I take four, I always have two expendable classes (classes that I just need for distrib credit) or classes that I know I'll have to take again in the future, so there's no harm dropping. I think the worst class to drop is one where the professor greatly depends on the quality/content of the course since it can mess up what you already know beforehand. 

Last term I took 4 lab courses, two for my major and two just for the SCI/SLA credit. Would not recommend, but I survived. I took Astro 1 as one of my expendable because I didn't particularly care and it was pass/fail. Quizzes were easy to look for answers and I got a tutor to carry me during the labs. The class was absolutely a mess online since it used pre-recorded lectures, so I didn't feel bad about not taking it seriously. My other expendable was actually a course I was going to take this summer and get ahead on, but I made it so far and the bar for pass/fail was low enough that I just ended up ending the term with four courses. 

As for tips, non-STEM courses are much easier for me remote since discussion-based content is way easier than trying to force yourself to sit down and memorize stuff for a test, unless the test content can be looked up online (thanks Quizlet!). Balancing classes in pass/fail was more of a ""which one do I actually try in vs. which one can I try to hit the minimum bar"". Since they're going back to grading this fall, might just take classes you can NRO. 

Anyways, I personally think you have nothing to lose when you take four courses (except some sanity if you decide to stick with four). Would recommend at least 2 layups if you want to take four and stick with all of them by the end of the term.",5,,False,g167fa0,False,False,1597198440.0,2020-08-11 21:14:00

My lab took less time online than in person would have, but zoom labs are more draining. 

My main problem is that I have horrible time management skills, so if you can actually sit down and get work done, you will be okay.

You're pretty onpoint about bio19, strongly suggest NOT taking it. Stick to bio11 or bio12 (most prefer bio11 cuz its an intro to bio course). It'll give you a good sense of the difficulty level of dartmouth. There are wayyyyyyy too many freshmen who underestimate the difficulty and take bio19 only to get a subpar grade. Same thing with the people who take Chem 10.

Not sure if they're offering chem6 in the winter this year (sometimes they do, sometimes they don't). If they do I would just get Chem5 out of the way in the fall. It's a relatively easy course anyways, esp if you've already taken AP chem. 

People typically do Chem5-6 freshmen year; Bio12 and 13 and Orgo 1 and 2 sophomore year; and biochem junior year; Physics 3-4 isnt hard and so just take that whenever you want, as with Psych1.  Bio2  (or 14 if you want to be ambitious) just take sometime before the MCAT

Difficulty/choice of intro Bio/Chem classes?,Butterscotch-Alive,"ok sounds good.

For Chem 5, apparently the median is super low (B-) according to layuplist. Should i be worried about that? I have taken AP chem before but how easy is the class truly? How much time would i need to spend on it per week to get an A?

Oh and lastly, this isnt a direct med question, but do freshman not have a summer term or can they opt for one? Apparently our fees are for the 3 semesters (not summer). Does that mean we can’t do internships or anything at that time either?",1,,False,g0utfya,True,False,1596942264.0,2020-08-08 22:04:24
Difficulty/choice of intro Bio/Chem classes?,SucktheZuck123," I believe the choice is between bio2 vs bio14 as both do anatomy, its just that bio2 is easier. Would strongly recommend it as the prof is great. 

As for coursework, I was able to complete all my premed courses by the end of junior year, and thats with a econ major and public policy minor (and had plenty of spots for interesting/fun courses). This coming senior year i legitimately have 0 major or premed courses left to take, and am just taking whatever the hell I want. So I would plan out your D-plan but honestly I wouldnt worry too much about finishing if you're doing a non premed major.

As for Chem5, layuplist says for me that for the last 5 years the median is always a B. The median is set to a B by dartmouth guidelines, so it'll never a B-. Everyone I know that took AP chem and did well got an A in the class. What pulls the median down is others that may not have that background unfortunately. I got an A in the course, and I did it by doing all the assigned problems and re-doing the ones I had trouble on. Chem5 is all about rinse and repeat, not that much difficult problem solving imo.

As for your term question. you'll be on fall to spring. You CAN opt to take summer on, I know some people who did it. But honestly EVERYONE takes sophomore summer on, and its one of the best times of the year. If you take freshman summer on and sophomore summer on, it would mean you'd be on 8 terms in a row which is brutal (even 6 terms in a row is called the ""suicide 6""). 

I was able to do a paid research internship my freshman summer. You'd probably get something similar. Recruiting for actual companies is quite difficult ur first year so research is the easiest route to get some experience. As for internships DURING the year, you probably wouldnt have time. Just focus on extracurriculars and finding a prof to do long-term research with. They do have ""externships"" during the 6-week winter break we get between fall and winter. Since you're asking about internships, can I assume it'd be something business related? I just finished my Life Sciences/Healthcare consulting internship this week, and would be happy to chat with you about that process.",1,,False,g0uuyrb,False,False,1596943216.0,2020-08-08 22:20:16
Bank to use while at Dartmouth,rmanwill7,"I'd recommend Bank of America, there is a location on main street (so no atm fees), and besides it is one of the two largest banks in the country (w/ JPM Chase) so you will usually be able to find one. On the checking and savings, I'd recommend both. If you are a student, you can get them with no monthly fees, and having both allows you to better budget and save. Put your paycheck into checking, then move a fixed amount into savings (e.g. 30%, or whatever fits your needs).

Additionally, you should think about opening a brokerage account and start investing. Bank of America owns Merrill Lynch and you can link your accounts, so I would do it here. It might seem silly given you won't (I assume) be working with that much money, but it really helps to start early and learn how to be a smart investor.

Bank to use while at Dartmouth,mrcnylmz,"I had a student loan automatically dispursed to school so I didn't make those payments (I'm a grad student btw)

Overall, I'd say US banking system sucks and outdated and fees are outrageous (I'm Turkish). So what I do is, instead of carrying lots of cash on me, I deposit that cash to Türk Ekonomi Bankası (which was acquired by BNP Paribas few years ago) and withdraw that cash from an BofA ATM, with no fees. Then I deposit that money right away to my accounts at BofA so I can use them to transfer money with no fees (Zelle).

Carrying cash over 10,000 USD is subject to declaration while entering to US. That's not a big problem if you declare it or not because you have a valid reason. If you don't declare and get caught there's a fıne for that. On top of everything, I don't recommend you to carry cash over 10,000 USD; it's a huge security threat.  


Since you're in Eurozone, I strongly believe there is an affiliated bank with BNP Paribas network in your home country. Check this link: [https://locators.bankofamerica.com/international.html](https://locators.bankofamerica.com/international.html)  


I also add TEB's website and it's probably more accurate and inclusive than BofA's. It's in Turkish but I don't think you'll have problems recognizing country names and affiliated bank.

"If I am thinking about majoring in Econ, should I take Econ 1 and Math 3 both in Freshman fall?",heyitsjoshco,"You could try both, but I know these are two classes that freshmen unexpectedly struggle with, even if they were good at math/econ in high school. Remember that you have a 2 week period at the start of the term that you can drop a class without a W on your transcript, but also that it's MUCH harder to get into another class/catch up after the first week. 

I'd recommend trying doing the work for 4 classes (the fourth being your backup if math 3/econ 1 don't work out, but make sure you can get into it), seeing what *kind* of work each class entails, and judging for yourself whether it'll be manageable in the same term. There's no shame in dropping/switching classes since people do it all the time, and there's also professors whom you may not mesh very well with (Math 3 is known for having a very variable experience since it's the only class at dart, I believe, taught by phD students).",7,,False,fyd6rn1,False,False,1594998507.0,2020-07-17 10:08:27

Graduating in three years with economics major?,elibel17,"Like someone else said, you would have to do 8 4-course terms and one regular 3-course.

If you do end up studying econ (which you might not, by the way, people change majors and interests all the time!) , you will learn about opportunity costs. Think of the opportunity costs involved here: 4 courses all the time means you miss out on the time to build your resume, grind on those tough courses, make connections that will last throughout your life, etc. Also, if you, like a ton of econ majors/ Dartmouth grads, want to go into banking/consulting, the junior year internship is a great time to narrow your interests,  and gain valuable work experience. Not sure how you can replicate that in the 3 years. 

As someone else said, you could take a middle road and take an extra off term/graduate a term early without that much difficulty (still 4 courses twice which isn't something to laugh at).

Geisel Med School,,"I don’t know what exactly is causing Geisel to be ranked so low but I’ll give it a shot. If I remember correctly, research is a part of most ranking systems and Geisel finds itself in a weird position where it’s main teaching hospital and the med school recently financially separated themselves and much of the research that once was attributed to the school is now attributed to the hospital meaning it appears that the school is not producing much (although all the researchers are the same and the students are free to work with whoever they like). Additionally, Geisel has committed itself to diversity and accepts a good amount of non traditional students. While this does provide a cohort of students who come from different backgrounds and experiences, many of the non traditional students also tend to have been out of school for period of time or have little exposure to sciences beyond the bare minimum to apply (no offense to the liberal arts majors but gender studies and the like are not going to prepare you for the academic challenges of med school, particularly when so many are self described “bad test takers” to begin with). There is also a big push for humanism (they bring in patients and families to speak to students a lot, try to bring up social justice quite a bit, focusing considerably on how to interact with patients early on) which while not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, it has come at a cost of losing some of the focus on academics. Compound this with the fact that Dartmouth as a parent institution does not invest in Geisel very much and as such, Geisel is struggling financially unlike many of the other Ivy League med schools. Overall this has led to Geisel being unable to keep up with the general trend of national board exam scores rising (the school is generally consistent year to year/may have a slight downward trend now) and many students generally not being provided many resources for help (we were basically waiting for Mrs Geisel to die get funding). To Geisel’s credit, the admins have been trying to revamp the curriculum to better prepare students for board exams but whether it helps remains to be seen.

I will be deleting my account after this in case this is identifying but if a I had a choice of coming to Geisel or going to another mid level med school, I would choose the other school. Don’t get me wrong, I met some of my best friends here and Geisel has its perks but from my perspective Geisel is currently riding on name recognition to get its students into good residencies (and it struggles to do so other than for internal medicine/primary care).

Any tips for CS majors from upperclassmen?,Dartmouth17,"CS1 and CS10 are not particularly intense in terms of amount of coding, but they can be intense if you’ve never programmed before.

CS50 is a *lot* of coding in C; I recommend pairing it with easy courses if you don’t want to be miserable.

CS30 (discrete math) and CS31 (algorithms) are really more like math classes, as you’ll do little to no coding. Both are quite a bit of work, and have tricky problem sets (though CS31 is substantially harder, at least it was for me).

In terms of how to study, I’d just recommend being curious and wanting to understand what’s going on under the hood. Especially when you get to coding in C, you’ll need a solid understanding of pointers, and a good mental model for what the computer is doing. 

In terms of the upper level courses, I can just say what I enjoyed:
CS57 with Sean Smith (Compilers) was a lot of coding, but was amazing.
CS58 with Sean Smith (Operating Systems) was also a lot of work but was super interesting.
CS76 with Devin Balcom (Artificial Intelligence) was interesting, a lot of different problem solving methods. The peer review process was surprisingly useful. 
ENGS 91 / CS71 with Simon Shepherd (Numerical Methods and Computation) was fascinating. He’s an excellent lecturer and the assignments are not too difficult, but explain the course material well.
CS61 (Networks). I took this from Sergey Bratus. He had super interesting stories, but if you need lectures to understand materials, he wasn’t the best explainer. He was very helpful for debugging issues with the final project though. 
CS65 (Smartphone Programming). I didn’t take this course but from friends that did, it was quite easy and not particularly valuable (you can learn the material on your own easily, unlike some others).
CS56 / ENGS 31 this course was pretty fun. The professor you get will determine your experience. Eric Hansen is good; I can’t speak to Luke.

I’d say if you have a strong math background and a bit of coding experience, CS1 and Econ 1 could be a reasonable first quarter; if not you may want to not combine them your first term.

Humanities 1+2 vs Writing 5+Seminar,,"I took Writing 5 + seminar track, and I had two vastly different experiences in each class:

* Writing 5 - worst class I've taken at Dartmouth. Boring, repetitive, and useless. The professor was a nice guy, but bad at his job. It was really clear to the whole class that he was here doing research, and the class was a secondary responsibility he had to do.
* Freshman Seminar - awesome class! I took an art history course (I'm a CS major), and I had an absolute blast in this class. Great prof, really interesting subject, and cool art to look at.

I've heard really great things about Humanities 1+2. If you have any interest in taking that sequence, I highly recommend applying. Aside from my own bad experience with Writing 5, I have heard a lot of other people say their Writing 5 classes were really poorly done. I have never heard anything negative about Humanities 1+2.

It’s challenging — there’s more reading and writing than in most alternatives, but there’s also more freedom to explore the things that interest you and develop your own style. It primes you well for upper-level courses — in all departments — and in that way really is one of the best introductions to Dartmouth you can get. As a caveat, know that the composition of your 16-person discussion group — members’ personalities and willingness to engage each other, take risks and so on — has an outsize influence on your experience, but that’s the case with any Writing 5/Seminar and is made better by the fact that yours would be a self-selected group — one chock full of ambitious, hard-working students led by a professor who’s got a real desire to be there listening to and pushing you.

You’re exposed to literature, film, music and often artwork from many different traditions and through guided discussion connect them to embark on what I believe can be an inspiring exploration of the human psyche — drives, fears, doubts, etc.

admissions question,RoidRange,"The more exceptions you have on your transcript the ""worse"" it is going to seem. The more ""ifs, ands and buts"" your application has, the more it sets it apart from the average applicant. You should take a step back and think about it this way: The average applicant to Dartmouth is going to have a 3.9, a high ACT or SAT score, and out of school achievements through sports, music, theatre, or service. Even then it is about a 4% acceptance for the general population. That is the average applicant. By not taking four years of Math or English, you are now no longer an average applicant but at a disadvantage. A community college, online course etc will not be considered in the application process for non transfer undergraduate. I would take math, if it is too late it is too late but you will be at a non negligible disadvantage without 4 years of math, there is nothing your counselor can write that will mitigate that completely. There are plenty of online resources you should familiarize yourself with if you are getting bogged down in the application process.

***AP research instead of AP Math is a terrible, terrible choice in terms of admissions. If it's your passion follow it, you do not need to go to Dartmouth but from an admissions standpoint this is a terrible decision.

-asking questions: ask your interviewer about their time at Dartmouth! What was their favorite class? What was their favorite class that wasn’t in their major? Did they study abroad? What would they have done differently if they could go back and do it again? Favorite tradition? Obviously these should supplement whatever questions you already have about the school, but they can spark interesting conversation if you have enough time

In the end, I found that I enjoyed going somewhere knowing there'd be familiar faces. The frat you hang out at primarily before you rush almost becomes like your local pub in a sense.

One of my close friends tricked me into going to a rush event and I ended actually enjoying it and liked the brothers. So I rushed and got in. It really made my experience better. 

With that being said I have plenty of friends who never rushed that found amazing social scenes elsewhere. In my opinion, those that willingly don't rush are perhaps the most sociable of people because they don't need to buy into a system to make friends.

High School Me never would have thought I'd do either of those things, but there you go...

IMO the D-plan's most useful if you plan on taking a study abroad or have an off-campus opportunity in mind that doesn't happen in the summer. At the very least, it's useful for avoiding Hanover winter if that's not your thing.

Side note, the D-plan was originally made to accommodate the influx of students after Dartmouth allowed women to enroll, but the administration has still not addressed the housing issues to this day. Currently, there is a large shortage of housing for students who want to enroll, causing the administration to limit the amount of students who want to come on campus to two or less terms.

Getting rid of frats? That’s absurd when Dartmouth’s social scene is built on it. Dartmouth’s Greek life is so inclusive and if you got rid of it, the social scene would get even more elitist and exclusive, with friends-only off campus parties happening.


Renaming every Dartmouth building? What’s even the point of this? We have some down right awesome people who did great things for society on these buildings. Kemeny? Rockefeller? Silsby? Black?



Cultural center for black people? Now, I am an avid supporter of BLM, but you can’t dedicate millions to something like this while still ignoring other minorities that suffer like Hispanics, jewish people, and Asians. 



Some of these things are just not feasible. Do you really want free dental and vision? Then fucking vote. So many people acting holier than thou but won’t even vote. Or after Bernie dropped out, they refuse to vote, not even for Biden. Okay, thanks for electing Trump again, idiot.

Questions about Financial Aid,mabrera,"Hey there! Welcome to the Big Green. Another international here on financial aid. From what I understand:

• Unfortunately Dartmouth does consider the Student Contribution part of the aid package. Usually it hovers around $2200. However, keep in mind that you don't necessarily need to pay that money to Dartmouth directly. They take into account full cost of attendance (including books, air fares, the basic stuff you need to survive like soap and shampoo, etc.), so often what they mean by Student Contribution is that you'll have to work to support yourself instead of getting a stipend. Moreover, they need not be leave term earnings; you can work up to 20 hours a week during classes by tutoring, TAing, helping out with Drill or Study Groups, doing research, or working for the admin in some capacity. Without overextending yourself you can easily net $1500 a term that way. And in the end it wouldn't hurt to ask. I know they're always willing to re-asses the awards and they're being especially receptive now with the economic depression.

• You can apply for interim housing every break as long as you're enrolled the term before and/or the term after. If it's only one, they give you a couple days to move in/out; if it's both, they usually allow you to stay the whole break. They don't charge you extra for it. And being international you're basically guaranteed to be approved. There's also a whole program in place to provide meals to those on campus during breaks, and there's ways to be partially or fully subsidized if you're on financial aid.

• I'm pretty sure aid is not contingent on GPA. It's *very* hard to get consistently low grades tho so I wouldn't worry too much.

- Grade inflation is real but it also doesn’t mean it’s a walk in the park. I’m not pre med or STEM so I may not be the best person for this, but my friends in those areas work incredibly hard and As definitely aren’t guaranteed.

Also, I've heard that the Honors courses (Chem 10 or Bio 19) medians tend to be higher due to self-selection. The medians are designed to work in your favor, since classes in general are not curved down, only curved up, so you really don't have to worry about getting a 94 and a B- on your transcript...the more than likely scenario is that you can get like an 85 and a A-.  

So, play to your strengths. If you really like Bio, test into the Honors section of Bio. If you really like Chem, test into the Honors section for Chem. Do both if you're feeling ballsy. Use your resources like TA hours, office hours, tutors etc. 

And, you can take lay-ups to boost your science GPA like Bio 2 or Math 10, and take Physics 3/4 (which is known as ""Pre-Med Physics"") instead of Physics 13/14.

Touchdown, or the Big Red Bear, is the unofficial mascot of Cornell University. The first mascot was a black bear introduced in 1915 by the Cornell University Athletic Association. Three more live bears over the course of approximately two decades also made appearances at Cornell until the live bear was replaced by costumed students some years later. Touchdown appears on the logo for Cornell Athletics, and is represented in a statue erected outside Teagle Hall in 2015.

Math 11? + profs teaching the class,flutegirl2,"Hi! As a math major who also took multivariate/linear algebra her senior year, I advise you to take the *multivariate placement exam* before making your decision. You shouldn't be taking a course for which you already have mastery of the material. However, if your score warrants you taking multivariate calculus at Dartmouth, you should take Math 13, not Math 11.

Most first-year students have no multivariate experience coming into Dartmouth after Calc BC, and thus, are required to take Math 11, which teaches all multivariate curriculum with *no prerequisite multivariate experience.* However, since you have **any sort** of multivariate experience, I *strongly* recommend you take Math 13 instead. I had an amazing time in Math 13 my freshman fall. Plus, it's being taught by a grad student, and most people will agree that the *grad students are like gold in the math department.*

Being in the unique position to take Math 13 your freshmen fall is rewarding in that you get to meet upperclassmen *and* I personally believe the Math 13 grad student will do a better job than all of the Math 11 professors.

Also there seems to be little communication within the department. The same course will learn slightly different things from term to term, even within a given term. I would say that for the intro (3-13) classes, this isn’t as much of a problem. If you get a prof who doesn’t work with your learning style, you can always attend a different section of the same class.

Also, my own physics-major bitterness with the math department aside, I would say you really should be fine in 11 if you’ve already taken MVC. It moves a little fast but it’ll be some review for you while your classmates who have only gone as far as calc BC will be seeing stuff for the first time.

No trip is superior to the others, and it really is all about fit! Do what sounds fun. I would, however, keep the following things in mind:

\-Trips is MOSTLY an orientation program, IN the outdoors. That means (a) that you don't necessarily need to push yourself to your absolute limits, because you'll want to spend time talking and getting to know your trippees and leaders, but also (b) that even the hardest-sounding trips are not impossible if you are in good physical shape and know what you're getting into.

\-Think about the other people who might select your trip type. If you want to be friends with outdoorsy athlete types, opt for a more physically rigorous trip; if you seek introspection and don't love outdoorsy people, think harder about one of the cabin camping options. Pick your trip based on personal fit, but remember that who is on your trip is part of that. Also, don't worry too much about it! Trips does not determine the course of your college career, and you'll have a great time no matter what.

Just like any other greek space, the coed frats are definitely individual organizations, each with a bit of its own ""personality.""

The best way to get a feel of any greek space would be to go to open events they host (Milk and cookies at phi tau is 100% reccomended). Especially spring term freshman year, when a lot of the greek houses will have pre-rush events that you can go to.

I would say you should definitely take a look at the coed spaces, if that's what interests you, though don't necesarily count out the sororities.

The Hopkins Center has amazing performers for a really low cost to students (oh how I miss that really low cost), and Programming Board brings good artists to campus too. There's a huge number of clubs, and if you have an interest that an existing club doesn't meet, it's pretty easy to start your own and get money from the College to do it.

I also will say that athletes/partiers/people who go greek tend to be the most ""socially prominent"" at every single school, but prominence is not success, and you will certainly find friends like you here.

I have some questions for CS majors,chrispyb,"What did you decide?

The CS department is going through some major changes, and is about to be integrated into the Thayer School, which means people will have the opportunity, I imagine, to get a CS degree, or get a full bachelor of engineering with a focus on software engineering. 

CS is a pretty small program, but definitely is rigorous. 

I think being a TA for the lower level CS courses is somewhat competitive. 

Interviews at top companies. CS majors I knew at school: 1 made it rich essentially developing the mobile side of Kayak.com, one quickly grew in the Oracle ranks, 1 was dual econ - went to Bain Cap, an done dude minored and is a product manager at google. 

Career fair would be pretty different in the coming years, with dev companies coming to thayer as the CS program is integrated. People get internships via career fairs, on campus recruiting etc.

The negative would be the program is so small. And hard. CS is recognized as one of the most demanding majors, up there with ENGS and Music

I wasn't a CS person, was ENGS. I chose Dartmouth over Cornell, because of the environment the school offered as a whole. 

Dartmouth does have a Frat / Party scene, which I was a part of, but there's plenty to do outside of that. I was in the wind ensemble, I rowed for a year, I was on the forestry team, I worked on the Appalachian trail for a summer, I was treasurer for my fraternity.

The trick is finding all of the opportunities that you want to take, there are so many it's often easy to miss the ""perfect"" ones until you're about to graduate.

I agree with /u/cyclonicyoh - everyone is incredibly busy from all the activities outside of schoolwork. And it can be challenging to find exactly the right opportunities to get involved with.

Other opportunities include a vast array of extracurriculars including clubs, programs, acapella & musical groups, just about anything you can dream up mostly. We even have a circus club. There are over 400+ clubs at this point, and even more professional development & pre-professional programs if you look for them. Every department is working on helping students and often they overlook the redundancy in programs which you can use to your benefit if you can find similar programs and compare. 

Unfortunately like many other campuses, the extra curriculars aren't tracked in a central database like classes are but the difference is at Dartmouth, a lot of those programs can set you on career paths or just give you some of the most amazing experiences. I've had the opportunity to travel abroad multiple times for my major and for just random other skills I happened to want to acquire. Dartmouth gives ample opportunity to use funding to help accomplish anything you want to dream of.

* Some of the best professors in the country

* Intellectual and driven student body

* Vast and varied resources for students

* Clear focus on undergraduate students although grad students are present and serve as an additional resource for undergrads

* Great research/internship opportunities

* D plan gives students flexibility in their academic schedules and allows them to have other academic/career/life experiences

* Great alumni/career network

* Greek houses provide additional opportunities to make new friends, find support, and volunteer in/around Hanover

* Located in beautiful Hanover, NH where there's always something to do outside

Bad:

* Terms are 9-10 weeks long, so classes are short and intense (although this could really go either way...)

* ""Dartmouth bubble"", i.e. smart students, intelligent faculty, local community of alumni and retired faculty --> easy to forget about the ""real world""

* High tuition (but good financial aid)

* As is the case at any other institution, administration can be slow to respond to problems; financial aid, registrar, other offices are frustrating to work with

* Greek houses can provide students with opportunities to get into trouble (but let's face it, those kids would still get into trouble even if the frats/sororities were abolished)

Hello! What are some things (good and bad) about Dartmouth that I should know before I apply?,swifty2988,"Dartmouth '10 here.  I think it's an okay institution, but it can be one of the best schools in the country for certain types of people, but also one of the worst for others.  If you're very career minded and don't mind following a specific hive mind for about 4 years (that's not necessarily a bad thing, most people are like that), well, I would first advise you to try and get into one of the schools with a better brand name because you'll definitely need all the advantages you can get in this economy.  But aside from that, Dartmouth has a strong community and a lot of people obviously fit in and love it, so the chances are good that you will enjoy it as well.

It is not a great school for those quiet people who have immense difficulty building a personal, social brand.  You know the types I'm talking about.  Dartmouth doesn't really offer an experience outside of academics that is meaningfully different from what those people could get at other schools.  Needless to say, there are wildly introverted and socially eccentric people in this world - Dartmouth is 100% not the school for them.

The school is also not necessarily anti-intellectual, but it's certainly not that intellectual and very career-centric.  Greek life is actually a lot of fun and welcoming.  Chances are very, very good that you will find a niche within that system if you so choose.  But if you don't?  You will experience something pretty harsh.  A lot of Dartmouth students and alumni love the school, but there's also a sizable minority that hates it.  My honest opinion?  I think there's just a little bit too many class divisions within the Dartmouth community, since social acceptance and class kind of go hand in hand.  This has always been the case, even in the real world.  And I say this as someone who was embraced by the Greek community.

You just really have to know the kind of person that you are before you can establish whether or not this school will be a good fit for you.  And to be honest, that's an extremely tall order for a 17 or 18 year old.  Don't expect to get every assumption correct, but do at least try to think about the school and do your research before you make your decisions.

Hello! What are some things (good and bad) about Dartmouth that I should know before I apply?,stringyfellow920,"Yes, I went to Dartmouth. 

I wouldn't know where to begin with ""insider"" information. Each student's experience is intensely personal which makes it inherently difficult to describe the school in any one way. I was very academically focused which is, I think, reflected in my response to your question. The best way to get a representative idea of the school is to ask the question that you already have to as many students and alumni as possible. Somewhere in that mix of answers you'll begin to get an idea of what your Dartmouth experience might be.

I do agree with the other poster, but I also think that what she (I'll assume based on the username, apologies if otherwise) said could be said of any school. That's part of the college experience: figuring out who you are and who you want to be. It's a challenging process for everyone.

As much as it might feel like you're stuck after your freshman year, you can always start again.  
  
There IS somewhere you will be able to be yourself, I guarantee it. 4,000 might seem small, but that's still a lot of people. You just have to be willing to put yourself out there and go looking for it.

Everyone at Dartmouth is smart, but more than that everyone's got SOMETHING that sets them apart from the 20,000 other kids who applied but didn't get in. Meet as many people as you can and figure out what their something is, and be extremely careful not to put anyone into a box just because they're in a certain frat, club, team, etc. Everyone you'll meet is incredible in some way, and during your four years you have an AMAZING opportunity to be surrounded by them, learn from them, share with them, and grow with them.

Also, after biking around in the city (I'm hanging out in Brooklyn right now) and growing up in the South, I can say the drivers in the Upper Valley (Hanover / Lebanon area) are just really great to cyclists. 

Also, if you are trying to leave Hanover you can take the Dartmouth Coach, the Amtrak out of White River Junction (3 miles from Hanover), or pick up a puddle jumper from Lebanon airport.

Foreign language requirement,EWheelock,"1. I think Spanish and Italian are generally more straightforward than many.  Spanish is also a really useful language (world's fourth most spoken language, after English, Chinese, and Hindi).

2. Hopefully someone can correct me if I'm wrong, I think that if you take an easier language, that really just means you are expected to progress further by the time you get through the third quarter.  So picking an easy language might not make it that much easier to satisfy the language requirement.  

3. Given 1 and 2, the best plan is probably to pick a language that you have some motivation for, whatever that is.  You like the way it sounds.  You want to go there sometime.  You had a crush on someone in third grade who came from the corresponding culture.  You want to read original scientific papers in that language.  You like that country's pop music.  You plan a future career in XXX and you'll be doing business with people from that country.  Whatever.

4. Unless you have some sort of head start on it, like if you lived in community where people spoke it so you got used to the sound of it even if you didn't understand it.

Dartmouth Placement Tests,dew71,"1. For physics u don’t need AP credit to take 13&14. AP credit gives u credit for 3&4 which are the physics classes premed students usually take to satisfy their physics requirements. If your interested in engineering or physics or science definitely take 13 and 14. You’ll get a lot more out of it. 15 and 16 are the honors version which I took and really enjoyed bc the class was small and I had a super strong background in physics from AP in high school. If you do well on the placement test definitely give it a go. They always offer 15 and 13 in the same time slot so you can drop down if needed. 15 covers material in 13 and 19 which helps u get ahead if ur a physics major. 

2. I have a friend that placed out of 13, 22, and 23 and is doing just fine. He emailed the math department head to get special placement tests for ones they didn’t have online.

As a math/CS double major, I placed into 8. A couple times I wished I would've taken the placement to get bumped up to 11, but I'm glad I didn't. Math 8 is a VERY rigorous course. As is 13. You will work very hard in both courses, but they set a very solid foundation for high-level math classes. I have friends who took 11 (which is more or less a combination of the two) and say a very similar thing, but I can't imagine taking both in one term. I have even more friends that have placed out of 22 and 23, but they're the incredibly rare exception. Don't make the jump unless you have years of experience with the material under your belt. I personally took 24, so if you have learned some of the content in math 13 and 22 already, that class will likely be fun for you. Do 24, and also do the 20/40/70 track if you're interested in high-level statistics.

I placed out of the language requirement. No regrets there. It's the only reason why my double major is possible, and has also opened me up to a possible minor to go with it. On the other hand, if you're interested in taking part in a foreign study program (FSP) while at Dartmouth it might help to take one term to review the language if you're not as sharp as you used to be.

Location of Dartmouth??,veteranshipper,"TL;DR Dartmouth is a place where you can be a big fish in a little pond. There's plenty of opportunity that pops up in unexpected places; it may just not look exactly like what it would look like in Austin because it's rural and the patients' needs are different here. 

Dartmouth Hitchcock is a twenty minute bus ride away from Dartmouth campus. It's the only Trauma I center in like a three hour radius and serves all of VT, NH, Western Mass, and Maine, and has lots of volunteering opportunities that are easy to get. You can learn how to scribe as part of the Patient Support Corps, work as a hospitality volunteer, watch kids, escort patients to scans, whatever floats your boat. NSS runs a really competitive shadowing lottery every term, but there are TONS of doctors who are part of the program, so you have the opportunity to shadow someone new every term if you wanted and can get tons of hours in. They also have an off-term database, which is a compilation of everywhere Dartmouth pre-meds have worked in their off-terms. The med students are always looking to get people involved in their events (bc they want our $$ lol), and every term they plan the Physicians for Human Rights Conference, which is held in January. There's the Good Neighbor Health Clinic, Project 439, Dementia Scholars, Cancer Scholars, Blood Drives, Kidney Dialysis Club (or something), Access Dartmouth, and you can apply to be part of the Dartmouth EMS, or, if you're a huge skier, part of Ski Patrol, or, if you're crunchy af, as a Wilderness First Responder. Because there are very few grad students and med students don't really do research, professors welcome undergrads into their labs and research is easy to get, and you don't have to do it for free. You won't just be a lackey running PCR in a lab and labeling agar plates--you'll have a lot of opportunity to *do* something tangible.",9,,False,fm73vgb,False,False,1585812276.0,2020-04-02 02:24:36

People who live in LLCs seem to have made lots of closer relationships with the people on their floors than people in the regular housing system (in my observation).

Best food delivery app for campus?,tasukete_onegai,"Sadly, Hanover being in the middle of nowhere comes with the sad reality of rare food delivery services on campus and none of the main food delivery apps, so enjoy your time in civilization while you can. That being said, Dominos delivers directly to dorms up to 3 AM (not that I know from personal experience \*cough cough\*), which is at least better than nothing. I've also heard that Boloco (the Hanover Chipotle) now does delivery as well. Finally, there's Snackpass, which lets you order food online for pickup and works for all the local restaurants on the Main College street, which is at least better than nothing. They have a section for restaurants that deliver as well, which I believe only has one (Jewel of India). 

For all of you planning on hibernating this winter and want some groceries, Instacart does deliver (god bless) for grocery shopping. Additionally, there's a student-run app called SipIt that put out a card for their services in the dorms, so I think they're legit? Feel free to comment on your experience with them if you'd like. They mostly do more general CVS delivery though so not sure about the variety of fresh fruits from there. 

More recently, the Dartmouth App GET Mobile (AKA the one you use to check your negative balance of DBA) now lets you order food for pickup at the HOP so you don't have to stand in line, which is a nice quality of life improvement in itself. 

Please please pleaseeee let me know if I'm missing anything or better yet, if anyone could get UberEats or any other food delivery services to expand their services into the area ASAP, that would be much appreciated :,)

Help choosing a major: psychology or neuroscience?,GyanTheInfallible,"Hi there! Dartmouth does not require you apply to a degree-awarding programme before admission. You’ll select courses your first year that will help you determine or refine your intellectual interests, and you’ll spend time in settings that will allow you to judge whether the culture of a given department suits you. Which major you ultimately decide to pursue is dependent on a variety of factors, including your career aims, the special seminar offerings (culminating experiences and the like) that line up with your four-year stay, &c.

That said, maybe I can provide some information more specific to your situation. While I highly recommend you keep your options open until Dartmouth allows you to declare (second term of your second year), if you’re set on either Neuroscience and Psychology, know that the departments are not distinct. The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences awards both degrees, and faculty that tend to teach for one also offer courses for the other. A couple of the introductory courses serve as prerequisites for either major and fulfil multiple other college distributive/pre-health requirements. The Stats course, Psych 10, is a good example. Take that class early and speak with your classmates, as they’ll be a mix of Psychology and Neuroscience majors and can give you some cool insider information. Your professor will be able to help there too. 

Then you’ll likely want to take both the ‘core’ introduction to the Psychology major, Psych 1 and the ‘core’ introduction to the Neuroscience major, Psych 6 (though you can substitute this with Biology 34 if it’s more convenient). As hinted at, Neuroscience at Dartmouth accommodates and in some cases requires courses taught in several other disciplines — Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science — to complete, so you’ll meet lots of different people. As with Psychology, you’ll develop your sub-concentration in consultation with your major advisor later on, and those specialised courses will be taught in the Neuroscience department (all Neurosciences courses are labelled ‘PSYCH’ courses).

All majors and departments at Dartmouth have their draws and their drawbacks, but you have plenty of time to explore before pulling the trigger. And if you major in Psychology (but not Neuroscience at this time), you can modify your major — do a hybrid degree with courses from Cognitive Science, Music, Linguistics or anything really.

Workload is individual-dependent, though everyone I know has had time to enjoy the great outdoors, to relax and to party, if that floats their boat. Many, including myself, do research and have several campus jobs in addition.

Great inflation is a thing, in some departments more than in others. No comment aside from that.",5,,False,ev9hb95,False,False,1564321687.0,2019-07-28 08:48:07

Help choosing a major: psychology or neuroscience?,GyanTheInfallible,"You’re welcome! I hope you do —

And as to what the other commenter said about ‘curving down’, ie grade deflation, that hasn’t been my experience, but then again, I’m in Linguistics and Chemistry, so those are the two departments whose policies I can speak most to. I find both to have very fair standards, with lots more room for professor discretion as you make your way into upper-level courses.

In general, introductory courses have B or B+ medians, and mid-/upper-level courses have A-/A medians. In economics, for example, some classes are considered ‘prerequisites’ for consulting positions and are much more competitive, so you’ll need to work harder to be above median. In other courses, this isn’t the case. And this pattern is replicated across departments.

Some departments are in peculiar positions and change grading metrics in order to bring them into better step with student demands or job market pressure. Some inflate grades for practical purposes (to keep the programme open). German Studies does this — rose they’ve too few students. Spanish has no issue attracting students and so doesn’t do so, at least any more than is standard for the Ivy-League. Biology has no issue attracting students, but some say they inflate grades, and this might be due to pressure from the pre-Med advising council. I don’t think this is more of a problem here than elsewhere though.",2,,False,eva1yxv,False,False,1564336826.0,2019-07-28 13:00:26

If you take the placement test they will generally place you above the level you are at, and you will likely come in below the median in the class.

Once you’re involved in something, you’ll end up meeting new friends, and then you’ll meet their friends, and their friend’s friends, and sooner or later you’ll end up with a decently sized group of people you enjoy spending time with.

Not being affiliated presents an interesting combination of pros and cons. Sure, you might miss out on meetings on Wednesdays, but just like someone else mentioned, certainly some of your friends will be involved with Greek life and they can pull you right in after meetings end. And if you’re unaffiliated, you’ll never have to worry about the status/popularity of your house, attend required events, consider leadership positions, pay dues, or clean the house. But of course, you’ll also miss out on the fun parts as well. 

TL;DR: Do at least one thing on campus and you’ll meet people.",2,,False,ej765vw,False,False,1553354263.0,2019-03-23 10:17:43
Prospective Student - Greek Life,thestudentsyes,"This is also what I learned when I visited Dartmouth (I wrote a chapter about Dartmouth in my book and linked to it lower in the thread). Dartmouth Greek scene is very intense (heavy drinking, hard partying), but it is actually very inclusive.

If I were attending Dartmouth, I would try to join a fraternity, mostly because they seemed like so much fun.",4,,False,eiytolx,False,False,1553098670.0,2019-03-20 11:17:50
Life at Dartmouth/Hanover,biggreen10,"I was an undergrad and then came back with my wife while she attended Tuck.

Life at Dartmouth/Hanover,sprachkundige,"So, I went to Dartmouth as an undergrad, which is why I'm subbed here, but I think it might be more relevant to talk about my time in law school in a college town.

Most good law schools are in big cities.  And most people don't really like law school, even if they have some fondness for their particular school.  I LOVED law school, and I think most of my classmates felt similarly.  And I think a big part of that is not being in a big city.

When you're in grad school, you're a bit older, a bit more established, and it's easy to treat school like a job.  To show up for class, then leave and go hang out with your ""real friends,"" because you're in New York or Boston or somewhere else where you already know people.  When you're in a town like Hanover, your classmates have to be your real friends, because everyone has moved there for this and can't fall back on established networks.  It creates a sense of school community and camaraderie that, in my mind, is hard to replicate outside the college town environment and adds a lot to the experience. It makes sticking around on campus and going to classes more enjoyable, because you're surrounded by friends who are all going through it with you, and they're happy to be there because they're surrounded by friends, which makes it easier to be happy yourself. It's sort of a happy cycle where people are more likely to buy in to the community because others around them are doing so.

Obviously people's preferences vary, but I really think the small-town thing adds significantly to the experience.

What’s the food like at Dartmouth?,,"The Hop - fucking delicious, but you can also taste the heart attack you're about to induce. Some healthyish options, and a very long line at peak times. 

Collis - Lots of customization options (pasta, sandwiches, stir fry, eggs in the morning), pretty good balance of delicious and healthy. Also can have crazy long lines at peak times. Love them for breakfast, when I actually eat breakfast. 

KAF - Pretty damn good (though in my opinion crazy overrated). Expensive as hell in terms of DBA though, and really long lines at peak times. They used to have these yogurt parfaits that made me believe in true love, then they changed the yogurt brand and I legit cried. 

Foco - It's our dining hall, and the food is sometimes amazing, and sometimes not great (though always decent), and most of the time falls somewhere in between. It has something for everyone, and can honestly be really good sometimes. There are really healthy options, and then there's the dessert section. FYI, those cookies? They're 200 calories each. That's like two keystones, or a game of pong if you're splitting with a partner. It's frankly pretty good, but at the end of the day, it's a dining hall; the food has to sit out for a while, and has to be somewhat bland (if food was as spicy as I liked it, a quarter of the student body wouldn't be able to eat). Gets really crowded in the fall, as it's all freshman know, and once a term they do a special night (e.g harvest dinner in the fall), that is super packed, but worth it. 

Novak- If you're getting a snack/breakfast here, it's not bad. If you're getting a meal here? Something has gone terribly wrong in your life. 

Snack Bars (e.g Cube/onion)- Junk food galore. Seriously, best junk food ever.

prospective transfer - a few questions,Zeta-X,"I wouldn't consider the college to be super LGBT friendly. There are some queer-friendly spaces -- but those are being gradually compressed, and I think it's safe to say are smaller than most colleges in the US; part of this is the small size of Dartmouth, and part of it is the fact that Dartmouth is relatively conservative (for a college). I've found that the admin is decently accommodating for queer students, but the school culture is decidedly heteronormative and while this certainly isn't all the students, but a lot of social scenes can be very uncomfortable for queer folks. Happy to talk with you more about my experiences as a queer current student if you want to shoot me a DM.

Quarter system -- stressful, can be nice? You're done with classes in 10 weeks, and it can feel like a rollercoaster, but then you're done. Some people like it a lot, some people dread it; it can be pretty exhausting but it has its benefits.

Social scene -- very Greek-heavy. If you are not interested in Greek life, there are other things to do: but frankly, I might recommend considering a different school. As someone who isn't a fan of the Greek scene either, I wish I had chosen a school with more engagement and community outside of frat and sorority basements, as that's where so much of the student body spends a lot of their time, and other social scenes are diminished as a result.",3,,False,eb3mp9b,False,False,1543964729.0,2018-12-04 17:05:29

LGBTQ+ Culture?,AsteroidTicker,"Hi, I’m not LGBTQ+ so I know this isn’t my place to answer, but I figured since this post is a bit older and unanswered it might not hurt to get some input? 

So from what I’ve seen, the Dartmouth community is generally very accepting of the LGBTQ+ community. Most everyone I’ve interacted with has been very pro-LGBTQ+ rights, spaces, etc. I’ve never heard nor seen any explicit anti-LGBTQ+ anything in my time here. Granted, as you said, that doesn’t mean folks who think like that don’t exist on campus, but I’d say that perspective is very much a minority, and one that doesn’t have much voice on campus. 

I wish I could be more help but I know that this really isn’t my place. I’m happy to answer any other questions but I don’t want to be “that guy” for now. 

I really hope you consider Dartmouth!

It also allows you to take whatever term you want off (because you have to be on sophomore summer). This can be a great thing, because you are able to get an internship with less competition; however, fewer places are looking for interns over terms other than summer. Another downside is that it can be the case that you and your friends ‘fall victim to the D-Plan’, meaning that your terms don’t align well. For example, I was off this past fall, and some of my friends that were on in the fall are now off, so I won’t get to see them until the spring. Then again, my plan aligns with other people’s perfectly, so I’ll always be with them.

ATTN: Physics majors or athletes. Looking for feedback about programs.,KidBowser,"Yeah, I’ll take a crack at this. I graduated as an Engineering Physics major not too long ago and was an athlete as well. 

The schedule is tough, but you’re not going to be drowning in work (all of the time). Being a student athlete is rough, there will be some long days and nights, but you don’t have much of a choice in rising to the occasion. You eat enough by pigging out at Foco, drinking TruMoo from Floren, and occasionally swiping an extra snack from the Hop. Tutoring for intro courses is free, courtesy of DP2. Upper level courses will be hard to find a tutor for, so you’re on your own. 

I studied Plasma Physics within the physics department. Unfortunately for you, my favorite professor, Mary Hudson, and her husband in the engineering department, retired not too long ago. That being said, the Physics department has some real characters when it comes to professors, and I enjoyed their personalities, which made the courses much easier to pay attention to. I was a multi season athlete so my availability to do things outside of class was limited, but I did frequent the Plasma Physics Seminars Tuesday afternoons. I was always jealous of the kids who got to go on the astronomy FSP to South Africa (admittedly, I don’t know what season rugby competes in, but this FSP is during the winter term, so something to look in to). I thought the classes were relatively forward. Getting to upper level courses, the material becomes more intense, but I never really had to change my study habits. The class sizes do get pretty small (my PHYS 68 course has 4 kids, me and 3 graduate students), which can make it hard to consult others about homework or topics, but like I said, I didn’t have to change study habits to make it through.

Or, you could not get a red shirt, which would kind of suck, but you’re injury most likely isn’t as bad as one that’ll red shirt you so... :(:(:(: but if you get injured, the trainers are pretty good, and you’ll get some pretty individualized attention. If you don’t wanna play anymore, that’s fine. It’s college, people’s interests and desires change, if rugby ain’t your thing anymore, then there’s no point in doing it.

International applicant that got in! Can someone please help me with these questions?,Joemann4000,"Wow. OK Dartmouth grad here, not a CS major but friends with several. 1) The CS dept at Dartmouth has deep history in AI. We invented AI at Dartmouth in the 1956, I was on campus for the 50th anniversary conference, etc.. CS is a big part of the Science side of Dartmouth, which is very strong considering the ""small liberal arts college"" perception. Dartmouth is ranked low for CS graduate studies because it is primarily focused on undergrad. You'll set a great foundation in CS at Dartmouth and then can move on to Cal Tech, Stanford, MiT, CMU, where ever you want for graduate work. 2) Top companies recruit at Dartmouth every year, same as any where else in the Ivy and similar college tiers. You'll have access to every where you want to go and the CS dept with the help of your other classes will prepare you for it all. 3) Econ is the major at Dartmouth for business/finance aspirations, there is no 'finance' major (unless they've added one?) but you'll have plenty of options within the Econ dept to craft your courses towards finance careers. 4) I work in finance, connections are really helpful for getting in the door at an entry level but not necessary. Those connections plus the on-campus recruiting/preparation should provide ample opportunities for great jobs. 5) I don't think they offer a combo UG and MBA program at Tuck but they may have added one since I've been gone. Tuck is a great school, many friends went there but IMO you're better off doing a joint MS/MBA at a larger school that has great CS and MBA programs. Plus Tuck is an ""older"" school with most applicants over 26. 

If you really want a city experience, then Dartmouth may not be the best choice. That said, it is a beautiful place to live and learn for 4 years. You'll have access to the great outdoors, amazing professors, and some of the most interesting people you'll ever meet. You can spend the rest of your life living in a city and you'll always remember the 4 years you spent in Hanover. Cool things about Hanover: Dartmouth has its own ski resort, golf course, canoe club, and hiking trails/cabins right on campus or very close by. The food on campus is great, usually ranked right behind Cornell (known as the best). The social life is a choose your own adventure ranging from a Capella, to Frisbee, to Varsity sports, outdoor adventures, skiing, club sports, Frats/Greek life, etc... Plus the beer is always free at frat parties. There are very interesting people who choose to study at Dartmouth. I'm sure all the schools you mentioned will have cool people there too, but the folks who choose Dartmouth are truly unique and special in their own way. A friend of mine was a CS minor and wrote apps in college for the iPhone for an upcoming travel company and was a millionaire at age 27. Another is a decedent of Martha Washington and Robert E Lee that ended up at the top of her math major class.

If you need to get a city, Boston is 2.5 hours by bus and the Dartmouth Coach goes there 5 times/day.  My advice is to use your formative college years to find and explore your passion in addition to your CS work and job prospects, don't let the bright lights/big city steer you awry from who you are and whom you will become. You'll spend the next 50 years of your life in a city working around the clock, enjoy the fresh air while you can.

International applicant that got in! Can someone please help me with these questions?,Dartmouth17,"Dartmouth Engineering / Computer Science '17 here.

1) Dartmouth has a very strong CS department. Its engineering department is somewhat weaker than comparable schools, but its CS program is very good. The faculty in the CS department is very accomplished and some of them are quite well known in their fields (for instance, Professor Cormen literally wrote the book on Algorithms which is used throughout the english-speaking world).

2) Job opportunities are very good. Lots of big companies recruit at Dartmouth; tech companies (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, Palantir, etc.) generally come to the Thayer Engineering School career fairs, so you'll want to go to those. Depending on the company, they may even send interviewers to campus to do the first round of interviewing. I had my first round interview with Microsoft on campus. It is true that they look for practical experience, but coursework is honestly enough. You'll still have to go through the interview process to get hired in C.S., but there's not really an expectation that you code outside of your classes. Full disclosure: I'm going to work for Google after graduation, and while they do send recruiters to Dartmouth for career fairs, they funnel everyone through their online process.

3) I know people who have double majored in CS and Economics. It'll be busy but it's possible.

4) Can't really speak to this.

It is weaker than many other programs in terms of the depth you gain in your particular field. A lot of engineering programs have you taking nothing but engineering classes for most of your undergraduate time, and that's not the case at Dartmouth.

Blitzmail, an early form of email, was invented here and used by students before most other universities. One of the first major AI conferences was held here.

How do I prepare for Math 11? I'm terrified.,Dartmouth17,"So first off, I didn't take Math 11, I took math 8 and 13. That said, I think there are some basics of math class learning that I can share.

1st, and hopefully obviously, go to class. Pay attention in class. This is where you gain the knowledge that sets you up for the homework. If the professor says a thing that doesn't make sense to you, probably half the class is also confused, so raise your hand and ask, it will be helpful to you and others. Also take good notes, as this will be your reference (along with the book) when doing homework. 

2nd, either have or make friends in the class to do homework with. Often times when one person gets stuck, the other can unstick them. Do the homework with plenty of time, as this is where the real learning happens (at least for me, results may vary). If Math classes are still using WebWork like we did, you have unlimited tries to get the right answer, and it'll be a fairly low percentage of your grade. The point of this step is to make sure you understand all the material.

3rd, use office hours. Professors have quite a bit of time each week set aside for office hours, and sometimes teaching assistants hold office hours as well. Don't come to office hours without having put some honest effort into solving the problem. They're not meant for you to have your hand held through the assignment - that isn't helpful for you or them. 

4th, maybe get a tutor. The tutor clearinghouse has a list of people who sign up to tutor classes. The list isn't infinite so sign up early in the term (I'm not sure if you can sign up now, but ASAP) if you think you'll need tutoring to get you through the class. For students on any financial aid or athletes, tutoring is free, the college pays tutors $9 / hour. If you aren't on financial aid, you arrange directly with the tutor how much you'll pay them. Same deal here as with office hours - don't have them hold your hand through each assignment, or you'll be lost on the exams. 

Oh, about exams. You can expect 3 exams: 2 midterms and a final. Each midterm will be 2 hours long (or possibly 3) and the final will be 3 hours. They're designed to spread out the curve, not for everyone to score in the 80s and 90s. My Math 8 class, the median on the first midterm was 60%. So don't worry about raw score too much, worry about where you fall relative to the median.

Well that turned into basically my guide for success in STEM courses in general. Hopefully it's helpful to you. Enjoy trips! (Also you should come to CnT, basement of Robinson Hall on Monday night at 10.) Best of luck on the transition to college learning, and maybe I'll see you there in a couple weeks.",3,,1472398489.0,d700tej,False,False,1472398267.0,2016-08-28 10:31:07

Prospective Student - Help?,Dartmouth17,"Hi PickleMastert69,

Glad to see you're thinking about coming to Dartmouth. First, the winter is all about preparation. If you come to Dartmouth dressed how you would at home, obviously it'll be terrible. You need to invest in a good coat, and probably a good pair of long underwear to put under your clothes. Typical winter weather is between 0º and 25ºF, with nights getting sometimes as low as -20º or so, as well as the occasional colder spell when it's more frigid in the day. It's very manageable though. The hardest part for me is walking to breakfast and classes in the morning, when the air is still pretty cold from the night; it hurts a little to breathe, but breathing through a scarf helps.

As to your second question, I have a friend who rows on the crew team, and he manages to still have a social life, and he's a cool guy. Beyond that, I don't have much for you.

"What do you think about these comments by Amanda Childress, Sexual Assault Awareness Program coordinator at Dartmouth",jisa,"Good grief. Inside Higher Education quotes Linda Farstein as an analyst/consultant, with no mention of her history as a New York prosecutor A checkered career at best, given her appalling conduct in the Central Park Jogger case where she abused her position to help railroad five teenagers into wrongful convictions for rape. Years later, she showed no remorse or ability to objectively review evidence, by opposing the NY DA's recommendation to vacate the wrongful convictions.

Which isn't to say that Ms. Childress should be judged by the ideological company she keeps, but I am appalled by her words that safety is more important than a fair and equitable process. I am all for expelling students after an evidence-based, fair and equitable process. An allegation is evidence. An allegation may even be all the evidence required in some cases.

>A woman reported that on Sunday, August 11, at approximately 11:15 pm, while 
walking home, she was attacked by an unknown male.  The incident was reported 
to have occurred on Route 10, close to the intersection of Wyeth Farm Road 
(south of Hanover). The woman fought the assailant, who drove away and she then 
called 911.

>The suspect is described as a late 30's to early 40's male, heavy set, 
approximately 5ft 9 inches tall, wearing thin rimmed glasses, having a small 
nose, short dark hair and was balding on top.

>The vehicle is described as a dark colored sedan, possibly carrying Vermont 
plates.

>The incident is under investigation by the Lebanon Police and Dartmouth Safety 
and Security.

>Anyone with information is asked to contact the Lebanon Police at 603-448-1212.

I'm going to be an incoming freshman this fall. What tips do you have for me?,OfTheWater,"[There's no need to go to b@b.](http://i.imgur.com/PR5rU2a.jpg)

* For classes and studying, find a quiet place where you can work and avoid distractions. I like the third floor of the stacks.

* To meet new people, I suggest your regular classes, joining clubs, community service, going to events put on by your UGA (""mandatory"" meetings not included), and tails events.

* Events/fun things to try: On- and Off-Campus Concerts, The Vagina Monologues, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Film/Animation showcases at the end of the term, the Polar Bear Swim, sledding on the golf course, Riverfest, swimming in the Connecticut River, the Montshire Museum of Science (right across the bridge), making the winter carnival sculpture, Green Key, and a bunch of others I probably missed.

* Surviving Academics: Make a **study schedule**, and also make a **break schedule**. Reading and working on something monotonous or suffering from writer's block can leave you high and dry, so remember to take a break in between work. And as much as I haven't followed my own advice, **do not procrastinate**. And when it comes to dense readings, skim the big titles first, then work your way day into finer detail. I enjoyed learning about John Locke, G.W.F. Hegel, Focault, etc., but some of that reading was incredibly dense. If you find yourself rereading something, it's either time to reread it again or a breather.

* Items that are must-haves? I still have my Thayer School of Engineering bottle opener. A pretty sweet memento, if I must say so myself.",5,,False,cb1g45e,False,False,1373664778.0,2013-07-12 16:32:58

As a recruited varsity athlete myself I did not have to go through the process of walking onto a team myself, but I have a few good friends that have decided to walk onto different teams.

My best advice if you want to play soccer at Dartmouth is to send the head coach an email saying how you would love the opportunity to walk onto the team. If that doesn't work out there are a great deal of club sports and inter-murals all year long you can participate in.

Some sports you mentioned like rowing and crew are varsity sports at Dartmouth so I would not get your hopes up to high about just walking on the team with no previous experience, but the majority of the people that do play rugby, have never played before.

Such a big community. I am on financial aid and don't have much spending money and it's nice that the regular weekly trips are free (well I guess you pay with your quarterly activity fee). Basically what happens is you get on the email list for a subclub and then you'll find out about activities. There are too many activities for the amount of free time that you'll have.

There is also an active community interested in organic farming and there's is the Dartmouth Organic Farm where some people live. It's like 10 min bike from campus. I have many friends involved in that.

Regarding the frat scene. I'll give a skewed perspective from someone who is not that into it.

"Bio 11 vs Bio 19 (Bio Major, Pre-Med)",takefive_,"Bio 11 and 19 are fundamentally very different classes. 

11 is a true intro-level course: it doesn’t have a lab, and the topic/theme/professor varies by term. It’s a good choice if you haven’t taken AP Bio or want to take some time to adapt to Dartmouth-style courses. The theme of Bio 11 doesn’t matter for your major concentration, which is another consideration (aka a good option if you want to explore areas of biology that won’t end up being your concentration). As long as you take 11 in your first year (or as your first bio course), it counts towards the major.

12 is one of five foundation courses (alongside 13, 14, 15, and 16): you need 3/5 of these for the bio major, and all except 15 have a lab. The theme of 12 is cell bio, so it’s good if you’re interested in molecular biology, microbiology, or are pre-med. This is typically a large-ish class because so many people need to take it. You can skip 11 and go straight to 12 if you felt comfortable in AP Bio or did well on the placement exam. 

19 is only available for incoming first-years, though it covers the same material as 12. The main difference is class size: 19 is capped at 20-30 students, so if you take 19, you’re guaranteed a small class (small enough that your professor will come to lab, which isn’t true of 12 necessarily). Similar to 12, however, this class is best for freshmen who felt comfortable in AP Bio and have some advanced bio background already. 

If you’re not sure you want to jump straight into a lab-based biology class (which often consists of students from every class year), or want to explore a new area of biology, take 11. If you feel confident in your biology skills/knowledge and want to start with cell bio, apply for 19, and if you don’t get in, you can always take 12 and learn the exact same material.",1,,False,g0tnfxi,False,False,1596918872.0,2020-08-08 15:34:32

There's no comparison. UNR and the rest of the Nevada education system is incredibly broke.

Feel free to PM if you want to hear more, but as much of a ""traditional engineering"" education exists at UNR, barely any students are hired at the places that recruit at Dartmouth.

Given how bad Nevada education is and how underfunded it is, Dartmouth is worth any price difference you have to pay to get out of the state. Not to mention, our state is going to be one of the hardest-hit with coronavirus because of our tourism-based industries, so I am fully expecting the university system to be hit with further budget cuts.

How good is engineering physics at Dartmouth?,arjadre,"I majored in engineering physics and minored in applied math.

(It's worth noting that when I applied, I chose chemistry for my first-choice academic interest. Unlike other schools, Dartmouth doesn't require you to declare a major until sophomore year, and it doesn't have to match the one that you list on your college application.)

I am very happy with the education I received at Dartmouth. Both the Thayer School of Engineering and the Department of Physics and Astronomy have some amazing professors, and my engineering and physics classes were among my favorites. The classes were typically rigorous but well-taught.

The requirements for both the engineering physics major and the physics major are available [here](http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Physics-and-Astronomy). I've summarized the requirements below, although there are more specifics, including particular classes that must be taken, at that link.

Physics major:

- 6 prerequisite classes in math and physics
- 8+ ""major-level"" physics classes

Engineering physics major:

- 8-9 prerequisite classes in math, physics, chemistry, and computing, depending on which computing sequence is chosen
- 5 major-level engineering classes
- 5 major-level physics classes

Unlike the physics major, the engineering physics major potentially offers the opportunity to stay for a fifth year and complete the ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree at the Thayer School of Engineering.

I chose engineering physics because it was the best fit for what I wanted to study in graduate school (atmospheric science/meteorology). During my sophomore year, I was planning to do a physics major, but it turned out that Dartmouth's fluid dynamics course was an engineering course, not a physics course, and it had several engineering prerequisites. Since I had to take several engineering courses in order to take fluid dynamics, it made sense to switch to the engineering physics major. I graduated in 2012, took some time off, and am now working toward a Ph.D. in atmospheric science.

Dining Dollars? DBA? Mealswipes?!?,WildCAT356,"Foco is unique, the meal swipes are mainly designed for use there, but you can use DBA to get into Foco.

At every other place, you're more likely to be using DBA. At these places (like the Hop or Collis), swipes can be exchanged for credit at checkout.

Say I'm at the Hop and my total for dinner comes out to $15. Exchanging a meal swipe at the Hop during dinner hours gives you $10 in credit, so I only have $5 left to pay. Your meal swipe is consumed, and the remaining amount due is drawn from your DBA.

If you don't have enough DBA at any point, you can go negative until your balance is at -$100. After that  you won't be allowed to buy stuff with DBA and will need to charge your balance online.

My personal recommendation is that unless you really are a Foco nut, try the 5 swipes/week + $1000 DBA next term. I've used it every term after my freshman fall and the amount of DBA is really nice and flexible. You can use the swipes for dinners at Foco, which is getting the most out of them.",9,,False,f0tlwba,False,False,1568924588.0,2019-09-19 15:23:08
Dining Dollars? DBA? Mealswipes?!?,lilit829,"So, I think they have switched things up a bit since Class of ‘18 graduated last year. But I can tell you what my experience was. 

___

I was in the “standard” plan my freshman fall and winter (the one where you had like 20 meal swipes and $200 DBA) which really hinders you from eating anywhere other than FOCO. DBA works like a debit card of sorts, you have that amount of “liquid” funds to use in any of be other places that don’t accept meal swipes (like KAF) and also at the places that do (FOCO, Hop, Collis). 

___

My freshman spring I switched to the least restrictive plan (can’t remember the name right now) which would give me around $1,200 DBA and 7 meals swipes a week. This worked perfectly for me. I was able to go to FOCO once a day (usually for dinner since I felt that’s where I got the most of my meal swipes’ worth) and could still freely buy anything that I desired in every other place. I never felt restricted and never ever ran out of DBA. In fact, I would often have $300 or so left at the end of the term which I would then blow on random stuff to take back home or on friends/drill students.  
I know some people did run out and, anyone correct me if I’m wrong, you would have to put in money (just like a debit card) to use DBA again (not meal swipes).",1,,False,f0tkayz,False,False,1568923716.0,2019-09-19 15:08:36

Will a Google Home work on dorm WiFi?,,"Hi! Student IT Help Desk employee here. Dartmouth's wifi has two networks: eduroam and Dartmouth Public. Eduroam is secured with your Dartmouth account, whereas Dartmouth Public is free and open to everyone. 

Unfortunately, smart speakers and game consoles don't support eduroam wifi connections, only Dartmouth Public. The public WiFi is usually fine for this, but sometimes it goes down in certain areas, and since it's the public wifi, there's not a lot of pressure for it to be fixed. Currently, East Wheelock's Dartmouth Public network is down, but it'll get fixed eventually. 

If your Google home has issues connecting to the wifi, you can always use it as a regular Bluetooth speaker instead. It probably won't have voice functionality, but it can still play music.

Dartmouth LLC recommendation,jaywhyme,"Hi! I lived with the thought project for a term, and while it's not very active at all for upperclassmen, the first year community seems strong! It has a lot of events that are more or less optional, so you're involvement is kind of what you make of it. I personally didn't find the discussions very engaging, but it may have just been that the upperclassmen group I was with didn't vibe well.

In my first year I was a Great Issues Scholar, although not one in residence so I didn't live with the others. If you are interested in the program DEFINITELY apply to live in the LLC-- in my year it formed a very strong community and I wished I had. GIS has a mandatory number of events you must attend over the course of the year, but it's pretty low. A lot of its events were catered and honestly all the events I went to were really engaging. I would definitely recommend it, I wished the program lasted more than a year. Alternatively, if you don't apply for the LLC, you'll have a chance to apply for the program once you're on campus in the Fall and you can attend events without living on the floor like I did.

I had one friend who lived on the Thriving Through Transitions floor, and they didn't seem to be very active after the start of the year. Tbh LLCs are worth applying to just because they have some of the best housing anyway.

The events are ""mandatory"" (not actually mandatory) but they're definitely worth going to. Plus, living in the Global Village is nice, you meet cool people.

Dartmouth student accused of 'violence' for op-ed on diversity,Koboldsftw,"While the accusations of violence were extreme, the op-ed was pretty absurd, for a couple reasons.  First of all, it made claims that the proportion of men that applied was much more ham the ones that got the positions.  However, because leadership positions are applied to individually, it could easily be the case that qualified men applied to very few of the positions, leading to the current spread.  In fact, in the past the applications process has actually been slightly biased towards men for exactly this reason.  Additionally it makes the assumption that application quality was equal between genders, which could probably be said if the application pool was very large but definitely cannot be said with a smaller application pool.

The thing that rankled most people however was the base assumption of the piece, that he was good enough to make the trips leadership board if he wasn’t unfairly ruled out because he was a man.  This is the privilege that many of the opinions were attacking.  The deep seated idea that you deserve things like this comes from a uniquely privileged position, and causes people like him to deflect all their problems into other people, instead of accepting that the problem lies within.",7,,False,dtz2n06,False,False,1518157023.0,2018-02-09 00:17:03

Dartmouth student accused of 'violence' for op-ed on diversity,rekt_brownie,"To top this off, it’s hardly unfair to name names in response to this article since Spector had no good reason to names names himself in the article. 

He argues that because the directorate is 80% women, there’s no possible way they could have been selected for merit, ignoring that the application pool was most likely more women since trips tends to get more female applicants than male applicants for whatever reason. Congress is roughly 80% male. Dartmouth faculty is pretty white/male dominated, there’s no way any of them could be qualified right??

He also presents 0 facts or sources in the article besides the email that says he was rejected based on merit (which runs contrary to his claim). This part annoyed me the most because it would be way more legitimate if he could say X% of the applicants were male but Y% of accepted applicants were male. If there was a massive disparity that could open up a line for debate (but the sample size is way too small for this to be a good argument anyways)

When applying for trips a lot of guys were told to apply because it’s slightly easier to get in as a guy because there aren’t enough guys applying, which also directly contradicts the article. 

I agree that some of the personal attacks aren’t warranted, but this article also isn’t really one that presents a good argument or encourages a fair debate and it just reeks of entitlement and comes in with a very sexist and racist base position (that minorities couldn’t be qualified for this on their own merits).

I'm actually very interested in studying AI at Dartmouth. What's crazy is I think I sat in on a class about making Chess AI like 2 years ago, but I don't remember the professor's name. Is he the only one?

How is the AI scene at Dartmouth? I've heard good things about the intimate size and the CS professors. Are there research opportunities or any clubs that pertain to it? 

I'm also into study abroad, but I'm not sure if CS or AI would really have many opportunities abroad. Do you know anything about that?

Though most people don't have cars on campus nor leave it to eat that frequently, because the on-campus dining is really good and the small variety of options we have in our downtown is sufficient for times you want to eat off campus.

Overall, I'm from a densely suburban area, where anything I could want is a ten minute drive away, twenty at the absolute most. I was concerned about Dartmouth because of how small it is. Now that I've been here for a few years I never want to leave, and I couldn't imagine going someplace where there was less of a campus/community feel to the entire school. The reason it feels like that here is that we're not in a city -- my friends who've visited from Manhattan schools say this is like something else entirely and a lot of them wish they'd had an undergrad experience like mine. 

Of course, YMMV, but in my opinion, as soon as you get used to it you can't help but love it. Plus, you've always lived in a city and you probably will after you graduate -- why not step out of your comfort zone for a few years? ",9,,False,ddh0j39,False,False,1486523364.0,2017-02-07 21:09:24

You sound like me. I'm doing pretty well. Look at the gender inclusive frats & Amarna. They're pretty much just a bunch of friends hanging out and having a good time. Not like your ""traditional"" greek scene. I'm a Phi Tau and it's working out pretty well for me! I don't drink, I don't party, I'm pretty quiet, and that's where I fit in!

Hmm... I'm not sure exactly. My circle is LGBTQ+ friendly, but I think it really depends on who you hang out with. Check out Amarna (undergraduate society). My girlfriend (who's bi) says ""at bare minimum you'll be tolerated. Some places celebrated. There are a handful of assholes who you're gonna find anywhere. Compared to other schools? Fuck yeah, we have to include ASU on that list, you know?""

Prospective student wondering if Dartmouth is the right fit for me,Dartmouth17,"> I'm not really a huge partier and am pretty introverted in general so I'm worried that my lack of interest in drinking/greek life will isolate me,

I definitely understand your concern—I also am pretty introverted and not much of a partier. However, I've been able to find several solid social circles that don't revolve around parties and drinking. Specifically, I've found the DOC to be a great non-drinking-focused social group.

> the potentially 'cutthroat' nature of academic competition

I agree with /u/somanayr, I haven't seen *any* cutthroat academic competition. Dartmouth has a large cultural aversion to bragging (it's acceptable to call someone out on a ""self-call"", i.e. a brag). In the classes I've taken, students have help each other understand if they can, even in classes with a fixed-median. I think it's somewhat a point of pride that Dartmouth students don't abandon decency and sanity for a GPA. ",8,,False,ctiwkwx,False,False,1438087479.0,2015-07-28 07:44:39
Prospective student wondering if Dartmouth is the right fit for me,lostbrontesister,"Alum here. I was also not a partier and still don't really drink much (too many alcoholics in the family). You can definitely find communities where you will fit in. I second what some of the other commenters have said about the mixed-gender fraternities--I was in Alpha Theta which is a coeducational fraternity known for playing board games and hosting alcoholic-free baked goods nights. Amarna and Phi Tau are similarly low-key. Tabard is LGBTQ friendly but a bit more prone to drug use.

Alpha Theta is also known for having a large LGBTQ population--many of the other coeds are also known for this and I certainly had many LGBTQ friends who were in traditional fraternities/sororities as well (as well as some non-affiliated friends). I would say that Dartmouth is quite LGBTQ friendly. There is also a new LGBTQ affinity house that opened I think last year (or the year before? I've lost track). And Dartmouth may be ""more conservative"" than some schools but the conservative population is still smaller than the liberal one--or at least the Republican club is less active than the Democratic one. Again, it's about finding your community. There are certainly assholes and communities of assholes at Dartmouth--you can find the ""old boys club"" pretty easily. But there are also many communities that are very liberal.

There's actually a pretty aggressive anti-cutthroat culture at Dartmouth. As some other people have said, bragging is highly discouraged. This is very different than other Ivys. It's very laid-back. Except a bit for the pre-meds. But even then it's nothing like many other schools.

Hanover is a small, isolated but beautiful town. If you like the outdoors, you will love it there. If you like cities, the nearest one is 3 hours away on the Dartmouth Coach. Almost no one has a car (don't bring a car there is no parking). That said, there are lots of great shows and concerts that come through the Hop and really, you'll be too busy to notice the lack of city life.

Better student reviews of Dartmouth,quinyd,"###Warning: this is going to be long

When skimming through the pdf you linked a few questions stand out. Most of these just seem really unnecessary for student reviews. 

> - What has surprised you the most about your professors
> - Tell us about your favorite professor.
> - Tell us about your worst professor(s). (cue: now’s your time to rant!)

These three questions i couldn't care less for. I could see a lot of students just ranting off (they are even encouraged). It is extremely individual if you like a professor or not, and even though a lot of people have had good experiences, doesn't mean you will. 

> - Would you go to class if you didn’t have to?

Doh, of course not. But technically you don't *have to* but in order to pass it is a *very* good idea to do so.  

> - Will you be noticed if you’re not paying attention? Do you have to go to class?

First part seems alright, but second part is basically the same as above. 

> - What is the grade distribution typically like? (ex. A: 30%, B: 40%, C: 20%, D/F: 10%)

How should I know. I'm not studying all the grades and calculating percentages.

> - What are people in the major like? How would you
stereotype them?

It is probably a good idea not to create stereotype and at least at my major, people are very different from semester to semester. 

> - How long does it take to walk from one end of campus to the other? Is it easy to get around? (think walk, bike, shuttles, public transportation, car...)

I don't know, why would it matter?

> - How is student health?

Well I'm always healthy but some people are not. How should I know.

> - Is it easy to make friends? How did you make friends?

If you are introvert, then probably no. But again this is so individual that i could not care less what others experience have been.

> - Who wouldn’t fit in?

I don't know, I might fit it but the next person doesn't? seems like a useless question. 

> - What do people do for fun other than party? What about you specifically? 

So individual, one group of people might play computer while another plays table-top games. Or others play football. You would need a really large sample group for this to make sense. Having it as an open question (rather than closed) would be useless. 

> - What are the guys/girls like (smart, fun, attractive, interesting, nice...)?

One persons attractive is another persons unattractive. (hope it makes sense)

> - Do people go home a lot?

To like their dorm or parents or what? Like after class or in vacations? 

> - Tell us a good story! 

Really? Se useless, couldn't care less. 

> - How are non-partiers viewed (weird/nerdy, shy/loner, normal...)?

What do you classify as a *party*? Do you have to get drunk? Couldn't you be shy or nerdy and still be a *partier*

> - Do the Greeks have a big presence? Do people like them?

Like people from Greece or like people in a fraternity/sorority?

> - Tell us a good party story!

Please don't. I don't care for your so-called *epic* drunk tale.

> - How hot are the girls/guys? Is it easy to hook up if you’re a guy/girl?

What is this, a dating site? Seems useless.

> - Is weed common? What about other drugs? 

Interesting but phrased wrong. If it is about ""Drug Safety"" make it easy for the newer to if drugs have a presence at the school, but how much is *common* like 50% smoke weed or like 5%?

Hope my 2cents are helpful.

Better student reviews of Dartmouth,adamzerner3,"1) Although some of these questions may depend on the individual/instance, you can extrapolate from say 20 people talking about their experiences, and most students can speak to what is typical.

2) There's a difference between not knowing for sure, and not being able to give a good approximation. I think that for the purposes of a college applicant, a good approximation is fine (it's certainly better than nothing).

3) I think that most people do care about the things you say don't matter (based on talking to a lot of people about the questions on my site).",1,,False,ch134eq,True,False,1398368994.0,2014-04-24 14:49:54
Better student reviews of Dartmouth,quinyd,"1) I wouldn't say so, but the people that actually do students reviews are probably likeminded and therefore their answers will show a similarity. 

2) Sure. 

3) People are different :) i normally never do things like student reviews and I know a lot that don't, so the answers you will get from student reviews will be from a specific group of people which will skew the results.

Academe's Extinction Event:
> The academic study of literature is no longer on the verge of field collapse. It’s in the midst of it. Preliminary data suggest that hiring is at an all-time low. Entire subfields (modernism, Victorian poetry) have essentially ceased to exist. In some years, top-tier departments are failing to place a single student in a tenure-track job. Aspirants to the field have almost no professorial prospects; practitioners, especially those who advise graduate students, must face the uneasy possibility that their professional function has evaporated.

Got In - But I Know Nothing,anahitakodali,"I'm a premed 23' at Dartmouth! I can honestly tell you that it has been an incredible experience. The premed advisors here are incredibly accessible, professors are amazing teachers, and this is coming from someone who never even took AP chemistry in highschool. 

There is a lot of flexibility in what majors and minors you can choose. I'm able to major in biology, minor in WGSS, and graduate without having to take a gap year between undergrad and med school (it takes some serious planning, but for the most part, you'll be able to do whatever you want, especially if you're willing to take a gap period). 

Undergraduate research is a huge deal here, if you're at all interested. I've been working in a lab from my fall quarter, and I'll be continuing even during spring term, which I'm sure you know is online. I applied for the Women in Science Program  and got in, but honestly, I was able to get offers from labs just by emailing profs and telling them that I was interested in their work. 

The unique Dplan is good in many ways and bad in others. You'll get to take terms off to study for MCATs and apply to med school if you decide you don't want a gap year. However, premed courses are only offered certain terms (for example, chem 5 - gen chem 1 - is only offered fall and winter). Thus, you have to be careful about when you're taking premed classes. 

There are also several clubs and society's made for premed/STEM students. As I mentioned, I was a WISP intern. I also am an editor for the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science and a part of the Nathan Smith society, which is a premed society (it basically just sends out internship and speaker opportunities on campus). However, this hasn't stopped me from doing other things that I enjoy on campus! 

Finally, Dartmouth isn't at all cutthroat when it comes to premeds. I haven't really experienced any toxic premed culture that many of my friends who go to other prestigious institutions complain about. 

Overall, I highly encourage you to consider Dartmouth for premed! Best of luck making your decisions! Please feel free to reachout if you have any  questions.",3,,False,flo4pan,False,False,1585331563.0,2020-03-27 12:52:43

Everything else is also pretty flexible. I'm able to major in Linguistics, modified with Chemistry. Pretty much any professor will let you research under them if you show interest in their work.

Got In - But I Know Nothing,anahitakodali,">SUNY

When I was making my decision, I was between Dartmouth and almost a full ride to the University of Pittsburgh. I decided to go to Dartmouth for a couple key reasons: culture, accessibility of research, class size/professors, and Ivy name brand. 

Like I said, Dartmouth's premeds aren't toxic in the same way that premeds are in a lot of different schools, which may not be a big deal to you, but as someone who likes competition thats not cutthroat, Dartmouth's vibe worked for me - we're all a little competitive, but we all help each other and the competition is more to push everyone forward rather than to tear anyone down. I don't know how I would've made it through chem 5 without the help of some of my friends and fellow premeds. 

I also mentioned that research is really accessible, which is good for any graduate degree. I'm considering pursuing an MD/PhD, so research is especially key for me. 

One of my favourite perks about Darty is that the class size is tiny. At Pitt, all intro level courses are absolutely huge lectures, and the profs never really get to know anyone by name. At Dartmouth, I've certainly had big lecture classes, but 4 of my 6 classes so far have been tiny and I've gotten to know the profs really well. And, even for my bigger classes, professors were super helpful with officer hours and were always willing to make time outside of those hours to give extra help. The profs are genuinely there to teach, not just do research, and it has been a world of difference. You'll always have people that complain about profs, but honestly, I think that for your premed classes, profs will give you as much help as you need to succeed. Classes are still a ton of work, don't get me wrong, but if you have questions and are willing to keep asking and keep working, profs will make sure you understand the material. 

Finally, I don't want to sound like a clout chaser, because I genuinely love Dartmouth as a school and as a community, there are definitely some benefits that you get from attending an Ivy league or other elite institution! This goes for any elite school you got into, not just Darty. It gives you a little bump in applications, and if you decide to study economics in any capacity, you'll get a little help with internships. Ultimately, it wasn't my deciding factor, but it definitely played a role. 

Money was certainly an issue for me, especially because med school is also a huge expense. I wouldn't discount your SUNY school, especially because there are certainly ways that state schools are stronger than ivies - I have a friend who went to Pitt instead of Hopkins, and she is able to graduate in 3 years and double major AND minor AND not have to take a gap year between undergrad and med school because of the flexibility that Pitt offered her with AP credits; that's something that you won't get at Darty (we only let you place out of lower level classes - they won't count towards graduation requirements). In addition, if the SUNY school you got into has a med school you're interested in, you'll be able to make contacts with students and admissions counselors in the school while you're still in undergrad. 

Bottom line: you really can't go wrong. I chose Dartmouth, but do what feels right to you. Feel free to PM with any more questions!",1,,False,flq8olv,False,False,1585383835.0,2020-03-28 03:23:55

Questions about Dartmouth,Fleetfeathers,"Like the other commenter said, Dartmouth runs the gamut. I’m not much of one for “bro-ey” talk, but I honestly appreciate that it’s here and that there is such a wide array of interests and types of people here. Whether you’re into music, drama, gaming, religion, social justice, politics, academics, or anything else, I guarantee Dartmouth has probably at least three clubs dedicated to whatever it is you like. I know we have an orchestra that’s supposedly really good. I think they’re getting ready to play in New York or something? But yeah, we have preppy people, we have jocks, we have nerds, we have artists, we have performers, and above all, we can intermingle with whatever groups we want. Many people party with the frats, but a bunch don’t. 
I don’t know how the science courses compare to other Ivies, but I do know that since Dartmouth is more focused on undergrads than grad students, and it’s not located in a big city, the professors who are here are here because they’re good and they love what they do. I’m sure the rigor matches the other schools, but I feel like Dartmouth does a better job of focusing on undergrads and showing more personalized care.

Looking around.,,"To answer your question, yes I think it's a place you could find comfortable.

I can't speak to the experience as a vet at Dartmouth, or as a man with a family, but from it seems that the vets I know are quite comfortable at Dartmouth. They participate in campus life just like any other undergrad and make friends like any other undergrad. There are people at Dartmouth who are interested in your perspective as well. 

I think Dartmouth is particularly welcoming for veterans, but I'm not familiar with what other schools offer. It is a yellow ribbon school (one of our past presidents, who still teaches classes in the history department, is a veteran and made that a priority during his time as president).

Your username is interesting, the idea of an internship is mind boggling to me. The idea that professionally someone would show up taking care of things and not be financially compensated is absurd.

Looking around.,,"Oh, my dad is from near Carlisle and I've still got a lot of family out that way. Hanover is not really like Carlisle. It might be similar in terms of size and having a college in the town, but Hanover is more upscale. It's a pretty wealthy little town. I don't know what it is about Carlisle that you don't want to return to, but I happen to quite like Hanover. It is a small town, but I think very very few undergrads feel restricted by the size of the town. If you do, it's not too hard to get to Boston or Montreal, both of which are 2-3 hours away driving. But I think most undergrads are simply too busy to really want much more than Hanover has to offer, and I imagine that would be especially true for you, if you're spending time with your family while studying. 

Obviously, I've really liked my experience at Dartmouth and would be happy living in Hanover after graduating. So you might take it with a grain of salt, but if you're considering the school at all. I'd recommend taking a visit if possible. It's really a pretty special place. Most of the professors are extremely friendly, as are the students. I think it's a pretty easy place to like. Is Dartmouth similar to the other schools you're considering?

I actually made this a few years ago (and this is the second or third retread of this username). But yeah, I didn't mind it too much because I was living at home so I didn't really have many expenses, and I got good experience for it. It would be nice if there were an easy solution, but the fact is that most gov't and non-profit organizations don't really have the budget to bring on a lot of paid interns.

The day that early decision results came out, I was kinda sad becuase I had basically chained myself to this school that I wasn't particularly excited about becuase my eyes were set on some other schools. Dartmouth was probably my 4th choice. The more research I did on the school, the more concerned I was. Recently, there has been a few large scandals that have affected the school, and that bothered me. During my first-year trip, I even told some of my trippees that I planed on transferring as soon as possible. I had to persevere through at least one term before I could do that though.

Rain boots that won't split - Wellingtons tend to do pretty well, and LLBean is good too.  Just don't go for something cheap - they'll break within a week or two of use.

Gloves.  So many gloves of all different weights - waterproof/insulated for deep winter or if you decide to take advantage of the ski slopes, medium weight for fall/spring, etc etc

Scarves of all weights.

Long underwear sometimes (I used to wear long underwear pants under my jeans for about 2 months of the year)

Prospective Student - How do you like it?,Murgytroid,"Hey!
I wish I could answer all of your questions succinctly and easily, but I can't. There's obviously much more nuance to college decisions than can be expressed here. I really encourage you to send me a Private message so I can send you my email address, and then we can actually talk, but if you're not up for that I'll try to address your concerns to some degree here! 

Just so you know who I am, I'm a '17 (freshman), who has varied interests, does a lot of random crap on campus, is also somewhat dorky, and really enjoys himself. 

First, in relation to the Philosophy Department:
I haven't actually taken any philosophy classes here, but I have a couple of friends who are majors and they seem to really love it. The great thing about Dartmouth is that, as a liberal arts college, we have the ability to provide an amazing academic experience to students in every department. Also, since we're a liberal arts college, we devote significant attention to humanities departments and value the humanities more than at state schools. Bottom of the line, we're a top school, and if you do reasonably well here (which I'm confident you're more than capable of doing) then you can do what you'd like, especially if you have an early idea of what it is.

In terms of economics, Dartmouth is hugely focused on it. About 15% of each class majors in econ. That's not to say that it's overdone, though. The classes are challenging but the environment isn't hostile. We have an exchange program with Oxford, and we have an Economics-major Rhodes Scholar this year. Bottom line, Dartmouth is very econ-focused, and there are a lot of programs in place that specifically help econ majors and things like that. We really do have an extraordinary econ program.

I also know a whole bunch of people who do debate here. They're mostly pretty dorky in a totally awesome intellectual way and they're really great people. 

Socially, Dartmouth is weird. The partiers all party hard, in the fraternities, 4 nights a week (MWFS). Everyone else busies themselves with all sorts of other awesome things: there's always plenty to do, and in fact, Dartmouth's starting programs to make residential life more centered so that people have even more of a community at home. Themed communities are starting up. It's really exciting.

Long story short about social life, it's always tempting to think: ""It's a Friday night; I should be 'going out' and partying,"" but the more you can avoid succumbing to that feeling the better. There are so many people her who feel the same way, and it's all about finding those people.

I don't know whether you'll get in. If you have a great rec. that's awesome; your SAT score is terrific; your grades should be fine, especially if your high school is good.

Seriously, though, I'd love to talk to you and share my experiences with you. PM me!

And just remember, although choosing a college will eventually determine a lot about your life, there isn't necessarily one choice or another that will make it significantly better. ",6,,False,cgc22h7,False,False,1395801613.0,2014-03-25 21:40:13
Prospective Student - How do you like it?,AerionTargaryen,"I can speak to the PhD placement as I'm three years out now and am currently pursuing a PhD in history at Yale. At Yale and other top research universities professors are stretched so thin between graduate students and research that undergrads are usually left to TAs or simply ignored. It's hard to get the personal attention, research guidance and recommendations that one needs to really get into the top PhD programs. I had a Columbia prof tell me that Columbia ""couldn't give a shit about his teaching as long as he produced top-notch research.""

It's exactly the opposite at Dartmouth. The professors have the same stellar reputations as at the rest of the Ivy Leagues but Dartmouth is unique among its peer institutions in that there are almost no graduate students in the arts and sciences. The professors I had were so bored that they literally begged students to come to office hours, write theses, etc. To be honest, I was a miserable, miserable writer. In four years they got me accepted at the top European history department in the country.

Prospective Student - How do you like it?,DMCer,"Pretty much all Ivies are strong feeders into top grad schools, so if you have a strong record, you'll be in good shape.

Dartmouth is very serious, but yes, the main social scene does revolve around drinking. That is not to say there aren't other activities to pursue; there are a ton, and I know very social people who were never big drinkers. Also, no one drinks around finals and there's never pressure to drink. The students both study hard and play hard. I have more than a few friends who are now at HBS and other top grad programs that drank heavily, but somehow still graduated with only a few grades that weren't As. 

Should you get in and decide to go, I suggest you apply for housing in the East Wheelock dorm cluster.

My high school is pretty good (it's probably one of the upper tier college prep schools in my area - Cleveland, Ohio... it places like 10-15 kids in pretty selective schools - generally a couple to ivies, georgetown, northwestern, chicago, etc. and the other smart kids go to umich or case western. Class is like 500/year, though, with vast majority going to less selective schools, though. It's not like boarding school level of prep, but I might stand a chance in admissions. unfortunately, my college counselor is new to the office and really terrible/didn't send in my transcripts till a month after they were do. I didn't actually get into Ohio State just because my transcripts weren't sent in so my application was never processed, lol. Which didn't end up mattering b/c michigan, but still :/ ).

You could also check out [Market Table](http://www.markettablenh.com/) and [Canoe Club](http://www.canoeclub.us/) which serve good, but more expensive food.

Questions about Dartmouth MEM Program!,chrispyb,"Housing might be kind of a trick, because the easiest way is knowing people there already. Dartmouth does have a website somewhere that has some listings, but the times I've lived off campus have been through knowing people and just being there on campus. Also, now is definitely the time to start looking for places. Actually probably should have started sooner, but obviously couldn't have known. 

The MEM group seems pretty insular when compared with the general undergraduate population, but Thayer sets some good stuff up at the beginning of the year to introduce people to each other, including a fun overnight trip to the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge. Clubs on campus that would probably be best to look at having some fun with would probably be all through the DOC (Dartmouth Outdoors Club), such as Cabin and Trail (the hiking / camping club), Ledyard Canoe Club (they are all the Kayakers) and DMC (the climbing club).

Thayer has some of it's own stuff as well. Every Friday at 5 there's free beer for grad students and staff. The Dartmouth Formula Racing Team is always looking for people as well.

Also, looking at what some of my friends are up to, it looks like they occasionally rent cabins from the school for overnights and stuff. There's a ton of cabins available, you just have to book some of them kind of early. 

Any other questions? Also I might be able to message you some of my friends emails who will be in the program next year to see if they know anything about housing. ",1,,False,c42942s,False,False,1332075838.0,2012-03-18 08:03:58

Dartmouth,gga2cthrowaway,"Im going to paste a comment I made on here from another post, but it should answer your question somewhat lol.

“Hey, ‘24 here!

From talking to a bunch of students from all of the admit GroupMes and facebook groups, I just clicked with the 24s at Dartmouth the most. Everyone just seemed a lot more friendly, less pretentious, welcoming, and funny. 

As other commenters have been pointing out, the collaborativeness of the current student body and the upperclassmen was something that took me away; many current students had DMed and talked to me on occasion and gave me a lot of honest advise. I tried to reach out to the upperclassmen at the other universities I got into and although they did help in answering my questions, the conversations just felt different: not as eager and rather superficial (basically like how the 2024 admit group chats felt from their colleges).

The amount of undergraduate attention and class sizes was another big thing that drew me in. As a hopeful pre-med, I don’t want to be in lecture halls full of hundreds of students gunning for that A. 

The location was something I was very weary about at first. I am an outdoorsy person but I had never lived outside of a major metropolitan area. I was fearful of being in the “middle of no where.” However, I quickly realized that students dont really feel that they’re in the middle of no where when they’re on campus. Theres always something going on, and I feel like living in Hanover is kind of a once in a life time opportunity. 

That kinda segways into my other point of social life. Everyone tags Dartmouth with being a fratty school that drinks a lot. This kind of results in people to have very skewed perceptions of the social life at Dartmouth. [Like my parents](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g9bfuy/family_giving_me_so_much_sht_for_committing_to_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), they fail to realize how uniquely inclusive it is. Moreover, people won’t really judge you for not drinking, and I know a couple people that are affiliated and don’t even drink. 

All in all, I feel that I will be much happier at Dartmouth. A good rule of thumb that my counselor had told me in picking a college is to pick one that you already see yourself liking and enjoying, rather than picking one and making yourself *potentially* like it down the road. 

Other colleges that I was accepted to and was considering were Princeton, Duke, Vanderbilt, Brown, Northwestern, JHU, and UChicago.

Dartmouth,seatto2023,"First, Dartmouth has many different types of people with many different interests. This is just one person's take and others will find the same positives as negatives.

The following is edited from another post.

It’s isolated off in the woods. That was a big positive for me. I hate cities (the incessant noise, the concrete, the cars, so many people, etc, etc). I love, love being surrounded by nature. I love little towns too.

Nature and outdoors stuff is so awesome. Outing Club is huge. So many activities every week. And so many fun subclubs. The Outing Club so great socially for me; I can just message the various groups and found hiking & climbing partners and places to live around the country.

The quarter system is like drinking from a firehose. I love it. So fast changing every day. Many classes (ok not all) were fantastic and profs really interesting. I mean yeah definitely got stressed out and miserable at times, but so does my sister and she's on semesters.

Undergrads have 100% of the colleges attention and resources. That's real. Lots of money for research and creative ideas. It was easy for me to get research job on campus and that led to a summer job for me.

I don't personally find the social options limited, but I found a close group in the cabin & trail and other subclubs and formed tight bonds with my LLC (like an academic theme house for non-Dart people). I don't have enough time to partake of all the social options that I'd like. I didn't go to the frats that often last year as my free time is taken up with clubs and sports. I guess I went like once a week to a frat party (if I wasn't swamped with my classes). Usually on a round, like dorm gathering, frat party for some pong, then DOC gathering, that kind of thing. My friend group is not into getting shit-faced though many drink moderately.

You can get to the Boston easy enough. I went to Boston and NYC during frosh year and I think I'm done with that for awhile. Too much other stuff to do IMO.

Liberal Arts College. I wanted that and not a technical focused school. Wanted/want to combine STEM with strong side focus on government/poly sci.

The big party weekends each quarter are awesome. So much fun.

D-plan give you so much flexibility. Everyones path is different.

Negatives:  Many of the above will be negatives depending on your interest. Dartmouth is a medium-sized liberal arts college. That is going to be a big negative if you don't want a liberal arts college.",2,,False,g1vbqzq,False,False,1597677970.0,2020-08-17 10:26:10

Dartmouth transfer questions,MArtswad,"Hi! I transferred in last year and would be happy to answer any questions you have.

Some general things:

You stand out through personality and life experiences. Most of the applicants will have near perfect grades. The essays are your best friend. Don't do the thing of being overly formal, braggy, or just list things that make you a good student. Talk about things that have genuinely impacted you as a person.

In questions that will inevitably come up that ask ""Why Dartmouth?"" Don't just give vague answers-- make it clear it's your best choice. You want to sound like you want Dartmouth, not just a better school.

Last year, there were 8 transfers, 5 of them veterans. The past five years have all had single digit transfers. This year there is almost 40. Why? Because the number of transfers Dartmouth takes in depends on the number of freshmen it has already taken in. Applications are at an all time low because of the pandemic. This will probably be lower next year than this year, but I bet your chances are still higher than usual.

What are the senior engineering projects like at Dartmouth? How do they compare with CU Boulder?,EWheelock,"I saw your previous question and didn't get around to answering.  I think that of your other choices, CU Boulder is definitely the top choice.  Both Dartmouth the CU Boulder have some engineering faculty who are true leaders in their fields and have excellent students and engineering programs.  I don't know Mines very well but my impression is that Virginia Tech is a bit of a quantity over quality kind of school: they run lots of students through both UG and grad and publish lots of papers, but the quality isn't a consistent priority.

It's really hard to compare the senior projects: both Dartmouth and Boulder have students working with industry to do projects that have real applications.  Both include some very impressive work, and some more average work.

I think it comes down to this: Dartmouth is more personalized and gives you more opportunities outside of engineering.  I suspect it also has more hands-on work, although I'm not sure.  Boulder has a larger faculty and so has expertise across the board rather than in particular areas like at Dartmouth.    

Maybe the ideal is to go to Dartmouth as an undergrad and then get a masters or PhD at Boulder or MIT, when you approach running out of advanced courses of interest at Dartmouth, or if you have a particular area of interest and can identify the top expert in the field and go work in that lab.  That trajectory is not uncommon--more often at MIT than at Boulder, perhaps since it's nearby.",1,,False,fv47q8k,False,False,1592397447.0,2020-06-17 07:37:27

A frat that appeals to more people is going to have more rushies.

In my opinion, you should honestly be fine. If you’re the type of person who would be accepted into a given fraternity at Dartmouth, I highly doubt that losing out on that freshman year would be the game changer.

Research at Dartmouth,Bicoidprime,"Cerenkov imaging in radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is used to treat cancer tumors by killing the tissue with high ionizing radiation doses. Until recently it has not been possible to image the radiation dose delivered to tissue, but through Cherenkov light imaging, this delivered dose can be mapped with high resolution cameras. The research group focuses on quantification of the imaging, and developing tools which allow radiation therapy to be delivered in a safer and more validated manner.

Only thing is you gotta make sure you attend each session (you can only miss up to two, I think), so check your schedule beforehand since they happen in the middle of the day, around the afternoon side.

Another class I took was the jiu jitsu self defense class which was also pretty chill. It was in the evening and cost some $$, but was run by non-Dartmouth people so the attendance was super chill.

Dartmouth Interview GONE WRONG?!,rose_all_day_,"As someone who does alumni interviews, I typically get assigned my candidates and then when the interview happens is based on my ability to schedule it. I’ve also only had three students I’ve interviewed ever get in— I’m in a major city with a competitive applicant pool. As an interviewer, I will leave the interview with a sense of whether I liked the kid or not, and can usually tell if they have no shot, but otherwise I don’t really have a sense if they’re likely to get in, because Dartmouth just gets so many competitive applicants.  There was only one kid I’ve interviewed who I knew would 100% make it (legacy, top grades at a top school, spoke a bunch of languages and stuff), and only one applicant who I would have been truly crushed to see not get in (he got in). I know my alumni association tries to interview everyone, but we have a ton of alums in the area so that’s pretty doable. We don’t get a ton of guidance in terms of how to conduct the interview and every one always goes a little differently, so if this interview felt different than your other ones, it’s probably just because that is how this particular interviewer does things. 

I will also say that when I was a high school student, I had a great Harvard interview. Got a call the night before, interviewer said the deadline was that week and he’d been told to do whatever it took to make sure I got interviewed before that deadline so he was coming to my high school to meet me.

Dartmouth Interview GONE WRONG?!,SamsterHamster55,"Okay so we know from the Harvard documents that getting an interview late from Harvard is a very good sign.

So maybe that's true of Dartmouth too?

Or maybe it's not. Dartmouth is a lot more generous with interviews then most other schools so maybe getting one even this late is meaningless. Maybe your alumni just forgot today contact you. It certainly sounds like you interviewer was busy and (maybe) a little disorganized. Maybe you are a ""throw them a bone"" candidate like you said.

Point is, nobody really knows and everybody (except for like a former AO or something) is just as clueless as you. Interviews are assigned late for a myriad of reasons and it's impossible to pinpoint a signal in all the noise.

That being said, I haven't heard of many Dartmouth applicants getting a phone call, and it sounds like even though there were no alumni in the area admissions made a very intentional effort to hook you up with one. That in conjunction with the fact that your interview was so late could mean that the admissions office needed to hear what an interviewer had to say about you (which would be a good sign). But also Dartmouth is known to place little value on alumni interviews so it seems strange that one would be so important to making their decision.  Who knows what they're thinking?

You also mentioned that your interviewer had to leave the interview because they were busy and that they arrived late. This means that you were not interviewing at an optimal time for them, which likely means that they needed to scramble to find snippet of time to interview you ASAP. I don't know exactly how you guys set up a time, but if you interviewer recommended this specific time it could mean a couple of things, 

1. You could have been assigned as a high priority interviewee. We saw on the Harvard documents that they assign each interviewee  on a scale of 1-5 (I think it's 5? Whatever it doesn't matter). For interviewees assigned a 1 they specifically say that they need the applicant interviewed ASAP. Perhaps Dartmouth has a similar ranking system and perhaps you were assigned a 1?

Or 2. The rushed interview just means that the interview report deadline is coming up and you interviewer has been procrastinating interviewing you. They just needed to scramble to get your report in before the general deadline. Based on what you the impression I have of your interviewer from your post this seems pretty likely.

TLDR - Who knows what it means? It might be good, it might be bad, it might be meaningless.

I hope this post was (semi) coherant. I'm a fellow Dartmouth applicant as well. Maybe if all goes well I'll see you campus next year :) Good luck!

Edit: Oh also write them a thank you note ASAP! Mentioning any information you forgot to tell them is great, as is reiterating that Dartmouth is your first choice (as long as you backed that up by knowing a lot about the school). Bonus points if you can mention something from your conversation!

HS Senior has Questions!,biggreen10,"1) I applied ED, so I didn't get into any others, I do not regret it at all

2) My dad went to Dartmouth, so I was pretty aware of the culture before I got here, so I'm not coming up with much for this one. I guess I'd have to say that I was surprised by the opportunity to try new things. I became very involved in student government which was never on my radar and my brother-in-law took up whitewater kayaking which has since taken him all across the Americas.

3) Right sized student body, great location, professors committed to UG teaching, overall community

4) Decent to good. I liked the setup more when I was here, but I still eat on campus a day or two a week for lunch.

5) Good. Econ is the most popular major by a mile, and math is one of the more popular science majors. I enjoyed the ECON courses I took, and my math professor was good

6)  For some it is too small, too white, too remote, etc. It's all about taste. I think the administration could do a better being a bit less reactive, and they need to drop this talk of expanding the student body

7) I loved Williams, I was really torn between Dartmouth, Williams, and Yale for ED. Didn't look at Northwestern. I've had friends go there for business and law school, but no undergrad.

8) Like any college campus, I'd wager. There also weren't dating apps when I was here, so I'm not really sure how that has changed things on campus.

9) There will be a big registered party at some fraternity or sorority pretty much every weekend, but even if there isn't a party, people will still be hanging out in the basement playing pong. Fraternity parties at Dartmouth are open to the whole student body and must be free to attend.

10) It's possible to get a single as a first year, most don't have them, but they are out there. Sophomores probably don't get many singles, as they get last pick in the housing draw and singles go pretty quickly. Overall, I like all the rooms I had (a 2-room double, two 2-room triples, and then two singles).

I'd say keep your mind open on the Greek scene, as many high schoolers don't really understand it, and Dartmouth's works very differently than most other places. If you want to keep beatboxing you should check out some of the a capella groups! They often need skilled beatboxers.

HS Senior has Questions!,Dstudent19,"Created a throwaway because I don't want to link my main account to my school. I'm a 19 (Junior) at Dartmouth. Also, I know that my positive experience does not speak for everyone here. Most people are very happy here, but a few are not, and I'm not trying to delegitimize their experiences. 

1) I turned down Penn, Georgetown, and UVA. I was denied at Harvard (after waitlist), Princeton, and Yale (to which I had applied EA and had been deferred). Choosing Dartmouth was the best decision of my life, and if I had to do things over I'd just apply ED here. I chose Dartmouth because of its small size and academic excellence, especially in undergraduate teaching. 


2) It's hard for me to remember what I was expecting when I decided to come here, but I'll try my best. I was surprised at how quickly this place felt like home for me. I was expecting the process to take a few terms, but I felt comfortable here within the first week. I was also surprised at how accessible the social life/greek life is here, given my impressions of other schools. I was also very surprised at the level of participation by the student body in school traditions - Homecoming, Green Key, various ""challenges"" (Ledyard, Lou's, etc.). I think the thing that surprised me most is the institutional memory of the student body - I feel like I've heard more stories of legendary students from the past and history of the college than I might've at other places.

3) I think that Dartmouth is the best place to go to college in the country, based off of my conversations with friends at other places and my own experience here. The best thing about Dartmouth is the social scene. Greek life is extraordinarily open and there is basically universal access to parties among the student body. In addition, the clubs and student interest groups have a strong focus on providing social outlets (formals, semis, socials) for their members. As a freshman, you have a number of opportunities to get to know people outside of your floor, and I was friends with a number of upperclassmen by the end of my first term. Academically, I am a huge fan of the quarter system. Classes are intense, but you do not have to focus on too many things at one time and it makes things easier to manage. You also have huge opportunities to meet and become friendly with professors. I have never been taught by a TA or grad student, and I have done research with or work for two professors here - the experience has been absolutely invaluable to me.


I'd like to talk about the frats for a little bit, since I know that's the huge elephant in the room. I am a huge fan of Greek Life, though it's not without its problems. Some frats, for instance, have problems with sexual assault. Like all things, though, this varies greatly among the frats - others are known for being safe or welcoming or tolerant etc. I think Greek Life is so great here in part because it is so pervasive. At some schools, there is simply not enough space for the majority of students to be in greek life, and so frats become exclusive and barriers to entry. At Dartmouth, most students are involved in Greek life in some way, and among those who are not many are not involved by their own choice (although this is not always the case - especially not for women, the sorority system has its own problems). Each house has a specific identity. For some houses (maybe 3 or so out of 13), this identity is entirely or almost entirely based on the varsity teams from which they draw new members. For the others, the identity is self-selecting and persistent - students have a year to figure out where they are comfortable, and generally join frats where they fit in. There are eclectic frats, co-ed houses, ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" frats, ""smart"" frats, etc. It's impossible to talk about this without descending into stereotypes, but my point is that there is enough of a diversity that most people actually find a frat that feels like home, and that in principle there is a home for almost everyone on campus, including natural introverts. The other cool thing is that most houses, including the ones which are not typically seen as the best on campus, have at least one major event which a ton of people on campus go to, so there is a flexible distribution of social events among the houses. And just about every house has the resources to plan and conduct social events and to have an open basement most nights. Frats and sororities also typically host A Cappella, dance, rap, and comedy performances every term. 


Most of my unaffiliated friends have found great communities in other student groups, and still make use of the frats as social spaces during on nights. I am affiliated, and it has been a extraordinary experience.


4) The food is good. Foco, which is the all-you-can-eat food court, has typically great food, although it varies and there are some bad days. The Hop just changed for the worse, but the food is still good. I don't do Collis that much, but it's also a popular option. The only negative about eating here is not the quality of the food itself, but the fact that the meal plans are pretty limiting and there are less dining options than at other, larger schools. Off-campus dining is much better than you'd expect from a school this size, though, so that's a plus. Generally multiple great options for eating out, whether you're looking for something quick or a fancier sit down dinner. 


5) You'll be fine. A bunch of friends of mine are Econ majors, and they're doing just fine without holing up and working 24/7. 


6) Students work out here more often than at other places, in my judgment, but generally I'd say the biggest problem is that students (including myself) live unhealthy lifestyles. Lots of drinking and a good amount of all-nighters. The work-hard play-hard lifestyle is definitely what prevails here. I love it, but you might not. Like at every college, there are problems with sexual assault/violence. Recent reforms have helped this, but it's never going away. Political conflict on campus used to be a problem, along with the sense among the frats that they were under the gun, but it has been an extraordinarily calm year - I'm not sure if this is a problem any more. Things seem to have really quieted down since the Lohse/Freedom Budget days, and the detente has allowed student life to thrive. 


7) Don't know enough about Williams or Northwestern to make the comparison. 


8) A lot of people will tell you that dating is dead here but that's not really true. Some students participate in ""hook-up culture"" - going to frat parties looking for a one-night partner, others find more permanent relationships. Dartmouth is a very social place, and the dating scene is what you make of it. 


9) They're great. Most of Dartmouth's parties are open to all students on campus, and the on nights are Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Monday to a lesser degree. Frats will typically be open to all of campus if they are open on a night, and they will typically be open WFS except if there is an event - formal, semi, etc. There are also big parties every term which are special, but are also open to all students. Pop-punk, Pigstick, highlighter, etc occur semi regularly. There is also one big weekend every term - in order, Homecoming, Winter Carnival, and Green Key. These also feature big parties open to all students. Parties typically center on frat basements, where students play Dartmouth pong. Dartmouth pong is a competitive drinking game with 2-4 (typically 4) players. Players use ping-pong paddles with the handles broken off (grasping around the paddle itself) and play what looks like a game of ping-pong with two clusters of cups of beer or water arranged on each side. If one person hits a cup on the opposite side, the other team drinks a half; if one person sinks a cup on the opposite side, the other team drinks a full. It's very fun, and a frat basement on a typical on night has 3-5 pong tables with games ongoing, music playing over speakers, and other students drinking and talking around the ongoing games waiting their turn. There are a lot more rules of pong and permutations of the game but it's too much to describe in text.


10) Housing options are pretty limited as a freshman, and you will almost certainly (or certainly, not sure which) have one or two roommates. I loved my roommates, and am still friends with both. As you become an upperclassman, you will be able to live in a single or in a fraternity (or both). Most students live on campus. ",2,,False,dnuy0zb,False,False,1507056308.0,2017-10-03 13:45:08

HS Senior has Questions!,Dstudent19,"I hope this helps. I definitely did not consider myself an extrovert when I came here, but this place has been really extraordinary and I feel like it has had a permanent and lasting positive impact on my life. You'll hear people here say jokingly that Dartmouth is a cult, and the sense of that is really accurate. Most students (though again, not all) will speak so glowingly of the place that it might seem disingenuous. It's not. Dartmouth just succeeds in generating meaningful communities in a way that wasn't true of my high school and I know isn't really true of the schools my high school friends are at (Northeastern and UPenn, among others). 


I have a couple other thoughts that don't fit into your questions. People say that Dartmouth is the most conservative Ivy. That's debatable. It might be the most conservative politically, but it usually doesn't feel that way. In my experience, most conservative students are not politically active on campus and generally the campus has become less and less politicized over the last 2 years (even with Trump being elected, which is surprising). But Dartmouth is extraordinarily *institutionally* conservative. Students are, generally, very concerned with preserving and handing down Dartmouth culture - this tendency is seen in bequests which students typically make when they graduate and also in the high participation of the student body in various school traditions. Alumni involvement and loyalty is sky-high, too. I think we're ranked 2nd in the country for alumni donations, and right now we're in a historic drought because the alumni hate the current president. So there's a sort of natural conservatism in the student body and among alumni, but this is not so much manifested politically. Also, there are a large amount of prep/boarding school kids here, and there is a sense that socioeconomic diversity is not so great. This is definitely a problem, but every year the houses get more socioeconomically diverse. I cannot speak for everyone, especially since I went to prep school, but the economic exclusivity is not structural but cultural, and it is not present in most houses or student groups. I also strongly believe that the problem is helped by the accessibility of social spaces, and would be worse if the social life were, like at other places, based on carving out spaces where other students are excluded. For context, this place has far more socioeconomic diversity than my high school, which also considered it a priority. Finally, you should be wary of any ""official"" Dartmouth College account of student life. The administration tries to deemphasize the Greek System in its marketing, rather than embracing it as a positive feature of campus life. This, I think, is because the image of Greek Life at other schools is impossible to overcome in the minds of prospective students except if a prospie takes the time to get to know the place. To that end, if you visit you should take the official tour, go to official programs, etc, but you should also try to get an unvarnished view of the place from current students and get a taste of the social life and academics if possible. Reach out to any current students you have a connection with and ask them to give you a feel for the school. Also remember that not all students have the same experiences, and the best way to figure out how you'll like the place is to find someone similar to you who is here. 


Also, I agree with the other poster about A Cappella - the groups are always looking for beatboxers. If you can sing, make sure to try out your freshman fall. A Cappella, rap, dance, comedy, and other student groups are also great ways to meet upperclassmen your freshman year and make immediate, permanent close friends. There are groups for nearly every interest.

HS Senior has Questions!,Dstudent19,"The campus is small and feels smaller. The dorms are splayed out roughly evenly surrounding the Green, which is the center of student life. The centers of activity, too - library, classrooms, gym, frats - are distributed in such a way that you always have to cross the green in everyday life, so the student body is constantly interacting and there is never really a feeling of being isolated on one part of campus. Never felt like I needed a bike. Walking from the farthest end of campus to the opposite farthest end is at most 15 minutes, and I've never had to make that walk - expect a typical walk of 5-7 minutes or less. 

The Dartmouth Outing Club is the most popular non-greek activity on campus. Dartmouth College owns extensive land up north which has hiking trails, canoeing locations, and ski slopes. They do regular hikes, including ""The Fifty,"" which is a fifty mile, 24 or so hour hike that a good portion (although definitely a minority) of the student body participates in. If you decide to go to Dartmouth, your first experience here will be a First-Year Trip sponsored by the DOC in which two upperclassmen will take you and a number of other freshmen on a outdoor trip of your choice for I think four or five days - hiking, canoeing, mountain climbing, etc. Lots of people do DOC events, and it's a great club for people who love hiking or spending time outdoors. For about 60% of the year it is too cold for outdoor BBQs. When it isn't, the school itself has a couple of them. Frats, too, sometimes host open BBQs on frat row. It'd be hard for student groups to do this given the difficulty of obtaining cooking facilities.


Many students here don't drink. There are a few students in my frat who don't drink because of athletic reasons. There is definitely a pervasive drinking culture, but you absolutely do not have to drink to be fully socially active here or to have a good time. None of the student groups are centered around drinking.

Friends of mine who are in Greek houses have spoken positively of its continuity, which helps with the D-plan's fragmentation. I've also heard negative experiences, especially around the rush experience for sororities, and the pledge term for fraternities. This is also an area in which Dartmouth is actively changing. The house system is just starting up, with one of its explicit goals being to promote continuity in students' experience.

The areas I can better speak to is the DOC (Dartmouth Outing Club). It is composed of subclubs, each of which has its own culture, but in general their culture is one of acceptance.

The ability to learn from and observe within this environment is a very real opportunity and I'd suggest sticking with it if you can. Of bigreen10's comments, I have found the instant credibility thing can really be useful too- I have found myself kinda instant-elevated in various social or community groups or initiatives once people know I went to Dartmouth (but please dear god let them figure that out themselves, they will, and you don't need to force it).

The process is like shopping for fruit. You go to the market knowing you want 5 apples, a bunch of bananas, one pineapple, and a grapefruit for this crazy fruit salad recipe your mom had. You get there and there are 75 apples. Some of the ones on top are bruised so you dig a little, find some you're happy with an move on. The best apples?

Back then it used to be the well rounded students. Varsity athlete, who was also on school government, near the top of the class and maybe played a musical instrument. 

Now he says they want people with standout individual passions. Not do alls, but people who do one thing very well. Not just a varsity athlete, but team captain, state champion, all state team. Musician who competes at a high level, is the top chair in their youth ensemble. The charity worker who founded the first soup kitchen in their side of town. Makes sense too. If you get nothing but well rounded people, you just get a very boring and similar student body. 

Edit: all these students have straight or near straight As, and take a demanding course load for their school. He's seen kids who went to Dartmouth who only had one AP, but there was only one AP offered at that school.

Tips For Being Accepted?,MultiGeometry,"I will say this. Dartmouth students are adventurous and open to a variety of new experiences and ideas. There are a number of colleges you'll be a great fit for. Find them, and don't write them off. It's great to have a first choice, but your personal ambition is the most important thing to your happiness and future success, not Dartmouth vs. [enter school name here].

Dartmouth is a very active, athletic school. 25% of students compete on one of the intercollegiate teams in their time here. A lot of other students are involved in club sports, intramurals, or there own personal endeavors. There's also the Dartmouth Outing Club. Backcountry skiing and lumberjacking are not among our official intercollegiate teams, but these communities are very vibrant. It's also a walking campus. All these factors create what has always appeared to me, as the healthiest population of people in one place I have ever seen.

DO be passionate about something. High school can be tough because everyone wants to fit in. Whatever. You'll learn how close minded that is. I was a top recruit for my sport (athletes are shoe ins for Early Decision) but I also did Math team, not to bump my resume, but because I had fun on those trips. I only ever scored 1 point. I wasn't very electable, but junior year I helped out Student Council with events because I enjoyed that. My reputation of being dependable and creative earned (I lost my election) me a spot on student council as Fifth Member (selected by the elected members). If I did these things and DIDN'T get in to my top choice, they are valuable experience I still hold dear. If you do these and you DO get in to your top choice, guess what, you go to your top choice school and DON'T regret the time you spent on 'fluffer' activities.


High School can be busy, but basically you need the grades, you need the GPA and you need the extra curriculars. Beyond that there's no equation to success unless your father donated a building.

""Dear future MALS student,

I'm currently in the program, however I've only taken one class so far, so my knowledge is somewhat limited.

The program is very flexible. You can do one of the traditional ""tracks"" but you can also just do the ""general track"" which allows you to focus on whatever may interest you. In my one class, ""fiction writing – the novella,"" I learned a ton. In addition to what I learned from the professor, sharing my work with the other students who ranged in ages from early 20's to late 40's provided a varied perspective and interesting insight that greatly added to the class. I'm looking forward to doing two independent studies as well as taking undergraduate classes that interest me. It is this flexibility that I think makes the MALS program unique.

I don't know about the value of the degree, as I'm participating in the program because I'm interested in learning in a structured environment. I graduated from college fourteen years ago, so this has been a welcome challenge and a unique change of pace.

I look forward to meeting you when you start the program.

I actually can't say that I know; I guess I just always assumed that there existed a straight (though not well-known) arch major. When I visited the campus and asked my brother about architecture at Dartmouth, he explained that, as far as he knew, there was an architecture major, but that it was basically composed of 50% engineering courses and 50% studio art courses (with a few true architecture classes thrown in).

Great advice, appreciate it   

>I wouldn't worry about majoring in a specialty or not   

I think you're right. In fact, I'd rather go to Dartmouth and study architecture than to Rice or Cornell (which both have very prestigious pre-professional architecture programs), because I'm not sure that I want to be an architect. I am, however, sure that I want to go to Dartmouth, and I'm sure that I want to give architecture (and many other areas of study) a shot, so Dartmouth's relatively loose program, [as detailed in this article](http://thedartmouth.com/2008/02/01/mirror/architecture), seems ideal to me.

Any other Dartmouth hopefuls?,LostMind,"No problem man. English is great here. There are a few amazing classes. If you like the technical side of language (linguistics and such) I would take the ENGL/LING class History of the English Language. You basically learn Old English, Middle English, and Early Modern English all in one term (so it is REALLY intense, but totally doable). 

Ok, so I looked up the Architecture thing, because I was kind of curious, and it looks like there is no official Architecture major. That should NOT discourage you. 
You need to take a look [here](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~architecture/courses.htm). - if you haven't all ready - and [here](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~reg/courses/desc2010/) as well. Go down to the Studio art section and compare the courses with the requirements. 

Basically, it appears that you would want to be a SART major taking as many architecture, architecture related- art history and architecture related-engineering classes as possible, allowing you an unofficial concentration (though there is an OFFICIAL concentration of an arch. minor... so maybe this would be an official major concentration??). 

I could be wrong though... maybe there is an official architecture major through engineering? Either way, these web pages will allow you to see specifically what your course options are to make sure you understand exactly what the program would be like. 

Like you said, there is NO problem with going to Dartmouth and studying architecture, whether it is known for its pre-professional architecture program or not. The firs page I cited talks about how a ton of Dartmouth grads - who follow a pre-architecture path as close as possible - go on to some awesome schools for architecture graduate programs. 

Hope all this makes sense - not trying to discourage or encourage, just want to make sure you have all the info to make an informed decision. 

Let me know if you have any other questions. 

EDIT: ALSO, I bet the class on the Bauhaus is BALLER. I really wish I could have taken that. I learned a little about the Bauhaus through a random ""college course"" designated class, but I bet this class is with Marlene Heck (who lectured for the class I did take) and that would be freaking awesome.

My concern is this: if you are studying remotely (or off this term), not living in NH, and hold your permanent residence out of state (such as your parents' house), voting in the NH election may be voter fraud. You need to be able to claim domicile in NH. If you are enrolled and studying remotely out of state, I do NOT think that passes the legal definition of domicile. 

If I am wrong on this, it'd be good to have the supporting information posted here (and the sticky page on the subreddit). If this is a close election, and the legal battle is already being prepared, college student ballots are going to be under a lot of scrutiny. The college has worked with the poll workers in the past to help verify domicile based on dorm assignments. If you're requesting an absentee ballot based on an old address that Dartmouth cannot support you living at, there is a strong argument to have that ballot thrown out, and could open the door to legal penalties as well.

""With the College's longstanding commitment to meet 100 percent of students' demonstrated financial need for all four years, the College announced a goal of expanding the income threshold for a full-tuition scholarship from $100,000 to $125,000; eliminate loans from all financial aid awards; and become one of only six colleges and universities in the United States to guarantee need-blind admissions to non-U.S. citizens.""
