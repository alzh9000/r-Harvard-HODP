you112233,"I summarized their summary with most of the bits that affect students but I would still encourage you to read the report:

**Health Monitoring**

-	Daily check in (maybe live at https://dailycheck.cornell.edu/) for COVID symptoms.
-	Possibly require flu vaccine
-	Face masks policy live: https://ehs.cornell.edu/campus-health-safety/occupational-health/covid-19/face-covering-and-mask-requirements
-	Contact tracing recommended via phone app

**Testing**

-	Low threshold for testing including those in contact with Covid-positive cases
-	“Surveillance Testing” regularly testing students and staff
-	Test students before they travel to Ithaca (remotely) and when they arrive
-	Testing students already in Ithaca and during move-in. Move-in may be 4 or 8 days to accommodate
-	Reactivation of key card and NetID requires completing a checklist

**Quarantine/Isolation/Contact Tracing**

-	Quarantine at permanent residence or Ithaca hotels, including possibly the Statler
-	“Students should be provided immunity from university disciplinary violations for activities they disclose during contact tracing”

**Modifications to Academic Activities**

-	Later start to the school year, no breaks
-	2 modes of instruction: all online, and in-person with remote access
-	Classroom capacity reduced to 13-24%
-	Wear masks in classroom, sit in assigned seats (bruh)
-	Virtual OH encouraged
-	Barton Hall or other large spaces repurposed as quiet study spaces to limit gatherings elsewhere
-	Regular grading reinstated
-	Attendance shouldn’t be counted for credit but should be taken to facilitate contact tracing
-	Recommend a stricter cap to 18 credit hours for mental health
-	Orientation should focus on behavioral expectations

**Modifications to student life**

-	Student Organizations encouraged to do virtual activities, among other considerations
-	Greek Life: “The university should develop an addendum
to the Risk Management and Social Events
Policy that requires compliance with NYS
and local public health guidelines; wearing
masks when there are visitors in the house;
registration of public health monitors for
events; coordination with SCL to ensure
vendors are healthy and safe; and
registering the addresses of chapter
annexes.”
    - “Some advocated for strict enforcement with
strong sanctions, while others caution against
risks of pushing activities “underground” where
they may be more difficult to enforce.
Greek leaders expressed desire to be involved in
enforcement of behavioral expectations and
maintain close partnership with university
leadership. “
-	“The university should suspend in-person
concerts and lectures that involve outside
guests and promote innovative approaches
to entirely new ways of socializing while
distancing.”

**Housing**

-	Eliminate quads and triples.
-	Rooms assigned to bathrooms to reduce # of people sharing
-	Lounges and kitchens remain open
-	Dining halls provide to-go service, tables properly spaced, cutlery disposable, reservations required for dine-in

**De-densification**

-	“Campus can be de-densified by inviting only
some or none of students back for
residential instruction. If this option is
pursued, the following student groups
should be given priority: new students,
including transfer students; residential
advisors; graduating seniors (especially in
the spring); athletes (if competition will take
place for their sport); and students who would not otherwise be able to maintain
academic progress without access to
campus such as students in programs that
require hands-on access to special facilities
and those who lack access to internet or
quiet learning spaces at home”
    - Comments on this suggest it is not ideal. That is to say, they are proposing this as an option but NOT saying it is what should be done. In fact, the committee recommends AGAINST doing this. 

**”Campaign for Public Health and Behavioral Influence Strategies”**

-	“Recommend a system of progressive
sanctions. Initial response would involve
just the student and be educational.
Subsequent violations would involve
parent/legal guardian, if the student has
signed a FERPA waiver. Students could lose
access to university facilities and ultimately
be referred to the Office of the Judicial
Administrator for repeated violations that
necessitate formal discipline or removal
from enrollment”",An actual summary of the 97 page report,878,0.99,hdvn9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/hdvn9a/an_actual_summary_of_the_97_page_report/,72,1592872470.0,2020-06-22 19:34:30
loool1143,"Forget about classes moving online, forget about the in-person semester being over for everyone, forget about the vital research this university conducts being put on hold, forget about students being forced to return to shitty home environments, even forget about at-risk people dying.  These are things we talk about all the time and if it’s somehow not enough to keep you out of a fucking annex, then please consider the people who rely on Cornell for employment.

Because the fact of the matter is, a few more events by “unnamed parties” gone wrong, and literally hundreds if not thousands of people here are unemployed OVERNIGHT.  Yes UNEMPLOYED.  Without jobs, without a stream of income, a.k.a. something necessary to feed, clothe, and house oneself when one’s parents do not do so.  The people who work in the dining halls to serve you the food you eat every day, the people who clean the classroom floors where you thoughtlessly dump your Canada goose jackets (yes I’ve seen kids just throw them on the ground), the people who clean the dorm bathrooms for you, the people who do maintenance around campus.  All those people will be without jobs, at least until February, perhaps much longer if Cornell has to permanently lay people off to cover for the money they are hemorrhaging.

And it’s not just Cornell employees, its the countless small business owners, many of whom are immigrants without a backup plan, who have been staying open by the skin of their teeth betting on this semester’s success.  It’s the uber and Lyft drivers who ferry you around town, and it’s the families of all these people.

I’m not sure if any of you have ever taken the opportunity to *really* look around during your time here, but Ithaca, New York is not a hotbed of economic opportunity by any stretch of the imagination.  There aren’t a lot of entry-level jobs floating around for these people to turn to if things go south, especially not this year.  If these people lose their income, because of you, yes YOU, there are a lot of fucking consequences.  Some of them might lose their homes, their cars, their savings.  Some might not have savings.  If they have kids, those kids might now *eat* less because of YOU.  Those kids might not get Christmas presents this year because of YOU.  Those kids might now helplessly watch their parents suffer from depression because of YOU.  Newsflash, unemployment takes a toll on the mental health Cornell students love to bitch about a hell of a lot more than prelims (see this helpful link [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coping-with-unemployment/art-20485976](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coping-with-unemployment/art-20485976)).

I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but a lot of our dining hall employees are not young people, and if they lose these jobs, not only will their retirement saving stop, but they may need to dip into those savings to support themselves, delaying their retirement indefinitely because YOU couldn’t follow the rules.  These people are a part of our community just as much as any student is. I’ll fucking die on that hill.  Most of them will be here or have been here longer than any of us, and they will be working here after we’re gone.  They are definitely more so a part of Cornell than certain unnamed fucking frosh who have already busted in here like they own the place.

You interact with them on a daily basis, you recognize them, they make everything run, they work incredibly hard, they smile and give you words of encouragement and fucking feed you.  If the campus shuts down, they do not go back to Westchester or Long Island or Miami or Manhattan.  You are indebted to them, you owe it to them to do everything you can to keep this semester alive.

What is a bummer of a semester for you, has potentially ENORMOUS implications for the lives of our staff here, and the college town community as a whole.  How dare you. How dare any of you forget about what is at stake for them this Fall.

TL;DR: If the semester ends, Cornell employees and business owners around here are going to get put in a very rough place, and it’s hard to watch people disregard that.",PLEASE consider what a shut down would mean for the people who work here,697,0.96,im6ysn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/im6ysn/please_consider_what_a_shut_down_would_mean_for/,70,1599212857.0,2020-09-04 04:47:37
AEP_god,"  The year is 2037. “America” is synonymous with “Cornell.”

During the 2020-2025 COVID-19 pandemic, Cornell was the only university to succeed in reopening, a Herculean effort that bankrupted every other university in the nation. With its multi-trillion dollar endowment it accumulated from the donations of billionaires from around the world, who lauded the success of the Big Red Vaccine, Cornell bought every other university in America. 

I’m a 2036 graduate living in New York City. Today is job enrollment day. Since my enrollment window isn’t until 4:00 PM, I decided to head down to the local Nasties to pick up some buffalo wings and signature Cornell ice cream. 

As I’m waiting in line, I overhear someone talking over the phone. It’s some software engineer from my class bragging about his brand new six figure salary. He got lucky with his enrollment window. I just hope there are more CS slots left, but with my time window, I’ll be lucky to land any engineering job. 

Suddenly, I hear the familiar chime of the nationwide intercom system. It’s time for the national anthem. I immediately turn toward the nearest smiling portrait of President Martha Pollack, place my right hand over my heart, and belt out my loudest “Far above Cayuga’s waters...” The man on the phone appears to pay no attention. He’s immediately grabbed by secret CCCT agents standing in line and disappeared. 

As I stand in line trembling, I can’t help but selfishly hope that his job slot becomes available by my 4:00 enrollment window.

By the time I finish singing with a “Hail, all hail, Cornell!” I’m next in line. I make my order. “That’ll be 25.00 BRBs,” the AEP bot-cashier beeps. Since the collapse of the dollar back in ‘21, Big Red Bucks have been the official currency of the United States of Cornell. I swipe my ID card, but it gets declined. Oh no! I forgot BRBs don’t roll over month-to-month. Embarrassed, I run back to my dorm room in Low Rise 21756. 

I check the time. It’s 3:55 PM. I hop on my computer and enter my Net-ID: ab345287 and my password into Citizen Center. Before I enroll, I have time to vote in the annual presidential election. I click on the election tab, fully expecting the usual two options: Martha Pollack and Martha Pollack. But, to my surprise, I’m instead offered the options of Martha Pollack and Walker White! He must’ve hacked the election! I eagerly click on his name and submit my ballot. 

Suddenly, my internet goes out. *This must’ve been a test, and I’ve failed*, I think to myself while bracing against the back wall of my dorm room as I wait for the CCCT to bust down my door. But nothing happens. My internet comes back on. The ballot now has the two usual options. Dejected, I cast my vote for Martha Pollack and head to the enrollment page. 

It’s now 3:59. I’m watching the second hand of the clock app on my phone. Just as it strikes 12, I click “enroll.” The page buffers. A minute passes. Then another. Finally, I’m greeted with my career options. The only slots left are in the fine arts. Without a CS slot available, not even 56 years of programming experience could grant me a software engineering job. Crying, I choose to be a painter. My projected annual salary is 10,000 BRBs. I have 400,000 BRBs in student debt. Can I even pay monthly interest? 

Before I can do the math, my door explodes and I’m placed in handcuffs. “Citizen,” an officer addresses me, “with your projected annual salary of 10,000 BRBs, you will be unable to pay the annual 100,000 BRB citizen tuition. As such, you have been found in violation of Amendment 35 of the Cornell Compact. Your diploma is hereby null and void and you are to be expelled from Cornell immediately.” 

I’m sent to Canada, where I decide to enroll in the newly founded community college known as Harvard, renowned for being a refuge for Cornell rejects.",A Cornell Dystopia,667,0.98,ieo7ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/ieo7ct/a_cornell_dystopia/,29,1598151493.0,2020-08-22 21:58:13
MemeFrom94,"Hello, 

sorry to interrupt your memes, trust me it's not something I enjoy doing, but in this chaotic moment I feel compelled to write this. 

I am a dining employee from Willard Straight Hall in my first year working for Cornell Dining. I wanted to take a moment away from all of the craziness that is happening this semester to show my appreciation for the students of Cornell.   


When I first accepted my position at Cornell, I was terrified at the thought of working around so many people. I have had social anxiety issues for over a decade now, and having a constant reminder of the bad in the world through media has never made things easier for me. Making the step to work for Cornell Dining was a huge hurdle for me mentally that I still struggle with from time to time, but I can tell you, that those days are becoming less and less the longer I work at Cornell. A large part of why these days are becoming less frequent is due to the outstanding character of the students of Cornell.

&#x200B;

There are so many of you that I get to make pizzas for on a daily basis. I see many of you multiple times a week, and even the few of you that I only get to interact with every once in a while constantly remind me how great the Cornell community is! I've worked in food service since I was 16 years old and in every other job I've worked, I've always felt like I'm ""just the guy making this persons food"", however; that changed significantly when I started working at Cornell. At Cornell, there hasn't been one time where I have felt disrespected, or just felt like the guy making your food. I constantly feel as though many of you genuinely care about us dining employees, and you truly appreciate the effort we make!  


I probably wouldn't have ever made this post until this last week. With all the chaos, and madness surrounding the Coronavirus and what it means for everyone on campus one thing became shockingly clear to me, there is no where else in the world I'd rather be working right now than Cornell. In a time where many of you are scared, and worried about what comes next for you, a lot of you still took a moment to ask a lot us dining employees what all of this meant for us and our jobs. 

&#x200B;

I have never felt more cared for by strangers in my life than I have felt this week. A student even took the time to write our bosses an email saying how much they appreciated the work we have done for them, and the seamless transition we made to make our dining halls as safe as we possibly can during this time. If you happen to read this, I want to make sure you know that your letter made so many people feel good about what we do, there were tears in the eyes of multiple people in the room as the email was read aloud to all of us. This moment is incredibly scary for us as we aren't sure exactly whats going to happen to dining over the next couple of weeks since it seems like everything could change an hour from now but knowing that there is an entire campus of students who genuinely care about our well being honestly means the world to us all.

&#x200B;

Lastly, due to all of this craziness, I hate the fact that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to many of the seniors who have already left campus that I was able to make food for regularly and at many points get to have conversations with. If any of you happen to be reading this, I wish you all nothing but the absolute best and I'm so sorry you're not able to spend your last semester as I'm sure you envisioned it, but there is no doubt in my mind that many of you are going to change the world for the better since many of you have already done that for my life.

&#x200B;

Thanks for allowing me to share my thoughts and serve you all. I look forward to seeing you all when everyone can come back to campus, I know things are crazy right now but I have nothing but faith in you all to absolutely crush it for the remainder of this semester...now back to the memes.",Appreciation Letter to Students from Dining Employee,647,1.0,fie8la,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/fie8la/appreciation_letter_to_students_from_dining/,5,1584196277.0,2020-03-14 09:31:17

At least at school, I had my friends to motivate me, but here, well, there's no one. I can't even go to therapy anymore because I know my parents will overhear and LOL I don't even want to know what will happen. As shitty as Cornell Health was at least it was something. 

I'm probably like 10 lectures behind in everything and I'm not sure if I'm gonna pass all my classes.

But guys, I've done it. I at least wrote down everything I needed to get done. All 243 items. For the first time in a month, I have made a calendar. For the first time in a month, I've watched a lecture and I even took notes.

throwaway123452165,"My favorite cousin, who is 21 years old and healthy on all scales, has recently passed from complications due to a blood clot formed in her brain from the coronavirus. It was all very quick- her family did not even know she was positive when suddenly she said she couldn't move anything on her left side of her body and was rushed immediately to the ER where she died not long after. I'm still in shock and am afraid for my life everytime I leave my home.

The most unfair part about this is that she observed all the rules. She wore a mask, she tried her best to keep 6 ft from everyone and only went out to work at her job since she is an essential worker and my cousins family needs her income to live paycheck to paycheck. I just saw a post on this subreddit about someone who doesn't observe these simple rules and it PISSED me off. Idealistically, if most people observed the rules, we might have been able to flatten this curve earlier and maybe one of my favorite people on this planet wouldn't have died. I'm so angry with this world right now because it seems like people like me who are low income who HAVE to work to afford basic necessities are most at risk due to assholes like u/ascape2 who ignore precautions and asymptomatically spread the virus to us.

I also realize most people on reddit do follow the rules and wear masks and such, and so this post probably won't make much of a difference, but I hope it inspires at least one person to start following the rules. We as young healthy college students may not be the highest at-risk demographic, but we aren't immune to the virus and never know what could happen.

dead_passions,"Hey there professors, 

I used to love the subjects and content you taught, and I used to love what you've taken the time to show me. In my time as a physics student, I've seen abstract, complex concepts hidden in the most ordinary of objects. I'm sure I don't need to explain to you the joys of discovering these things; you've all dedicated a large share of your lives to these subjects of your passion. What I'm not so sure you're aware of is this: you guys and I (I guess it's mostly me, but I don't for a moment pretend I'm solely responsible) have made this past semester a living hell for me.

I'm writing this in the wake of my PHYS 3318 final, which was due at 1:30 am. I'm writing this because I dont know where else to put it, I don't want to sleep, I'm not just here to whine and I simply don't know what to do anymore. After this last exam, the original plan was to sleep right away and be done with my semester, but instead I stayed up, sat on the living room carpet, and cried. Even though I ran out of time at the 1:30am mark I just turned in my incomplete exam and kept going until 3, I couldn't come to terms with sleeping 3 hours a day for the past two months for these classes just to demonstrate to myself in 5 hours that I've basically learned nothing. All the loss and soul sucking among of work I've gone through in the past semester culminating in half a test I've no clue how to do. I wanted there to be something I could do, but there wasn't it was over, and so I sobbed my heart out. It's not your fault and again it isn't completely mine either, but I felt robbed, robbed of my family, deprived of my health, deprived of my passion, I gave it my all and now it's all over before I had a chance to try.

During the three week break I studied nonstop until 2am to catch up and gain some mastery over my courses, and when classes started up again and 2am wasnt enough, I stayed up until 4am to get problem sets done. I rewatched lectures, took additional notes, worked examples through myself, and went to office hours. When office hours didn't work since the UTAs there were given no solutions, vetting, or training, and only gave ""yep! You're on the right track! That looks right to me!"" I stared at problem sets on my own afterward, and prayed I could finish them before the end of the week. You guys weren't making it easy either, since when I went to you professors for help all I got was the same ""great! Figure it out, interesting stuff! Don't worry you'll be fine!"" as if I'm pulling an all nighter every day and gonna be fine, when every problem is a challenge problem and is worded vaguely and the slightest misinterpretation of the problem could land me a C grade for that week's homework. All this time I'm suffocating and have to take care of my mother, who is ailing in health but is more concerned about my hospitalized grandmother and she was right to worry because in April she passed away and I remember that day we heard the news and all I remember really feeling was stress about finishing this weeks damned math and physics psets on time. As if I wasn't heartless enough of an ingrate when my mother passed away this month and I had to call the ambulance not knowing if she was going to be okay I kept thinking about the stupid curve on that prelim, how if she was hospitalized I wouldn't have enough study time, I hated myself for it then and I hate myself now. It's insane, comical even that I'm here writing about my deceased mother and grandmother like they're just points on a timeline, I remember wanting to make my mother proud but who the hell is proud of a soulless deskbound daughter anyway, not like she's around anymore to be proud or mad or disgusted anyway. This semester's turned me into something I hate, when I was crying earlier I remembered all the movies we said we'd watch together and how she would teach me to crotchet when I had time and I see what I've really ruined, all because I was so busy putting out these fires in my academics. 

I hate being melodramatic and exaggerative, but said as plainly as possible, I'm not so much angry as I am simply spent emotionally. Now that I'm at the end of the semester, I compare what I've lost to what it ended up being for, and it kills me that now I've ended up doing all this to have to choose which classes to S/U among lousy b range grades. Physics is clearly not for me, and yet I do not know what else I could do with myself. I just want it all to end. In retrospect, it was naive of me to think that Cornell is an idyllic place of learning, and that learning would come with effort. The withering cutthroat academic culture here has dug away at my passion for physics and mathematics, and I have nothing left to hold onto or be happy about. You could say I did this all to myself, but here's what infuriates me. Earlier last week, my undergraduate research PI explained to me the strict department quotas professors have for issuing grades, and how they'll do anything to create that distribution. This includes all the 15-page problem sets, those curveballs you threw right at my head on tests, all the vaguely worded challenge problems, the times you assigned an open  canvas-only notes exam, only to sneak in a few ""typos"" in key equations in the lecture notes. The questions you shrugged off one way or another, the way you mystify things, I see that your ugly side, and how you've pitted yourself against your students to produce that grade distribution. I hate that my PI pointed this out to me, it's the ugliest thing I've had to face and I still have a hard time believing the people I though my mother would be proud to see me with act with these ulterior motives. As I struggled to hold on to my sanity and family this semester, you didn't just look on. You pushed me down and held my head underwater. Well, I'm done. You win. Had I woken up to this earlier I would have tried reporting this, but you've managed to even keep me busy past course evaluations. I've spent every last shred of my will to live, act, or learn. I really hope you got your quota, and I really hope you're happy.


edit: words can't express how grateful I feel for all the support I've gotten in the past eight hours. I'm getting around to reading every dm and I feel like I'm no longer so alone. As a fairly down to earth physics girl, I never expected words from strangers to keep me going. As I've said to those of you who sent me private messages, I'm starting to gradually come up out of rock bottom, and a big part of that process is knowing I have a community who cares for me. I had zero composure while writing this post, and pouring my heart over a reddit post seemed stupid and pointless, likely to get written off as another complaining post. I only wanted to see one or two excited physics freshmen searching for physics advice here to see the struggles that Cornell really puts their students through in STEM, and expected this post to otherwise get lost in the fold of this reddit community.

To whoever gave me the platinum award, thanks a ton, but after finding out it costs money to award people on reddit, I think I should find a way to give it back. I think it should be clear I wasn't here to get ""karma"", or ""reddit gold"". Your words have been more than enough.

I want to add that after much thought and reflection I don't have any personal, hard feelings towards my professors, but rather I wanted to express the academic setup here at Cornell that has hurt so many students, but still gets accepted as almost, unavoidable, and swept under the rug, even though it is so very possible to enact change.

**I realize that I've unintentionally singled out Professor Maxson's PHYS 3318, which was not at all the central reason behind my semester of agony. Professor Maxson, if your reading this, please know that I enjoyed the fun lectures you gave us, and the contagious energy you gave to everyone in the room. It simply never matched up with the harrowing expectations in the homework and tests, which I felt I could never live up to. I hope you understand that this was the culmination of stress from all the classes in a particularly crushing semester, and I hope you understand it's nothing personal when I say I wish to remain anonymous, since I don't feel ready yet, if ever, to come forward with this. In the end, I want to thank you for reaching out. By no means was any of this anyone's fault in particular, and I hate to see you worried like this.**

**please read: I am okay, please don't call CUPD on me, those who are close to me already understand my situation and know I'm getting better.**, though I briefly contemplated suicide I never took it seriously, knowing what my mother has done to get me here to Cornell. I've removed a certain controversial line above, since I don't think it would be fair to burden my professors (who I still to some degree admire as the heroes I saw them as in high school) mentally with that kind of responsibility. I am in fairly good health, and my father has signed me up for therapy. Please don't worry about me; I wanted to delete this account, but will continue to use it, lest you guys be concerned about my kinda reckless outburst about suicide. I am faithful I'm going to get through this, though I know now **I couldn't have done it without you guys.**","You win, I guess",482,0.97,gp4m6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/gp4m6w/you_win_i_guess/,76,1590268008.0,2020-05-23 16:06:48

ruudboy2,"*excuse the long winded backstory and semi rant but I really wanted to express this*

When it first started to set in that I would be going to Cornell starting in Fall 2019, I was pretty excited but a little anxious.  I came from a tiny school (like really tiny) where everyone knew everyone else and I basically had to deal with the people that were there and make the best of it.  Now, I was jumping from a school of 80 to a school of 15,000.  I’d have a wider circle of people to choose from but obviously a more intimidating and competitive environment academically.

As soon as I arrived on campus though, I felt like there couldn’t possibly have been another place for me to go. That is all because of the people in this fine institution. People in my dorm although quite different from me were always super nice and I could always pop into their rooms to talk, play games or just chill.  My student advisor, who I assumed would be quite distant from me (being a checked out senior and all), always found time to meet with me not just for academic reasons but sometimes just to hang out and get me free ice cream from Cornell Dairy.  Lab partners and people I randomly met in my nerve wracking intro classes never hesitated to help and were always super appreciative when I helped them even if it took myself little to no effort.

Finally, I can’t stress how amazing my new closest friends at Cornell have been.  Ready to uplift, fool around, be serious and really personify the type of people Ezra Cornell wanted to attend his university.

Overall, people at Cornell are amazing and I can’t stress that enough.  Rather than bicker at each other and demonize each other for our actions, we should remember that we were all chosen to be a part of a group of students with some of the best characters you can find in life and some of the most driven and motivated people in the entire world.

stupidlyugly,"Hey everyone, 

I've been following this sub lately because my daughter is a student at Cornell.  (Dear old dad got his degree from the relatively pedestrian University of California system, so right off the bat, I'm not as smart as any of you)

We live in Texas, and my daughter arrived in Dallas last night on a previously planned weekend visit.  

We decided yesterday that it was probably wise for her to simply not return to campus, and we hoped for the best regarding scheduled mid-terms next week. 

I'm very relieved that the university decided to suspend classes today as she doesn't have to worry about negotiating with her professors.  We were really worried that if she went back on Monday, she might not be able to come back home at the end of March. 

Anywho, in following all your posts, I completely understand how stressed out everybody is.  This is certainly an unprecedented situation, and trust me, the old people are just as confused as you are and we're all trying to get through it. 

My heart goes out to the seniors who face missing graduation.  There is no spin to put on that -- it sucks. 

The best thing I can tell you is that someday when you have grandchildren, and you want to bore them to death with stories of the old days while you sip on your tipsy juice and they're getting all fidgety, this story in your lives is going to be a doozy. 

Hang tough Cornellians. It's (probably) not the end of the world.  And if it is, fuck it -- you got out of prelims for a while.  

Also, I think it's only fair that you declare both your men's and women's hockey teams national champions.  Hang those banners proudly!

(EDIT: different families both helping their kids move in) The shops are filled to the brim, even moreso than other move-in weekends I've seen. 

At this point, it's not ignorance and that can't be used as an excuse. This is willful neglect of the health and safety of the individuals of the Cornell community and Ithaca as a whole. Let's also not forget the families of those who need to work these jobs downtown to pay the bills.

I'm disappointed. We can be better than this. We need to hold ourselves and those around us more accountable.",I'm personally really dissappointed.,385,0.91,iavomr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/iavomr/im_personally_really_dissappointed/,49,1597625252.0,2020-08-16 19:47:32

**Plans are subject to change as the pandemic evolves**

**Note:** these were the things I heard/remembered and could be slightly incorrect or misinterpreted. Official information will probably be sent out in the coming weeks

# tl;dr

* Biweekly testing opportunities starting now for off-campus students
   * See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/hrpjr3/students_arriving_to_ithaca_during_the_summer_get/) by u/technophantom7
* Housing and dining cost reduced by 15% if leaving campus before Thanksgiving
* In-person attendance restricted to 50 students / class
* Have to tell Cornell if you are in Ithaca even if taking classes entirely online
* Assigned seats in all classes
* List of course **modalities** (in-person, hybrid, online) for all courses by end of July
   * Class times a week later, pre-enroll after that
* Two rounds of pre-enroll, limited number of credits first, remaining credits later
   * Seniority based as always
* 18 credit cap
   * Seniors can petition if needed to graduate
   * Everyone gets to petition for 1 additional ""learning opportunity"" (project team, research, etc.)
* Housing assignments **July 24**
* Move in for on campus is pretty whack see below
   * Different move-in dates depending on where you come from
   * Testing and quarantine
* A lot of programs planned for first-year students and families, see below
   * Mostly online but they want to try more in person if possible
* Online reporting tool for behavioral violations
   * Can get suspended or expelled.
* More of these coming up for specific groups/topics

**More details below**

# Tuition and Fees

* subsequent session specifically about finacial aid
* tuition will not be reduced but full need will continue to be met
* if family circumstances have changed, get in touch with finaid office
* additional emergency fund to support unexpected need

Housing and Dining rates

* **reduced by 15% for the Fall semester** due to shorter on-campus semester
* option for those who wish to remain (similar to spring), full charge for housing and dining

# Academics

3 modalities to instruction:

* In-person instruction
   * Expectation that you will be attending in person
   * In-person attendance capped at **50** students (seems like a big lecture hall could fit more but ok)
* Hybrid  - rotational model to account for constrained classroom space.
   * Alternating pattern throughout the semester
   * Students will not get to choose which rotation they attend
* Fully online instruction

You **can** take entirely online classes while living in Ithaca, but you will be expected to register your presence in Ithaca, and follow the Cornell Behavioral Compact.

Safety in the classroom

* 3000+ rooms used for academic activities, each with occupancy revised to account for 6 feet physical distancing
* HVAC systems being assessed
* **Assigned seats**
* Masks in the classroom
* Enhanced cleaning

Enrollment

* for each course, faculty and TAs decide modality
* in-person class capacities are being re-scaled (reduced) for some courses
* List of courses and modalities by **end of July**
   * Course times a week later
   * Enrollment after that
* Seniors enroll in a **limted number of credits** first, then juniors, sophomores, etc. Meant mostly for courses with in-person instruction.
   * Second round of enrollment for remaining credits
   * Goal is to preserve seniority but distribute in-person seats among students from all years.

Credit Cap

* 18 credit cap
* Considerations:
   * No breaks, many additional stress factors anticipated this semester
   * Based on mental health review, found that students who take a normal load feel inadequate when compared to their peers - trying to reduce this
* **Seniors** will be able to petition for more credits to graduate
* Petition at the college level for **1 additional learning opportunity**
   * TA job
   * Project team
   * supplemental course (AEW? unclear)
   * Research

Exams

* ""semi-final"" exams before Thanksgiving
   * In person for students on campus/in Ithaca, even if class is entirely online
   * Did not explicitly mention exams for students not in Ithaca, likely still online. 

* Most other schools in the country are doing graded - would be a bad look for grad school if Cornell didn't return to normal.

# Accommodations

Zebadiah Hall, Director of Student Disability Services

* The process to get accommodations will not be ""medicalized""
   * Medical records will not always be necessary
* Modalities are meant to allow SDS to support most vulnerable students

# Health, Safety, & Testing

Dr. Gary Koretzky, VP Academic Integration

* Ongoing public health campaign - lots of information planned
* **Asymptomatic spread is real**

The approach:

1. Mitigate viral spread - inevitable that people on campus will get it.

* Hand sanitizer stations around campus
* If inside any building aside from your dorm room, private office, required to wear a mask
* If in a group outside, need to wear a mask
* If outdoors alone, have a mask visible and ready for when you encounter someone
* Limit gatherings
* No visitors
* Discourage travel

1. Testing

* Collaboration with Cayga Medical Center
* Testing for the **presence of the virus**  (not antibodies)
* Daily self-assessment check-in with Cornell Health (didn't explain how this happens)
* Free testing
   * Started this week: bi-weekly testing clinic for **off-campus residents** \- **registration required**
   * Testing for on-campus residents **built into move-in process**
* **Get tested at home** before coming to school
* Frequent testing once the semester starts

throw_awayfrommebaby,"
Although I am based in Ithaca, all of my classes are online this semester. This is by design. 


Taking online classes, I find I have more time for myself. Not having to travel class to class, being able to catch up on my own time if I miss a lecture, being able to fast forward or rewind as many times as I like without judgment if a professor straight up made no fucking sense-- it's good for me. 


With this newfound freedom, I had the chance to organize myself. For the first time in years, I have routines. And they're healthy ones. 


With this extra time, especially during last spring, I was able to reflect on what really mattered to me. I assessed my life, and what I wanted out of it. Was I happy where I was? No. How was I going to address that?


Last spring, I started seeing a therapist. This summer, I started taking antidepressants. For the first time in my life, I've actually started studying for classes-- I passed a class I would have otherwise failed because of this.


 I work out 45+ minutes a day. I wake up at 7 AM and go to sleep around midnight. I've started reading and drawing again.


I have rediscovered lost passions. My highschool harped on passion and purpose, and I felt like I never really understood. Like I failed highschool because I didnt figure those things out for myself. But now? I understand myself so much better than I ever have before.


I'm in regular contact with the people I care about. I dress well, and my place is clean. I eat surprisingly well. I am altogether much kinder to myself, and am managing my depression and anxiety. I am the closest I've been to happy in a long, long time. 


And I can say for certain that I would not be in this position if I had to attend classes in person. Honestly, I could fail most of my classes this semester, and I dont think it would make me upset. Because I have such serenity in my life and clarity of my mind right now, and that matters so much more to me. My life is more than my performance in class. My life is holistic, and for the first time in a long time, I have the room to pay attention to those other parts of my life that have gone neglected. I feel more complete. I feel like a person.",being online has been beneficial for me.,381,0.99,inyl0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/inyl0x/being_online_has_been_beneficial_for_me/,38,1599472137.0,2020-09-07 04:48:57

ProfTownsend,"Hello everyone. I am teaching MATH 2940 (Linear Algebra for Engineers) in the Fall 2020. I am also chairing the Engineering Liaison committee in 20/21, which advises instructors on how to teach any math class with a large enrollment of engineering students. There are some hard restraints from Cornell: (1) Letter grading schemes, (2) In-person and online parts of the course (MATH 2940 lectures will be online), (3) Staffing resources, and (4) Other covid-19 protocols. Within those restraints, though, there is a lot of freedom on how teach a class. While I have heard lots of opinions from faculty on how to teach, examine, grade, and engage with students during Fall 2020, I would also like to understand your thoughts, suggestions, and concerns too.   I would like to hear any suggestions you have for MATH 2930, MATH 2940, etc.?

Literally all you have to do is pay $7.50 in BRB and commit to rinsing your container after each use. We are Cornell students and we should be more conscious of our waste! Making this small change is easy and it will keep dozens of your unnecesary waste from the landfill.

sublimedot,"Hey everyone. I'm a rising senior who is graduating in December. So, this is my last semester of undergrad. I'm going to explain why I've chosen to stay home and do online classes this semester, as sad and disappointed as I am. This was not an easy choice, and something I've been thinking about for weeks now. I hope this helps anyone who is still uncertain about their decision on whether to go back or not.

I've had a great three years at Cornell. I have a great group of friends. I am part of multiple clubs and am an active member of Greek life. With that being said, pre-Covid meant that I would regularly go out 2-3 nights a week. Once Covid hit, I was one of the students who opted to stay in their off-campus housing, and even continued to go out once everyone else left. Ithaca felt like a safe bubble, unaffected by the rest of the world. My real wake up call came when someone I was in mild contact with was diagnosed with Covid early April. It was shocking and frightening. My roommate and I were contacted via contact tracing and were required to quarantine in our apartment for 2 weeks. We lived in constant fear that every cough or sneeze was 'it'. Luckily, we didn't have it, but that scare was horrible.

Fast forward to the end of April when I returned home. Where I live, people were being diagnosed at that time at thousands per day. I didn't realize the extent and seriousness of this disease until then. I have pretty bad anxiety which made it so difficult for me to leave my house. Even going for a walk felt like a potential war zone. I wondered whether the jogger in front of me had Covid and if I could have gotten it from them, or the guy at the grocery store who was wearing his mask below his nose. Every outing felt, and has felt, like a huge risk.

I have friends (in Greek life and beyond) who have stayed in Ithaca during the summer. In case you guys don't have friends up there right now, I can promise you that there are parties every. single. night. Oh, and during the day. The students up there are being negligent. I have even heard stories of people 'turning' and blaming one another because there have been mild outbreaks amongst party goers in the past few weeks. It literally pains me to see some students on social media doing shots in a crowded apartment one night, and then see them return home to their families a few hours away a few days later.

'Social compact' or not, students ARE going to go out. The bars in Collegetown are going to be breeding grounds for the virus. Before Hideaway was shut down a few weeks ago (I assume for violating social distancing laws), they posted Snapchats of NO ONE wearing a mask and it was  packed. For some reason, the majority of young people truly think they are invincible to Covid. We hear of the few people we know that have had it say that it isn't worse than any other cold or flu. But a quick Google search will bring up dozens of people in their 20's who have died. Some have died of sudden strokes due to the virus. Many of these people were healthy college students, even college athletes.

I don't mean to be apocalyptic or scare anyone. This is just my thinking and I wanted to share. I want to reiterate that you are in charge of your own behavior. However, you can't fully control what your roommate does or who they see. You can't control who the person sitting next to you in class or walking in front of you down a hall does or who they see. Scientists simply don't know everything about this disease and how it spreads. If it is as airborne as they say, lecture halls and dorms may be petri dishes for the disease. The 'solution' isn't to *only* call out specific organizations or groups of people. This isn't *just* a Greek life problem. This is a student body issue that requires collective action. However, I fear that as emerging adults, our underdeveloped ways of thinking will prohibit the rational behavior needed to keep us and others safe. 

To me, the risk is NOT worth the reward. This semester's experience will not compare to the typical Cornell we all know and love. I can't imagine the constant fear of questioning whether you have come into contact with someone with Covid. Odds are, you WILL come into contact with someone with the virus and will have to quarantine. President Pollack herself said their models predict somewhere near one-thousand students getting it. The constant switching between in-person and online classes (due to hybrid schedules or forced quarantines) would personally disrupt my workflow and increase my anxiety.

It's my last semester, and to me, it's not worth the risk. If you have a safe and stable home environment, and believe you can do another round of Zoom, I personally suggest it. I can almost promise the social compact will not work, based on our own peers' behavior.

If anyone wants to talk about their own decision, feel free to PM me. Remember, this is just my own take on the situation, and I don't mean to spark a debate. Just be smart, but realize that those around you may not be making the best choices. Stay safe everyone!",Why I'm Staying Home...

ProfessorMeowSteve,"Much ado has been made over the various grading systems that Cornell could implement this semester, but I’m surprised that nobody has suggested the following policy that would both settle the grading debate and also the BRB problem faced by students:

All Cornell dining plans (that I’m aware of) provide students with some amount of BRB’s at the start of each semester. I propose that professors grade assignments as they normally would, but before returning grades to students they would multiply each student’s grade by the ratio of that student’s remaining BRB balance to the amount of BRB’s allocated to that student at the beginning of the semester. For example, say Bill has the House Meal Plan, which provides $400 in BRB’s per semester. If Bill has $200 remaining BRB’s and scores 100 on a test, then they would receive a final grade of a 50. This might seem unfair, but recognize that rationing is important in these times, not just of food, medicine, and toilet paper, but also of happiness. Bill experienced joy from spending $200 BRB’s throughout the semester, so the unhappiness he experiences when he receives a failing grade in a core class that he worked really hard in balances out his previously experienced joy, leaving Bill in a state of happiness equilibrium.

Of course, not all students have dining plans, so what should be made of their situation? Since these students have a level of detachment from Cornell and campus life, they should automatically get an “S” that stands for “Strange” because they’re not like the rest of us. If they want a letter grade then they should be given the opportunity to forsake personal economy in the name of conformity by signing up for a Cornell meal plan despite their inability to use it. 

One last point of interest is the fact that BRB’s carry over from fall semester to spring semester. Thus, one could theoretically have carried over BRB’s from fall semester and not spent many BRB’s from their current semester’s allotment and ended up with a BRB ratio greater than 1. There is no problem in this, as it rewards students who believed in the validity and growth of BRB’s as a currency. With the recent hits to the values of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, allowing students to have, say, a 125% grade multiplier will assure that BRB’s don’t experience a similar drop in value faced by other mediums of exchange.

I shall bring forth this proposal directly to Martha, and I expect it to be adopted very soon. I apologize to any of you who spent all of your BRB’s at Bear Necessities or Jansen’s, but know that this plan is the only fair solution.",Petition to grade based on remaining BRB balance,333,0.97,fra9ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/fra9ll/petition_to_grade_based_on_remaining_brb_balance/,6,1585534152.0,2020-03-29 21:09:12

OrganizeAndAdvocate,"I’m a PhD student teaching an FWS (throwaway account). I’ve seen a lot of posts and comments about professors increasing the workload and not being accommodating to students’ needs during this crisis. I want you to know that your anger is completely justified and that this is absolutely not ok.

We as teachers/profs have received very strong guidelines about how to conduct the rest of the semester. We are required to be accommodating and very strongly encouraged to rework our syllabus and reduce the workload. I have personally cut the workload for my FWS significantly and I think all professors should do so. *Increasing* the workload is ludicrous and explicitly goes against Cornell’s guidelines.

I highly encourage undergraduates to organize and advocate for yourselves. In classes where professors are doing this, don’t just post on Reddit or complain to your friends. Advocate for yourselves. But be cautious about doing it alone: individual emails can single you out and expose you to possible backlash. Talk to other students. Collect and compile your complaints. Submit them to the professor, anonymously if necessary. And if your professor refuses to change, then take it to your department or your dean. I think they will put significant pressure on professors who are doing this. Change can and will happen if you organize.

If you do this, you might also want to reach out to Cornell Graduate Students United. As grad students we have our own major problems to deal with right now, but I think you would find support from us.

rwaterbender,"As the decade comes to a close and we draw 10 years closer to the impending climate apocalypse, the moderators of r/Cornell thought the timing was apt for a history lesson, because we know how much y'all love breadth requirements.   
  
The Cornell subreddit was, apparently, created roughly 10 years ago by u/drboda, who has been inactive for the last 10 years and has fewer posts on his account than I can count on one hand. It is truly remarkable that the spirit of this subreddit's founder has survived intact in its current users. Speaking of which, we have gone from just u/drboda and his alts to 16,674 readers at the time of writing, of which at this time approximately 22 AEP majors are active. We've also grown to a daily subscription rate in the mid double digits, and a monthly view rate of over 2 million for each of the last 2 months, of which, again, about 22 were unique. Through that time, we've seen moderators come and go, including u/laveritecestla (AEP '18) and u/TheD3xus (AEP MS '19), who recently graduated and who you may be familiar with. Some grad student and alumni lurkers may even be familiar with even older mods such as u/ConvexPreferences (unflaired), u/Enyo287 (graduation date unknown), u/TheIndigoSky (AEP '14) and u/SamuelGompers (EP '13), who had to be removed by force by reddit admins some time ago. He was actually so old AEP hadn't yet rebranded and was known as just EP. Some speculate this is due to Cornell's recent trend of grade inflation, before which there were no As given. Let that serve as a reminder: things could always be worse.     
  
If you're currently a Cornell student, you were probably between 7-14 years old at the start of the decade. Some of you probably spoke no English at that time or lived in a totally different country. Many of you probably didn't even know what Cornell was, or had never thought about going to college at all. We're 100% sure you were all fucking nerds tho.     
     
The world has changed a lot since 2010. Back then Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen was one of the most popular shows on television. People watched the Office on NBC, not Netflix. Snapchat didn't exist and Uber was a year old. The most popular song of 2010 was TiK ToK. Now it's an app, and owned by China.   
  
Cornell has changed a lot too. In 2010 our President was not Martha Pollack, a CS theorist, but James Skorton, a cardiologist. Imagine hiring someone to run a university who makes financial decisions like majoring in psychology. Martha has an h-index of 51. We didn't make that up, fucking chad she is. David motherfucking Gries has an h-index of 40. Who has more programming experience now, bitch?  
  
Some of the people reading this are probably ED admits or even RD applicants, so it seems appropriate to discuss how the university has changed in this regard, too. For the class of 2023, Cornell had an overall admission rate of 10.6%, and an ED rate of 22.6%. For the class of 2014, the statistics were 18.4% and 32.7%, respectively. By contrast, Harvard's admission stats were 7% for RD and no one knows the EA rate because they apparently didn't have it. Cornell's RD rate in 2018 was 8%, to put that in perspective. Idk about the rest of you, but this was actually more in line with current numbers than I expected. Notably, just 4 years earlier (Class of 2010) the admissions rate was actually 25%, with an ED rate of 40% for Cornell, and 9% and 20% for Harvard. I know this because I accidentally looked up these statistics instead of the relevant ones from a decade ago. Oops.    
    
Speaking of mistakes, let's go over some of the big ones. The 2010s looked so promising coming in, and yet we all ended up at Cornell. We are sincerely disappointed in all of you. More seriously, we made many mistakes this decade as a species, and learned from few of them. I'm going to get political for a moment. In 2010, we finally came together to give healthcare to the American people. 10 years later, we need GoFundMe to cover basic operations. In 2010, we elected the most conservative generation of politicians ever to the US government. Now, in 2019, we are poised to do the same again. Globally, Occupy Wall Street and the Arab Spring signaled a departure from the systemic oppression of earlier eras. Today, people in Hong Kong fight to defend their basic liberties from a dictator, and we deface even meager symbols of support for their people. But hey, at least we got some good memes out of it.           
   
Perhaps the greatest growth in the 2010s has been in the meme sector. One of the most popular memes of 2010 was a picture of Keanu Reeves. People still get massive karma with the same exact picture of Keanu Reeves. In 2010, people got their memes on reddit and cheezburger. Now, people still get their memes on reddit. Truly a transformative decade it has been.    
  
We want to give a shoutout to the r/Cornell community. Y'all are pretty dank. This community is by far the best Ivy shitposting subreddit, not that we really have any competition. But we are also helpful, welcoming, and insightful. Everyone in this subreddit contributes positively to the community, and we all really enjoy helping to keep this community spam-free for all of you.   
    
Here's to the continued perpetual growth of the AEP major, and another decade as the #1 Ivy shitposting sub. Whether you had a great decade or a shitty one, keep in mind: in just 100 more years, you'll finally be allowed to talk about 2110 finals on this sub again, and maybe Gries will even join you himself. Until then, shut the fuck up, and have a happy new year.

shutuppleasepeople,"This has probably been the hardest time of my life. My autistic brother has been in and out of the hospital for the past year due to his seizures. Because of that, we had some medical debt which at the time seemed negligible and now is a lot more burdensome. And now both my parents have lost their jobs -- so we are all now working at Amazon just to survive. Now I'm having to balance working at a wearhouse (even though I have moderate asthma and am high risk for covid 19), taking care of my nonverbal brother who needs constant attention and doing school. It's already been a shit year due me always worrying about my brother and now it's worse. 

But the bright light in all of this? I told my professors about my situation and they all understand. They were willing to be flexible with me and even gave me tips on how to manage my time. The professor I do research with even offered to pay me double so I can reduce my hours at amazon. I cried when I heard that.

jefferyg,"At the end of my sophomore fall semester, I got a C in a core class I expected a B/B+. Exam grades weren’t being posted on Blackboard. Emailed the course email and they said the reason I got a C was bc it appeared I didn’t take the final (I did) so they gave me a zero. Led to some frantic email exchanges, but the TA eventually found it stuck to the bottom of the box where the exams were kept, scored it, and told me over email my new grade. I thanked the TA but *politely* added that I should’ve been contacted to confirm if I didn’t take the exam, instead of just assigning a 0 and not telling me until I inquired. 

Professor later chimed in and took it personally. He emailed me saying he was “not obligated to change my grade”, also somehow found a way to blame me 100% for the fact that they missed finding my exam. Prof said he wasn’t gonna entertain any discussion on the topic until I came in and saw him in his office when the spring semester began. 

Kept me stressed out the entire winter break, and I feared any retaliation on my end would make him unwilling to fix my grade at all, so I sucked it up and accepted all the blame during the meeting, at which point he was satisfied and changed the grade.

sforsierra,"Canceling classes seems a wishful thinking to many of us, but we need to have realistic expectations and better prepare ourselves for various contingencies. These are my recommendations.

1. Expectation of Class Cancellation: Governor Cuomo said at today's morning conference that if there is a confirmed positive case at a school, that school will be shut down for 24 hours to assess its situation. This seems to apply across the New York state at all levels of school. This is the absolute latest you can expect the school being closed. What is a likely scenario? If you look at the NYS map how epidemiologically the virus is spreading, it is creeping upward (e.g. Manhattan, Westchester, Albany, etc). As soon as the red portion of the map hits anywhere within 1-60mi (Binghamton or Syracuse), we might take a similar course of action Columbia or Princeton took: go Online now or after the spring break.
2. Cases IVO Ithaca: There is a third case pending results in Ithaca, and the Tompkins County Health Dept will make an announcement today at 2pm. I looked them on Google.
3. Preparedness: Continuity in education and public health are important. Register for the Cornell Zoom as I have already done since there is a flagged message on Canvas. Make your room organized and clean for both studies and good hygiene. Get food and drinks in the case that someone really close to you gets tested positive and the entire hallway or building is on a lock-down. Make alternative plans for the spring break and use discretion for long-distance travels. Produce contingency plans for summer (and winter) regarding internship, going home, etc. AS NY just surpassed WA in terms of the confirmed cases, this is a good time to actually sit down and think through your back-up plans.
4. Dr. Anthony Fauci (Cornell Alum) says it will take a 1-1.5 year to have a viable vaccine against COVID19. This means worrying too much is better than being naively optimistic (e.g. heat will kill the virus). WASH YOUR HANDS and possibly use gloves to open doors, press elevator buttons, and etc. Practice social distancing.
5. I have seen a post that talks about someone's boyfriend coming to Ithaca who is traveling from Westchester. Do you know what Governor Cuomo said this morning? New Rochelle is the hotbed for coronavirus right now in NY. Convince the person not to travel this weekend to Ithaca. This goes to any non-committal social, athletic, and other events. If an event has a chance to put one of us in a cluster, use your discretion and practice social distancing, and possibly urge for cancellation of the event not just passive non-participation.

StarksTwins,"Last night a young woman got on the bus, when she realized she forgot her student ID at home. 

The bus driver tried to kick her off the bus. She, nor any of her friends, had the $1.50 for the toll. She literally had to go passenger to passenger and beg for money. If my girlfriend didn’t have a bunch of random change in her pocketbook, she would’ve been forced off. 

To me, that should be absolutely unacceptable. 

For one, she’s a Cornell student, it was after 7:00, and the ride were free anyways. 

For two, it was **-7°** outside. 

And lastly, it was midnight. 

I feel like someone should be ashamed of themselves for trying to force young woman at midnight in literally deadly temperatures to walk home because she didn’t have a dollar 50. 

Does anyone know a good person from TCAT to reach out to about the situation? Is the situation even worth reaching out for? Like I get it, she shouldn’t have forgotten her ID. But to try to keep her stranded miles away from home because she didn’t have spare change is downright cruel.",Kind of disgusted of what I witnessed on TCAT last night,289,0.94,f4abxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/f4abxz/kind_of_disgusted_of_what_i_witnessed_on_tcat/,45,1581806900.0,2020-02-15 16:48:20
im-a-little-shy,"I'll preface this by saying I identify as a liberal, but sometimes I feel a little silenced by people at Cornell who kinda use the ""my way of thinking is the only right way and if you think otherwise you must be racist"" argument to cancel your opinion. The most recent place I saw this was under the Cornell Daily Sun's FB post on someone's opinion article about how the SAFC shouldn't have just decided for themselves that they could donate $10K of the student activities fees to the Cornell Students 4 Black Lives fundraiser. (Let me know if you need a link but it's not too far down their current FB page). Even though the writer's opinion was unpopular, I feel like the comments section quickly became an unsafe space for any open dialogue about the matter.

If you read the person's article, many of his points actually make a lot of sense? Like although I'm personally ok with having that money go towards the fundraiser, I understand why someone else wouldn't want that decided for them (after all this is our parents money). But I guess besides that, I think the way people have been handling conservative points of views at Cornell hasn't been the best, like accusing people of being racist just because they're in the Cornell Republicans isn't going to change their mindset. And for people like me, who wholeheartedly support the BLM movement and actively make donations to different supporting orgs, I also feel like I can't openly share my opinion without being berated for not being a good ally.

I'm sorry if this comes off offensive in any way. I'm just not sure how I feel about the tension between Cornell students right now and was wondering if other people felt this way. If I'm totally out of line, please educate me.

Edit: For context in light of all the new posts that are surfacing, I don't think the SAFC should take away the money that's already been donated to C4BL. I just think the guy who disagreed deserved a safe space to talk about the decision without being accused of racism.

cornell-Coronavirus,"There seems to be an impression among a lot of people that those who opposed opt-in are ""finance people who fucked up their first prelims"" or ""C students who want the easy pass."" I don't think a lot of people understand what others are going through and generalize stuff, so here's an anecdote that isn't representative of the whole because there are no surveys relating people at Cornell with what grading choice they advocated.

I'm a low income student. I'm also a minority. This of course extends to my family. I have 6 siblings, 4 of which moved out of our house already, leaving me the oldest of the children left living with my parents. My family is 3-months behind on mortgage now, in-part because we've had to send a lot of that money to my older sister who's job as a waitress isn't doing well right now. If we miss another payment, it's eviction time.  I've applied to multiple jobs already because we need money coming in, this will obviously get in the way of my studies but who cares, I'm probably a C student anyways, right?

Well actually, this is the one time I can brag about my situation before I get into the depressing bits. I'm a really good student and I'm proud of that, sophomore with ~3.9 gpa in engineering and that was staying on course during this semester too, getting above a std dev over mean on all my prelim 1s and an A on all my essays so far. I also really wanna go to grad school. But we'll come back to all that, now a bit of somber shit to soak up this r/humblebrag.

So that was over a week ago, but things progress in pandemics. So a different older sister (we'll call her sister 2) of mine has asthma and is sick dealing with what may very well be coronavirus. Now statisically, U.S. minorities (black people in particular, which I happen to be,) don't really trust the medical system here. For reasons why just look up the wealth of research done on how fucked up and biased the medical system is towards white people (particularly white men). Because of this mistrust in the system, a mistrust that- although dangerous and possibly deadly, exists for a very good reason, she refuses to go get tested and is in self-isolation. Sister 2 is also out of a job but she had saved a little bit to fall back on, unlike sister 1. That won't last too long but should keep her well for at least a couple months. But he'd situation has been clouding my mind for a while.

My older brother kept working during the pandemic at his job, which was allowed to stay open but did not protect its employees. They've had 18 cases and one death now. He's immunocompromised due to a previous health condition about a decade ago. He's in self isolation in his house too. His job has finally closed down after that death came out. I now have this on my mind. He now has no form of income as well. Both him and sister 1 will have to file for unemployment but it takes a while for that paperwork to process and that first check to come in.

My last older sister is pregnant and single, and her job as a sex worker in a different country really does not help with both the coronavirus epidemic nor the pregnant situation. I also have this constantly bombarding my mind.

My younger brother is on the verge of staying back so I will also have to begin tutoring him. He's always had issues focusing in school and now that he's gone full online he's having even more issues focusing. I'm also currently funding all of the groceries for my parents home right now so my savings are depleting fast. Another thing on my mind.

Finally, I'm also back in the dysfunctional low income household that I was raised in, where arguments about what bills to skip occur on a weekly basis.

I know many other low income kids in my neighborhood, and they have just as many things weighing their mind. The best thing about campus for me wasn't the resources or any of that, it was the distraction to focus and now that I'm back in the hellhole that is poverty I'm back to having things on my mind that outweigh school in priority. It's not a matter of whether I could keep my grades, I'm pretty confidant I could despite all this, but it would destroy my mental health. I was hoping for universal S/U not because I'm lazy or I'm a C student as many people seem to categorize, but because when I do eventually apply for graduate school, I don't want a lingering question of whether my rejection was for my application in whole or my S/U semester from a school where it was optional. I already deal with the lingering question of whether I was admitted to Cornell because I'm a minority, a question that eats at my confidence despite my accomplishments. There's already studies that show black minorities in particular face significant performance reducing mental strain in higher education because of a desire to combat stereotypes and whether they belong in the place they were admitted (read Thin Ice by Claude Steele for more info). Of course on top of all of this I have the more universal issues of self-esteem, body image, etc. Anyways, no matter what universities say it's really hard to make my brain believe that there will be no penalty to a s/u semester, but I also refuse to break myself for school when I need to be at top for my family to get through this.

So yeah, I'm probably gonna S/U all my classes. Just like most people my reasons for wanting my grading system of choice were inherently selfish on some level, but it's what I supported as people with situations worst than this definitely exist at Cornell and I don't think it's fair for you to make them decide on whether to go against what their brain is telling them and impact their own future or to go for the grade and take all the mental strain that comes with it. Here's hoping the people with even worst situations get through all this unscathed.

We pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition to attend this university and make use of the amazing opportunities and wonderful resources it has to offer us.

The administration now does everything within its power to try to let us all come back and keep using the university’s resources while having a safe Fall 2020 semester. 

And there will STILL be people who refuse to wear a mask and refuse to stop partying. 

For the love of God, when the semester starts back up, please wear a mask and stop partying. It’ll only be for a semester (maybe two) and you can go back to it after this all clears up. 

Just imagine: if you don’t hold parties this semester, once the pandemic clears up, I bet you the post-pandemic parties will absolutely make up for the lack of partying this semester. 

Just please wear a mask and stop partying. The effort we’ve all made to be here, as well as the loans we are taking out to receive our education here, are astronomical.

MaxwellJuniorr,"Hi, this is Martha Pollack speaking. It has recently come to my attention that some of you are worried about booking flights back to Ithaca. It appears that you cannot book a flight until you know the date that you need to arrive at your destination, and unfortunately, we have withheld that information from you, as we haven’t quite decided what font we should use for the corresponding announcement email. In this regard, I sincerely apologize; I was under the impression that every student has a private plane and that they can arrive whenever they please. Apparently though, y’all poor af (but also my b cuz I’m taking like $70,000 a year from each of you mofos). Anyways, long story short, I’m flying to the Bahamas tomorrow for a Bridge tournament, so it’s kinda too late to fix this, but you may still want to consider investing in a jet, as this will make future travel easier (sell off your car collections if you need money to fund this; trust me it’s worth it).

To help students deal with the mental stress this may be causing, I will be giving a $1 tuition refund to all students who do not own a private jet. Our mental health experts recently ran a mathematical model which showed that such a refund will drastically reduce stress for students*. Details about this refund will be released sometime in the next 1 to 254 weeks. Unfortunately, running the previously mentioned mathematical model was very expensive, so we will also have to increase tuition by 50 cents per student. But hey, that’s just 1,999,999.50 more dollars that you need till you can get that plane!!

Warmest regards,

Martha Pollack 

*model assumes 100% of students have zero dollars to begin with, such that the $1 refund leads to an infinite increase in student wealth. Model has an uncertainty range of - infinity to + infinity.",Greetings from Martha Pollack,278,0.96,hz9lna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/hz9lna/greetings_from_martha_pollack/,11,1595946722.0,2020-07-28 09:32:02

academictrash26,"A Winter Storm will impact the Northeast Sunday and Monday. Heading back to Cornell University? We’ve got you covered. Read on for a detailed forecast of the winter weather.

OVERVIEW - Snow will develop tomorrow morning around 9-10 AM in Ithaca (earlier SW, later NE) becoming moderate/heavy at times before mixing with sleet/freezing rain midday tomorrow. A lull is expected mid/late tomorrow afternoon before heavy snow returns tomorrow night. Moderate/heavy snow will continue through the day on Monday before tapering off Monday evening. The graph in the first image gives a good general idea of what to expect hour-by-hour in Ithaca in terms of precipitation intensity (top precip bar), and type (the next four bars).

TODAY 11/30/19 there is *no* snow expected. If you are travelling today from anywhere on the East Coast, or can rearrange your plans to travel this afternoon, you will not experience any interruptions as high clouds slowly spill into the northeast.

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM 12/1/19) snow will be moving into the area from the southwest. If you have an early flight from Detroit, it may be delayed but SW Michigan is expecting mostly rain, so you should be able to get out. This also applies to early flights from DC. (See Image 2)

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM) if you're driving through Pennsylvania, be extremely careful as roads will be covered in ice due to freezing rain. Interstates should be ok as road crews apply salt to keep surfaces wet, but back roads may be very slippery. Allow extra time to get here! (See Image 3)

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM) if you're driving in from the west (Buffalo, Ohio, etc.) expect rain until you get to the PA/NY border, then precipitation will change over to a mix of ice/sleet/snow. Allow plenty of extra time to get here as you'll need to take it slow

TOMORROW MORNING (6-10 AM) if you're driving in from the east (NYC, Boston, etc.) expect dry conditions until 8-10 AM when a mix of snow and sleet will begin falling. If you can get to Ithaca by 10 AM, you should avoid substantial delays. (See Image 4)

MIDDAY TOMORROW (10 AM-2 PM), we'll see a burst of heavy snow and sleet here in Ithaca likely between 10 AM and 2 PM. If you're planning on arriving during this time, expect significant delays as traffic will be moving very slowly across the entire Central NY region. (See Image 5)

MIDDAY TOMORROW (10 AM-2 PM) if you're heading through SW NY (Buffalo, Jamestown, etc.) OR north through PA, you'll be moving quite slowly through heavy freezing rain/sleet. If you're heading south from ROC/SYR OR east from ALB, you'll be moving slowly through moderate/heavy snow.

MIDDAY TOMORROW (10 AM-2 PM) if you're flying into ITH/ROC/SYR, delays are likely and cancellations are possible given the onset of moderate/heavy snow and sleet.

TOMORROW AFTERNOON (2 PM-6 PM) snow/mixed precip will be tapering off to the west of Ithaca as drier air moves in aloft. If you're heading in from Buffalo or Ohio, you won't encounter much precipitation until you're into the Finger Lakes, but roads may still be slick. (See Image 6)

TOMORROW AFTERNOON (2 PM-6PM) heavy snow will be pivoting northeast of Ithaca, making travel very difficult if you're coming from NYC/CT/ALB/SYR. We strongly advise leaving as early as possible if you're travelling from these areas!

TOMORROW AFTERNOON (2 PM-6 PM) if you're flying into ITH/ROC/SYR, expect significant delays and/or cancellations as airport operations become heavily impacted by heavy snow. If you can make arrangements to get on an earlier flight, it would definitely be worth it!

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) We'll see a bit of a lull in precipitation during this time as the storm hops over the Appalachian mountains and redevelops in New Jersey. Expect light freezing rain/sleet to switch over to light snow here in Ithaca while heavy snow falls ALB-BOS (See Image 7).

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you're driving in from the west or south (Buffalo/OH/PA/NYC/etc.) you'll encounter only light precipitation, much of which will be rain or freezing rain until you get close to Ithaca. Roads may still be slick, but overall you should be OK.

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you're driving in from the north (ROC/SYR) you'll encounter light to moderate snow which will make roads slick but not impassible. If you're willing to go slow, you should be fine driving during this time.

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you're driving in from the east (ALB/BOS), you'll encounter very heavy snow and treacherous road conditions on I-90 and I-88. If it's at all possible, don't drive through here during this time! Snowfall rates will be >2"" per hour

TOMORROW EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) If you have a flight into ITH/ROC/SYR during this time, you'll likely encounter some delays, but planes should be able to land after they clear off the snow from earlier in the afternoon.

TOMORROW NIGHT (10 PM-4 AM) Bands of heavy snow will develop again over the Ithaca area as the storm strengthens near NYC. If you're not here by midnight, it's probably best to wait until later in the day on Monday. Snow could fall at rates of 1-2"" per hour. (See Image Eight)

MONDAY MORNING (4 AM-10 AM) bands of moderate to heavy snow will remain over the Ithaca area as the storm remains more or less stationary near Long Island. Travel from the east or southeast (ALB/BOS/NYC/CT) will be extremely difficult while conditions will improve to the west. (See Image 9)

MONDAY MORNING (4 AM-10 AM) if you're flying into ITH/ROC/SYR, expect significant delays and/or cancellations as heavy snow will be a challenge for airport crews to keep up with. If you can get on a flight tomorrow AM, that would be ideal but otherwise, your best bet is Tuesday

MONDAY MIDDAY/AFTERNOON (10 AM-6 PM) moderate snow will continue through the day on Monday from Ithaca east into New England. Travel from the west will improve, but roads east of Ithaca will remain treacherous as heavy snow continues to fall in eastern NY/New England. (See Image 10)

MONDAY EVENING (6 PM-10 PM) snow will taper off as NW winds bring drier air into the region and the storm moves into the Gulf of Maine. Roads will remain hazardous to the east of Ithaca, but you should be ok if you're heading in from Buffalo or points SW.
(See Image 11)

FINAL THOUGHTS - The earlier you can get here today/tomorrow morning, the better. Be ready to take it slow and expect delays no matter where you're coming from.

Concerns on Cornell Re-Opening Plans Fall 2020 

President Pollack and Provost Kotlikoff, 

We write, as a department, to express our concern about the recent decision to not provide quarantine housing, meals, and support to those students from the list of states identified on the NYS travel advisory list. We also have concerns with other aspects of the re-opening plan, which we outline below and for which we offer potential solutions. 

1. Providing quarantine housing, meals, and support was part of the original re-opening plan. The number of cases in the on-campus versus online model (the Frazier model) assumed that the arriving students from high-risk states would be quarantined and monitored to assure adherence. By no longer providing students with quarantine options and support, we can expect that some proportion of students will not quarantine effectively, resulting in an increase in the number of cases on campus and in the Ithaca community. Students will feel licensed to break the rules because they feel Cornell has violated its commitment to them to cover costs of quarantine. Thus, walking back the commitment of financial support during quarantine will contribute to lack of effective adherence due to both financial and psychological considerations. 

Some possible solutions: i) Ithaca College has asked all students from these states to remain at home until their states are removed from the list. This is a tough policy, but at least reduces the number of incoming cases based on known risk rates from high case states. ii) Another possible solution would be to provide quarantine support but bring students into campus in a staggered manner (thus allowing for quarantine capacity and waves of gateway testing). This would also mean that students could be taking online courses while in quarantine. This will provide students with an opportunity to be productive while in quarantine and greatly increase the chance of a successful start to the semester. It will also allow time for Cornell to make sure everyone is familiar with the testing system and social compact protocols. 

2. Provost Kotlikoff and VP Lombardi stated that the lack of guaranteed quarantine would affect only 1,300 students, because it impacts only students who would be living in dorms, and mostly freshmen. This assumes that students from the high-infection states who are living off campus will be able to come to Ithaca and quarantine in their apartments. We are concerned that this is not a reasonable assumption. Many students live with roommates, and some live with roommates that are from states both on/off the travel advisory list. Most of these students share bathrooms and living spaces, thus violating NYS quarantine rules. 

Some possible solutions: i) Cornell needs to provide more guidance for off- campus students as to how to effectively quarantine, and potentially provide 2 options for that student community as well. ii) These students will need help with meals, groceries, and transportation to testing. 

3. Very importantly, not providing quarantine housing, meals, and support will place an unfair economic burden on some students forcing them to make risky choices or face hardships. Students of lower socio-economic status, many of which are underrepresented or first- generation, will be disproportionately adversely affected by this policy. This policy is therefore blatantly anti-equity. Application for “hardship exemption” does not make this equitable because those students will need to justify themselves and jump through extra hoops. Many will feel that the odds are stacked against them, contributing to a sense of discrimination and/or hopelessness that harms both their relationship with the University and the collective interest in full and effective quarantining. 

Some possible solutions: i) Provide, by default, all students on financial aid with the hardship exemption, or prioritize those students without the need for application. This will reduce the stress associated with this hardship and speed up the process. ii) Provide support for students on financial aid that decide to stay in their home states, to assure they have the resources to complete online learning (including access to a personal computer and internet). 

4. As we come back together as a learning community it is important that we not only provide an academic experience but also look after our students’ mental health. Our students will be experiencing unprecedented stress and anxiety due to the effects of quarantine; the social pressures that may come from watching fellow students ignore the Behavioral Compact and social-distancing requirements; as well as possibly dealing with disease outbreaks, and deaths, on campus. Counseling services at Cornell have historically been barely adequate, at best. 

Some possible solutions: i) enhance online health services with a focus on mental health, ii) call on students to volunteer to get training in mental health counseling to serve as mental health ambassadors, be able to spread information about good mental health practices, and also importantly be able to detect signs of a student in distress, iii) create a campaign for mental health awareness at all levels of the Cornell community, provide signage, free online events, and classes. iv) Preemptively prepare counseling response teams to move into on-campus AND off- campus housing to offer both crisis counseling and guidance on appropriate responses when a student tests positive for COVID. We know there will be infections, hospitalizations, and likely deaths, thus the risk of eroding student confidence in their collective safety will be high if health counselors are absent when cases begin to emerge. 

5. The “Frazier Model” is based upon student surveys from months ago when the number of cases in the U.S. was decreasing and our confidence was increasing that we could contain the virus. This has changed, and will continue to change daily. Current national models predict that 11,000 people will die each week in the month of August in the U.S. The Cornell and Ithaca communities are very concerned with the influx of new cases, the transparency of data on new cases, and the lack of thresholds or specific criteria that would trigger actions such as a university lockdown or closure. 

Some possible solutions: i) the administration must be transparent about the number of cases and the results of testing, preferably with a frequently updated dashboard. Related to this is the degree and notification of contact tracing in the case of positive cases on campus. ii) conduct a follow up survey of the students that could include peer assessment questions to determine the extent to which students are worried about the conduct of other students. This would allow us to parameterize contact rates. Non-adherence to the behavioral compact is one of the variables that is most likely to alter the course of community disease and we believe that potential problems with student behavior could be corrected in part by providing them with real-time data connecting COVID patterns on campus with polls of student behavior and attitudes. Cornell should be prepared rather than reactive. iii) Our community needs clear criteria and parameters guiding decision-making for our response as cases increase in Ithaca. These criteria should be public.

Yes, the administration is doing serious mistakes with the move-in process, and the reactivation plan is still quite uncertain, even as we edge the beginning of the semester.

Yes, the country is dealing with this pandemic quite badly.

Yes, the impacts of this pandemic can often seem distant for demographies at low-risk like ours.

And yes, quaratine, social distancing, and precautionary measures can often imply difficult choices, tensions, and loneliness. Fear of missing out, and a fear of time lost.

However, that does ***not*** exempt you from personal responsibility in the actions you take.

,"You should know that residential life staff isn't being provided adequate support to do their jobs.

You should know that students **are** allowed into dorms even if they haven't tested (because many people are unable to find a testing spot in the schedule, which is NOT their fault + if they arrive after hours, they can't be tested).

You should also know that **people are breaking quarantine** across campus and, if we're not lucky, community spread will occur as a result. (We even have anecdotal evidence of this here on Reddit where people want to go out for toothpaste and food. Cornell should've done better and provided this for us)

You should know that people in quarantine have to share bathrooms in the dorms. And some of the staff have to share bathrooms with residents in quarantine. 

You should know that most of us (not all) will be taking most of our classes online across from a roommate who is also taking classes online, won't be able to really eat meals with friends in a group, and won't have many (if any) in-person activities.

You should know that at this moment there's no actual enforcement on the ground of the policies put forth by the university for quarantine.

You should know that res life staff are scared. For their own lives and for the health of the community.

lil_black_submarines,"If anything on this Reddit is to be taken at face value, it’s clear from the past couple weeks that this has been a very rough semester for us all. I’d like to brighten up the feed a little with some positivity for your Monday.

As we approach this break... please, PLEASE take care of yourself. Take this time to rest, relax, reset. Spend quality time with family and friends. Get as much sleep as your heavily deprived body can possibly handle. Don’t check your email for a day or two. Watch that show that’s been on your list for forever but you haven’t had time to start because you’ve had so much shit to do. Cuddle with some friends. Eat something sinfully unhealthy, and then eat some more of it. Go back for seconds, thirds at Thanksgiving dinner. Treat yourself to a shopping spree. Get a haircut, get new clothes, take a walk. DON’T let the misery and depression and anxiety and stress of this Godforsaken semester weigh on you during your time off. You DESERVE to be happy, and you deserve this break. We all do. We did it. We made it. 

When your life consists entirely of essays, problem sets, studying, all nighters, and exams... it’s quite easy to forget that that’s not ALL your life is. You matter to a lot of people, and the most important of those people is yourself. Take some you time, and come back ready to kick finals’ ass. You can do it. Though it always seems like you’re in competition with the rest of us here at Cornell, let’s see some collaboration. Let’s see some wholesome interactions. Let’s take care of each other. 

We made it. Take a deep breath and feel the light on your face. Congrats, you absolute badass. You did it.",TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF THIS BREAK. SERIOUSLY.,258,0.98,e1kw7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/e1kw7c/take_care_of_yourself_this_break_seriously/,17,1574737796.0,2019-11-25 21:09:56

We are by far the best shitposting sub in the Ivies, none even come close. Congrats guys, we're truly amazing.


With that being said, we need to make this sub even better. If Ivies get on us over anything we need a sub to rub in their face. That's why I propose this one secret doctors hate to make your sub bigger: upvote downvote icons that represent Cornell


Harvard and Yale both have them and we can't let them boast their prestige like that, we need to show them we're on equal playing field. I'm thinking the upvote can be the Cornell logo and the downvote can be the okenshield stir fry.

Pryde_and_Wisdom,"For context, I had spent the entire afternoon studying in Olin Library, took the bus back to North Campus, dropped off my stuff, then went to college town with a couple of friends to eat dinner.

I got back to my dorm around 9pm today (Saturday May 4th) and found my roommate passed out on the bed. Trying not to disturb him, I poked around the room trying to find my backpack in the dark, only my foot wasn't hitting anything. With alarms going off in my head, I flipped on the light switch and confirmed to my dread that there was no backpack on the floor of the room.

With all the adrenaline in the world, I sprinted from North Campus to Olin (taking a few fast walking breaks because running is tiring) to find my backpack. I entered the downstair's study area, praying to God that my backpack was still there. Unfortunately, it wasn't. I went to the library's main desk and asked if a backpack was found missing. I explained how the backpack had my initials on it, how my computer had my name and phone number on it, and how literally every single notebook for every single class I was taking had my name on it to identify the backpack as mine. As you can probably guess, there was no backpack in the lost and found.

I left the library and promptly yelled out ""FUCK"" in the middle of the A&S quad. I had lost all hope. I dejectingly walked down Libe Slope to wait for a bus to take me back to North. While waiting, a bus - the 92 bus - came from the opposite direction to take kids down to college town. Suddenly, light bulbs frantically lit up in my head because I had taken the 92 bus earlier that day. I went onto the bus and frantically searched for a backpack, and wouldn't you know, there was no backpack on the bus. I even asked the bus driver if there was anything reported missing, and she said I had to call the bus lost and found, which wouldn't even open until Monday.

At this point, I got off the bus near the Schwartz Center and was cursing myself to hell for being such an idiot. On my gloomy stroll back to North, I stopped off at WSH on the off chance my backpack was there. I hadn't gone to WSH at all that day, but you see, earlier on in the semester, my close friend had also lost his backpack. After a week of not finding it, his backpack mysteriously appeared in the main lobby of WSH. Unfortunately for me, he is a 1000x more lucky than me, or at least, I would have to wait at least a week for similar luck to occur for me. So, it was back to my depressing journey back to North Campus.

I got back to my dorm room feeling as if I was the most unfortunate person to have ever lived. Finals are coming up, paper deadlines are nearing, and I had neither notebooks to study nor a computer to write said papers. I drudgingly tore off my clothes and went into the shower to drown my miseries. As my luck this night would have it, I realized I was out of soap whilst in the middle of my shower. I got out of the disappointing lukewarm shower and threw myself onto my bed, ready to just fall asleep and have the night end with some hope that I would wake up and realize my misfortunate was but a dream. Funnily enough, I didn't land on my pillow; rather, I face planted onto something hard and uneven. ""No, it can't be,"" I thought. But it was. I face planted right onto my backpack. ""HOLY SHIT!!!"" was the exact phrase that left my mouth. Apparently, my roommate had came back drunk earlier in the day, tripped on my backpack, and proceeded to throw the bag onto my bed. My bed was so messy that the backpack just got hidden under the blankets. Truly, I'm still in disbelief.

TL;DR I lost my backpack, and after a frantic search, found said backpack waiting for me on my bed.",Fun Times at Cornell,258,0.98,bktfvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/bktfvb/fun_times_at_cornell/,10,1557056572.0,2019-05-05 06:42:52

Walker_M_White,"I know that some incoming students read this Reddit, so I just wanted to post information about CS 1110 and how it is going to change to match the realities of the fall semester.

When the course modalities goes live you will see that it is technically a hybrid class.  While lecture will be fully online (more on that in a second), there are a few in-person sections. However, there are a lot less of these than I asked for (I have staff willing to manage more), because of issues with space on campus.  The ones that we did get will be in a large computer lab and limited to 15 people.  These sections exist largely for equity reasons -- they are for the people who do not have a computer capable of doing work in the course.  So I ask that you hold off grabbing these sections unless you really need them.

As for the course itself, sections are now twice a week instead of the historical once a week.  This is because, even in online, your section will be the primary way that you contact staff and get help.  Yes, there are still open consulting hours.  But it helps in a class this large for someone to know who you are; that is easier in sections.  There is NO extra work for this extra section.  We are just spreading out the traditional work in this course over two days to make it easier to finish work during class time as opposed to using outside, after office hours help.

My lectures, unfortunately, will be recorded and posted online.  They will be YouTube style, in small bites, and asynchronous.  We will have a scheduled, synchronous lecture time, however.  This will be a completely optional time (no attendance will be taken), as I am aware of how unfair it is to abuse the online format to ask you to do more work. During this time, I will answer all questions and do demos like a performing monkey.  Think of it as a flipped classroom where I do all the work.  

Instead of the three exams, there will be only two (how we administer them to limit cheating is still being worked on).  The brand new A7 I wrote this summer will replace the final exam.  This means that the final project has to be done alone -- not in pairs.  And it is designed with the expectation that not everyone completes it (but if everyone does complete it, there is no curve that will penalize you). You will also have more time -- well into ""finals"" week to complete it.

If you have any other questions about the course for the Fall, post them and I will answer.",CS1110 Modalities for Fall,251,1.0,i50gww,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/i50gww/cs1110_modalities_for_fall/,36,1596777511.0,2020-08-07 00:18:31

pearlgirl93,"Let me start by saying that I truly feel bad for the quarantine state students that were promised 2 week hotel stays and are now on their own.  It's a totally crappy situation.

I am playing devil's advocate as a downstate New Yorker.  New York was in a BAD way this spring.  I am very blessed that my parents were able to work from home and no one in my immediate family got sick.  I know it made national news, but I'm telling you, it was surreal to turn on your local news everyday and see crying reporters standing outside hospitals talking to crying healthcare workers about how dire the situation is.  Seeing lines of ambulances blocks long waiting to bring people to the hospital. Having them report from outside refrigerated morgue trucks, showing what the inside of an empty one looks like and how much capacity it has.  Interviewing people who lost multiple family members to covid.  Seeing the USNS Comfort hospital ship, the Javits Center turn into a hospital and tent field hospitals set up in Central Park that looked like something out of the Civil War.   

New York was able to bend the curve by a lockdown and then strict phased re-openings that focused on the numbers of positive cases in a particular area.  This along with strict mask requirements and social distancing has put us where we are as of today, with a 1% positivity rate statewide, out of the tens of thousands tested each day.  I guess what I am saying is NY deserves to protect itself from an influx of people from states that have covid positivity rates of 20% or higher.

It was super distracting and honestly I think I did worse than I wanted on the exam because of it. I tried raising my hand pretending I had a question about the prelim so that a TA would come and see him and get him to stop but when the TA came he kept going and the TA didn't see anything :(

No, I mean students who are saying “the University doesn’t give a fuck about us” and are making petitions and such. But seriously... what was the alternative? I know of four different people who were in NYC and the Bronx this weekend. People plan on taking advantage of Spring Break ticket prices. That is exactly how you catch the virus. 

There is more to Cornell than just healthy students. There are older faculty members and staff, and the surrounding Ithaca area. There are children whose parents work their minimum wage jobs at Nasties and then come home to them. There are immunocompromised students who can literally die. Our presence is literally putting all of those people at risk. 

A lot of people have valid complaints about having to go home to an at risk area or not being able to do work because not everyone has access to wifi.

That's all l'll say on that front as I don't feel informed enough to say more.

What I want to discuss is the reaction of some of the members to the backlash. I cannot speak for all black people, and as such will not. I personally do not feel comfortable with people who do not share my skin color making broad character assassinations on people they know nothing about for the sake of 'me.' I do not feel oppressed by people having issues with the donation, and people painting all dissenters as anti-black in my eyes is insane. Many SA members seem to have a ""you ain't black"" Biden level entitlement to their donation which has been disgusting to read. It gives off such a strong vibe of white-saviorism, and it's clear they care more about clearing their names and starting more fires than fostering a productive discussion on race relations in Cornell, something we should've and could've done given this national attention.

We’re so lucky that we’ve been given this opportunity to maybe still have a college experience this semester, and it’s been really frustrating to see exclusively negativity online. The system has many flaws, sure, but I for one am extremely thankful to be here in the first place.

ithacuncanny,"Regardless of whether you think Cornell is reopening just for the money, it's important to remember that returning is totally voluntary. Cornell did a great job, like Harvard, it allowed students to stay completely online and not risk their health. It also gave everyone the option to return, which not many other institutions have. The only possible way I could have seen them handling this better is with decreased tuition, which Harvard/Princeton/others have shown isn't too realistic, especially considering endowment size. Why complain?

TL;DR: Cornell's reactivation plan went above and beyond. If you don't think their in-person measures are enough, then you are under 0 obligation to go back for Cornell-specific reasons (leases are not the fault of this specific handling). If you want to go back, great.

randomUser6472,"Hey Cornell, I wanted to share a story, while very hard to read at parts, that hopefully will help spread awareness on depression and suicide awareness. For personal reasons, i ask you please do not ask who I am, and if you do know who I am PLEASE DO NOT SHARE MY IDENTITY WITH ANYONE.  I also ask that you read the post in its entirety. 

Last year I came to Cornell as a freshman and was in a very bad spot within a week of being on campus. My whole life I was bullied until HS, but in HS I got a really great friend group, started dating girls, and life was pretty great. When I went to college I was so afraid things would go back to the place where they were before HS. 

As the first month and a half went by of school, I felt so lost. Even though I would go out every weekend, and put on a happy face, the truth was that I was depressed. Those that knew me well at school knew the pain I was facing every day. Then came one day in October that still is a little bit of a blur to me. 

It was a night I was at the library thinking about life and how useless it had become, how tired I was of not being able to sleep at night because of troublesome dreams of loneliness and heartbreak, how I had become so accustomed to pain over the past two months. So when I get back to dorm, I wanted to get my mind off of my pain, just for a second. So i grabbed a pair of scissors from my desk, went to the bathroom stall, and proceeded to press them against my wrist and slice once, and then a second time much harder. In that moment, I wanted to let the pain go, to just be okay for a second. 

Thankfully, so thankfully, i found the courage to stop and proceeded to return to my room where I had a panic attack and my amazing roommate thankfully took care of me. I remember the next week walking on campus with rubber bands around my wrist and a watch a loved one gave me, trying to cover up the scabbing and praying no one would notice. Every single time I moved my hand I thought people were staring at me, judging me. 

Over time, I did get better, with many nights of crying, the amazing friends I had at school, and much self-care. It was not easy, but every single time I look down at my wrist, I see two faint scars, now all but faded, and remember where I was and where I am now. These scars remind me of the strength I had that night to stop, the strength I had the next day to tell my best friend asking for help, the strength that still lives in me today to face the issues that arise. 

I am telling you this story for two reasons. The first is because if you knew me you would probably not notice the depression I faced. I am very social, I am usually very cheerful and happy, go out a lot with friends, but there was a time where I felt true pain. Those small ""how are you"" or ""I love you"" text from friends and family made all the difference on my road to recovery. So take time this week, this month, especially with everything going on, to send a heartfelt message to a loved one, it might just save their life. Even if you don't think they need it, they might need it more than anyone else. 

The second reason is to say that, everyone out there hiding their pain and feeling alone, please please please speak up. Ik especially as a guy, a lot of us are encouraged to hide pain, but screw that. Being depressed or crying doesn't make you any less of a man. Finding the strength to confront and overcome these issues makes you so so strong. So if you need help please talk to a friend, a family member, and/or a medical health professional. THERE IS SOMEONE OUT THERE FOR YOU. SOMEONES LIFE IS BETTER WITH YOU IN IT.

ds143,"Alum here \~6 yrs out. I got a 3.9 and worked my butt off. Like, literally made myself sick studying. In retrospect, nobody in the real world cared. If I could go back, I'd get a far lower GPA and socialize more, have more fun and not spend my weekends reading textbooks and doing problem sets making myself miserable.

**I realize that exempting med/law/finance folks is a huge caveat. Sorry.** So to anyone but those folks: it’s perfectly OK to just do “good”.  In retrospect, I’d trade my 3.9 for somewhere between 3.0-3.5 if it meant my 4 years at Cornell were less unbearably stressful.

I thought college grades correlated with success after college as much as high school grades correlated with the  college you got into. That was wrong. High school grades matter to obsess over, and you won, you got into Cornell. 

College grades? if you don't fall into one of those categories I listed, it's less important. I'm not saying do poorly, but find the point on the ""quality of life"" vs. ""GPA outcome"" spectrum you're OK with.

Bambo222,"Dear Cornellians,

While we are all locked up during this pandemic, I thought I would write a reflective letter to my past self, when I was a Senior at Cornell almost 10 years ago. It is entitled “What I Wish I Knew At Cornell”. It ended up a bit long, but might be useful to someone (or, something you disagree with!).

Cheers,

Cornell Alum

\---

**1. Find work that you enjoy.**

Work is where you are paid to solve someone else’s problem (e.g. customers, boss, investors). School is a contrived microcosm; GPA (including Ivy League pedigree) does not matter in the long run. It may only help you get an interview for your first few jobs (and I will assume that you are smart if you went to Cornell). However, I mostly care about your ability to solve a problem (quickly) that I am paying you to solve.

Thus, passion and academic intelligence are only useful insofar as it helps you solve real, external problems. The best problems are unsolved, which means the answer is not in a textbook but may require foundational ideas from textbooks. I mistakenly thought passion and academic intelligence were sufficient to get a great first job; they were not. You need to show a company why you are useful to them, for a particular role, to solve a particular problem. Passion is good, but it is individual and personal; it is what motivates you. The world does not care about your passion if it is devoid of work utility.

Ask yourself, if I paid you $100K a year, what can you do for me? Think of a job as a matrix; the columns are industry verticals (e.g. energy, health, technology, financial services) and the rows are job functions (e.g. marketing, sales, legal, engineering, product, finance, operations). Where do you want to position yourself? A finance guy in a technology company is not as important as a finance guy in a financial services company. Think carefully about your ideal industry vertical and role.

Fortunately, for many of you, Doctors, Lawyers, Bankers, and Consultants have linear career paths which may explain why hoop-jumpers are attracted to them (I was a short-lived former consultant), as they are modeled after university admissions. Be careful; make sure you truly enjoy what you spend 8-10 hours a day doing; do not be a slave to your parents expectations or peer prestige.

If you don't know what kind of work you enjoy, you must explore what that is every day of every year until you figure that out. It is unlikely that you do at this stage in your life; but you should know by the time you are 30 years old. Do not become one of my countless peers who lamented on wasted years during my last Cornell Reunion, despite having the prestigious ‘consulting’ or ‘finance’ job when we were Seniors. Tick tock.

**2. Get really good at work you enjoy.**

This one logically follows from (1). The most valuable things are hard because they are not solved yet. Commit to getting good at what you enjoy, and commit to sucking at whatever you do for a while \*before\* you get good at it.

The 10,000-Hour Rule is a useful lens. It suggests that the key to achieving 'world-class' expertise in any skill is a matter of practicing the correct way for a total of around 10,000 hours - of which you will suck for the first 3,000 hours. A career lifetime consists of about around 80,000 hours (a single full-time work year is \~2000 hours), so you have plenty of time to experiment in your 20s. In my case, I made a  hard pivot in my mid-20s and sucked for a few years, spending nights/weekends on that pivot, but managed to become so good at what I liked I now get paid well for it and have my pick of jobs. I made the switch after 4,000 hours and am still growing.

**3. Pick a wave to surf.**

The world is a little meritocratic, but most of your success will depend on how well you position yourself within a larger macroeconomic trend. You want to create value and capture a large slice of that value. When the pie is growing faster than the people competing for that pie, your company, and in turn your career, will grow.

As a trivial example, joining Kodak as ""Super Awesome Job Title"" in 2007 would have been a terrible idea. Even if you were promised a fast-track to a promotion, executive visibility, good compensation, and a fancy desk, it wouldn't matter. Mobile phones would soon supplant the personal camera industries purpose for existence. You had better hope your skills would transfer to a role in the mobile world, or you had better be creative in finding adjacent growing industries. Indeed, I know someone who moved from Kodak's projection business to Virtual Reality at Facebook because, as a hardware optics engineer, the physics were similar. His peers who could not find another wave to surf were fired.

**4. Join a rocket ship (or 'speed boat').**

Assuming you picked a growing macroeconomic wave to take your career board and surf, you need to find the best company to join. Paddle over and beg to hop onto the fastest boat, so to speak. This would have been Google when most people still used Yahoo (or better yet, AltaVista); the wave was the exponentially increasing amount of information on the internet coupled with exponentially decreasing costs of personal computing devices that could easily connect to and generate content for said internet. These macro-trends are obvious in retrospect but can be difficult to identify. Finding medium-sized but very fast-growing companies is the most probable thing you should be targeting, as they are established (lower risk and validated customer value) but still rapidly growing.

Unfortunately, that is why I think nonprofits/NGOs suck early in your career. Join an NGO \*after\* you achieve seniority in a particular domain, then take a pay cut and give back as a senior director at an NGO. Otherwise, if you join as a low level employee, you will hit a ceiling and learn in a resource constrained environment.

If you opt for a conventional career path (e.g. Lawyer, Banker, Consultant, Doctor), then continue jumping through those linear hoops. Positioning is still important; but success is about out-achieving your immediate peers for a fixed or slowly growing number of slots. Unsurprisingly, academic prestige matters most in these fields because it positions you to be in front of the hiring line. If there are a fixed set of open jobs among candidates who all know the same things who all followed a similar path, why wouldn't you take the top 5% of the class or Harvard graduate first?

**5. Be close to the money.**

In finance, they call it ""the Front Office"". You don't need to be a Wolf of Wall Street Bro, but you should be in The Front Office of whatever your company is. Your job needs to be close to what makes money because your impact will be more easily measurable. Jobs within companies are very unequal, despite having similar lifestyles and dressing the same. This rule of thumb will make it harder to replace you over time and you are more likely to make a lot more money more quickly than your peers.

For example, in Silicon Valley the software engineers and product managers are in the front office. Working in finance at Apple or Facebook isn’t that important. Building the next product is. Conversely, being a software engineer at Goldman Sachs is a terrible idea (perhaps, unless you are a Quant trader and directly make them a lot of money). You want to own the client relationship or buy and sell things on Wall Street. If you're a management consultant and not on-site, that's a bad idea too. You need to own the client relationship - particular senior client individuals are paying for your expensive project. If you're only a body to throw at a problem, you're replaceable and lack leverage.

Even if you work at a non-profit, this logic applies. Which role(s) (e.g. program delivery, fundraising, marketing, operations, evaluation, web development, administration) are  'close to the money' (closest to the value someone is paying you for)? I would pick program delivery (delivering results) and fundraising (talking to donors). In some sense, Private Equity isn't much different. The person who fundraises from rich donors or sources new deals is more valuable than the low-level Analyst crunching excel per deal. Thus, it makes sense why Managing Directors at PE firms or Goldman Sachs don't touch excel; excel is merely a stepping stone to this 'end game' for AEM majors.

**6. Solve critical problems (and make your boss look good).**

Solve the most important problems, even if it’s not sexy. What you want to do may not be what leadership wants you to do. Unfortunately, even if what you want to do is ""right"" in the long run, you need to do what your boss wants. Convince them later. If that means doing some shit work for a little while to get something done you need to do it, and fast. The most interesting or sexiest problem may not be the most business critical thing that needs to get done.

When you do have to do frustratingly mind-numbingly boring things, try to automate it the next time or try to make it more fun. If this is all you do, some process is broken and you should convince your boss that this needs to be fixed and propose fixing it. If shit work is all they want you to do, see #8.

**7. Stay curious and indulge your interests.**

No one is born with a map that outlines a plan for their life (unless your parents have forced theirs upon you). What use is a map if the world is always changing? Instead, you need to find a compass. I think curiosity will be your best north star. Make time to be self-indulgent in things that you are eager to discover, or that excite your imagination. Do it, even if you suck. This will ensure you always do (1) work that you enjoy and (2) stay good at it over the long run. Which leads to the next point...

**8. Know when to stick, and when to quit (then go to #3).**

We don't talk about strategic quitting nearly enough. The world is always changing, and so will your interests. If something doesn't feel right, and you know it's not right, have the courage to strategically quit. This is not giving up because something worth doing is too hard; strategic quitting is being selective in investing your time in things that will give you the most reward. Go read Seth Godin's book ""The Dip"".

**9. Set limits.**

You are more than just your job. One day your career triumphs and failures will all be but a distant memory. Strong organizations move on without you by hiring a new person. Set limits on what you are willing to compromise and what you are not. If your commute is dragging you down, figure out a way to move or quit. If a new promotion requires far more travel than your family wants, don't take it. Do you have enough time to pursue your hobbies or see old friends?

**10. Invest in your friends and family.**

It becomes increasingly harder to make time for people as you get older. Everyone gets busy; if you're free they need to be free too. It can be harder to make many new friends in new cities, especially if you're an Ambitious Overachiever who is likely to rotate through a few major cities for new career opportunities. Indeed, I have spent considerable time moving between three major cities in the USA in just the past 6 years.

Therefore, you need to be proactive. Maybe you have a friend who is a ""starter"" and can hop on their social bandwagon. But more likely, you need to own and actively build your community. Plan for a year or experimenting with different social activities to find your crew. Most people are waiting to be invited somewhere. Everyone wants to feel included. Be a leader, and make things happen.

**Conclusion.**

If you follow that recipe, there's a high likelihood you'll have a rewarding, successful, and enjoyable career. You'll feel happy, your friends and family will be happy because you'll be happy, and you'll continue to get better at your thing.

There is no perfect job. If you're successful, you'll have your pick amongst a lot of good choices in different ways. There won't be a ""best"" career choice. Only best, with respect to your values and current situation at the time of the decision.

Think about your job as a long and nonlinear career arc. You need to be deliberate and intentional with your time. Your goal should be to shift your work away from tasks you dislike or are bad at, and towards tasks you enjoy and are good at.

You might not know what you enjoy and are good at yet, but you probably already know what you don't enjoy or are bad at. That's normal. You need to explore more to discover what things excite you. You'll know when your natural curiosity takes over and the task at hand doesn't feel like a chore.

Don't be a dreamer who doesn't execute. For example, I have a friend who is unenthusiastic about her marketing career but can't decide if she wants to be a journalist or get a PhD in Psychology. She's 30. She's dreamt about these things for 10 years. Instead of spending Sunday afternoons writing articles or reading psychology, she watches Netflix and makes excuses. At this rate, she'll wonder if she made the right choice at 40, and 50, and 60.

Think about exploring your interests like going to the gym. You might need to work your way up to going, but after you get started it begins to feel good.

Stay safe and healthy everyone. This pandemic sucks, but it soon shall pass. The next decade of your life will be exciting and filled with many ambiguous choices. Everything will eventually work out if you maintain the right mindset when navigating this next chapter of your life.",Career Advice: A Letter To My Younger Self,219,0.97,fxz5jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/fxz5jx/career_advice_a_letter_to_my_younger_self/,11,1586490114.0,2020-04-09 22:41:54

roselia4812,"Not a creature was stirring, not even a CS major;

The books were packed in the backpack with care,

In hopes that freedom soon would be there;

Premed students were nestled all snug in their beds;

While visions of As on their prelims danced in their heads;

And hotelies in their leisure, and engineers in their depression,

Had just settled our brains for a long turkey session,

When out on the gorges there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I dropped like my grades,

Saw crap under the shutters and left the shit for my imaginary maids.

The moon on the construction of the new-fallen snow,

Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,

When what to my wondering eyes did appear,

But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,

With a little old driver so lively and alive,

I knew in a moment he must be David Gries.

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

""Now, A+! now, A! now A- and B+!

On, B! on, B-! on, C and C+!

To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!

Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""

As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,

When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;

So up to the dormtop the TAs they flew

With the sleigh full of toys, and David Gries too—

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the fly

The prancing and pawing of each little sigj.

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

Down the chimney David Gries came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,

And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;

A bundle of prelims and psets he had flung on his back,

And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.

His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!

His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!

His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,

And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,

And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;

He had a broad face and a little round belly

That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.

He was chubby yet hot, an alt-right jolly old elf,

And I fawned when I saw him, in spite of myself;

A wink of his eye and a twist of his head

Soon gave me to know I had something to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,

And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,

And laying his finger aside of his nose,

And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,

And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—

We have to wear masks whenever not in our rooms, we can’t eat together, and now we’re being told we’re breaking the behavioral compact by having more than 10 people living in our chapters.

Cornell already has a very effective prevention process against partying by pretty much kicking off any deviant house without an appeal process.

Kramyehcski,"I am a senior. For a background I switched majors and I still have a lot of requirements for my concentration  and college ones including humanities in CALS. This is my last fall so gotta keep catching up.

First round I got waitlisted for classes (2 different ones that count for the same thing, both online only) I need for my concentration. Okay I’ll pick my other in-person classes and get on the waitlist for my concentration classes. Good sorta, but still nervous for the rest of my shopping cart and looking at backup plans.

Today I have my shopping cart with the rest of my schedule needed. I couldn’t get into a backup backup concentration class (online only), I couldn’t get into the humanity I was planning on taking (also online only). I scrambled to find a plan D set of courses and I just broke down crying. This is insane. I’m a senior and all these classes left I need are completely online and full! And they are online!!!

This 6-credit cap first round completely screwed me over! If the justification of the rounds was to allow underclassmen into in-person courses why didn’t they let the first round only be for in-person classes?!? I’ve already emailed my advisor, I’ve emailed the professors and basically I was told they might have space for me to get off the waitlist but they don’t know until sept 4. I guess I’ll keep looking to fill my empty schedule spots as the waitlist isn’t a guarantee. This is absolutely absurd, this is the stuff I had to deal with as a freshman why am I doing it again as a senior?! I don’t have another fall semester for some fall only classes! I can’t just choose some credits I need most of my classes!

On top of that, hearing that freshmen got to enroll in 9 credits due to the error with FWS angers me more as they got more of their schedule filled-in and confirmed more than me as a senior (I understand I won’t need an FWS and there are no conflicts there, it’s the credit count that upsets me more).

wafflemustard,"It was already plated when we got to the classroom, each desk beautifully adorned by a tantalizing fillet mignon. To the left of each delicious paper plate, an elegantly folded paper napkin supported a plastic fork and a real steak knife. While I was a little disappointed by the disposable place settings, I was surprised he had even managed to afford this much. To this day, I remain unsure how much of the event was paid for by his department budget versus his own salary, but the look on Mr. P’s face told me that it wasn’t important. With bated breath, he waited for us to react. All he wanted was to do something for us that we would enjoy and appreciate. The man really cared.

For a moment there was only stunned silence. It felt like the calm before the storm. Someone was going to make a noise, and then the cheering would start.

Any second now.

“Really Mr. P? Steak?”

It was that girl that sat two seats behind me.

“You’re gonna make us all take time out of class to eat and you can’t even be bothered to provide some goddamn chicken?”

“Yeah!” another classmate chimed in. “And what the hell is this timing? I brought lunch today, but if you cared about me you would have known that I buy lunch on Wednesdays! You’re making me waste money!”

They did have a point. The whole class joined in complaining. How dare he.

The look on Mr. P’s face was painful. I don’t know if there is an age at which watching a man’s soul exit his body is appropriate, but at 16, I was certainly not prepared. For the rest of the year, he was a mere shell of his former self, pushing through the monotony of teaching only because his broken mind couldn’t think of anything else to do.

He also said he's gonna be holding parties in our dorm room which I'm very apprehensive about.

Well I don't know about y'all but I'm concerned about having long term lung damage from coronavirus, not just the mortality rate ([https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53356593](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-53356593)).

Is there some way to switch roommates at this point? I really want to attend my first semester in person but with this risk of a roommate I'm not sure if it's worth it.

sweatystartup,"Nick Huber here - 2012 alum and Storage Squad founder. My heart goes out to all of you. I met my wife in April of senior year. It brings a tear to my eye when I think about how much this has changed your world.

Cornell made a deal with us at about 7pm today to offer free storage for on campus students. We'll be **delivering free boxes tomorrow out of RPCC and William Keeton Office starting at about 11am**. We'll be at those two locations all week so students can come get supplies. There is a 4 box limit for collection tomorrow until a big shipment of boxes gets in on Monday night. This is not a storage limit but a packing supply limit because there is a shortage. 

**Students will pack up, label their stuff, and leave it in the dorms.** We'll come back in April to pick everything up.

I'm honored to serve you all during this incredibly difficult time. If you'd like to get involved we pay $15 per hour + tips. We have been working 20 hours a day to assemble a team and we still need help servicing the off campus housing folks.

This opportunity will likely save my company and my home as we lost all of our business at most of our other markets.

Cornell has amazing leadership and other schools are not offering this. They are really stepping up to the plate when it matters. 

We'll all come out of this stronger than ever. GO BIG RED.

spikeleemyspiritanim,"Someone just posted here about feeling depressed and seemed to be suicidal. By the time I finished typing my response it seemed they had deleted their post and their account. In case they are still browsing here, I figured I'd post the response so they can still get the message (and I guess it could be helpful to others as well).

If this type of post isn't allowed, sorry! Also, if you think I missed anything or said anything wrong feel free to correct it.



Hey, I'm sorry you're feeling the way you do. Cornell can definitely provide an environment that for many people amplifies or in some cases creates sources of stress that leads to depression and anxiety and more. I'm not a mental health professional so I may not be able to offer the most help, and I'd say most people agree that just telling people ""it gets better!"" is demeaning and futile, so I'll refrain. That being said, I'd say you aren't alone in how you feel, even when you think you are. I know that sounds paradoxical and probably isn't helpful, but I think it's important to be reminded.

It would seem from your description that your friends and family don't know about your situation, which is okay for now. Some people don't like to tell the people around them how they're feeling inside and need the time to come around to even begin considering opening up to someone. If you have a friend or family member that you think would understand, you might find it useful to open up to them and tell them how you feel. It's easier said than done and can be daunting, but remember that you do get to control how much you tell them all at once. It seems from what you say that these people probably care about you, and I'm sure they'd want to know if that is the case. But again, at your own pace.

Your final statement suggests you're feeling suicidal. There's no shame in that, it can happen to anyone. It would, however, benefit you to seek some sort of help. Perhaps not at first as it can be a very long curve to starting to feel more like yourself. Like I said, suicidal thoughts aren't shameful but it is definitely the sort of thing you'd want to take very seriously and try to get some aid. I'm not going to assume you have any one sort of path to seek out, such as the ability to pay for a doctor / CAPS, or the strength to go yet (it can be difficult for some). That said, I will leave some resources here for you. Even if you don't want to seek professional help just yet, there are things you can try. My inbox is open whenever you want to speak with someone anonymously is also open.

607-255-5155 You can use this number to contact Cornell health at any time, and for urgent concerns.

[General information regarding CAPS](https://health.cornell.edu/services/counseling-psychiatry)

In the event that you can't pay for or don't want to wait for a CAPS appointment, you can attend [Let's Talk Drop-In Counseling hours](https://health.cornell.edu/services/counseling-psychiatry/lets-talk) staffed by various mental health professionals in an informal setting. No appointment necessary, just walk in and talk Monday to Friday.

[Mental Health Association in Tompkins County](http://mhaedu.org/) I don't know all that much about the organization, but I've heard they really care and I've met Jacob who works there and is incredible. They have some of their own resources.

National Suicide Prevention Hotline 24/7 1-800-273-8255 
[NSPH Website](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) On the website, they've also got a chat ability.

Of course, as above, my inbox on here is always open as well. I'm not the most knowledgeable so perhaps someone else can suggest some more resources/thoughts. I would also say that, if you do start counseling, you may need to try a few doctors before you find the one you feel comfortable with. That is completely okay! Don't feel like it's useless because you couldn't work with the first counselor you get.

You may not feel like it, but you've made some progress by posting here. In a way, it is your (I assume) first attempt to reach out and open up. That can be a difficult process and you've started overcoming that first obstacle!

I wish you the best, and want to reiterate you aren't alone or hopeless. My inbox is open.","Re: ""Depressed"" post",206,0.96,8bw98y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/8bw98y/re_depressed_post/,8,1523619515.0,2018-04-13 06:38:35

altruyzm,"This isn't really a problem for anyone outside my suite, but there's this one guy who keeps pooping in the shower in the morning. I get peeing in the shower since it just runs down, but most of the poop still stays on the ground and it just stinks up the whole place. I wear flip-flops when I shower but it still grosses me out when I see streaks of brown on the walls and visible lumps of poop on the floor.

We've tried confronting the guy and he says that everyone in his family does it and we're all a bunch of ""pussies for not being able to deal with a little poop."" I don't think this is a normal thing, and everyone else in the suite agrees. What steps can we take to get him to stop?

Edit: This is actually getting ridiculous. I accidentally left my shampoo in the shower last night and he shat all over it this morning. Not sure what I'm gonna do now.

throw_awayfrommebaby,"Hey guys! I can totally see why online classes would be a drag for some people. So, I've consolidated some of my tips for making the experience more enjoyable, and taking advantage of the situation. Some of these will be very specific, and may not be applicable to everyone. But hopefully, something here will resonate with you :)


How to hate having online classes a little bit less, hopefully:


• Ambiance and Aesthetic^TM. 


I'm the type of person where I need to have a *vibe*. Not for other people, but for myself. I wanted how I looked and what I did to resonate with how I felt. In person, this meant my outfits were always on point, my makeup flawless, and my notes on darkmode-- because these things made me feel better about myself, and made interacting with my work more fun! How has this energy manifested in Zoom World? 

▪ I still take care with how I dress. To me, it gets me in a specific mindset: ""I am dressed like a bad bitch. I am a bad bitch. And I can take on whatever bullshit this school throws at me."" Also, putting together outfits is just *fun* for me, even if no one else sees it. It reminds me that yes, I *can* look good, and boosts my confidence.


▪ my icon is tight as fuck. it's a digital drawing of a snap of myself, with ~artistic liberty~. So, when beneficial and allowed, I can always throw up my icon instead of my camera. I will talk more about this later >:)


▪ my space. I live in an apartment by myself, so I have full fucking freedom to decorate the space however I want (within the landlord's constraints). As a person who *loves* DIYs, I take *full* advantage of this. Creative solutions to small inconveniences is like liquid crack to me. Desk cluttered? Put up a shelf with what you have on hand! I literally used cardboard, and it gets the job done. Need room for something? Exercise your spatial visualization skills, and optimize the way you store things! The point is to *make the space yours, and conducive to your learning.* I am the type of person where I *cannot* focus if I'm surrounded by mess-- so I keep my place clean. If that's not you, then *dont worry about it!* Figure out what works for you, and what you can do to make your space more like that.


• Habits/ ""things you can get away with on Zoom that you probably cant in person""

▪Oh boy, this one is going to be fun.


▪ if you're anything like me, you *cannot* just sit and focus on a lecture for 50+ minutes straight. I have to be *doing* something. Whether that's dicking around with my notes, using my fidget cube, or redoing my hair, my hands *cannot* be just writing things down. In person, this was a deficit. On Zoom? I am fucking *prospering*. 


I can work on my side projects while attending lecture, and no one is the wiser. I can clean my room, write up a schedule, plan out a structure, mix a fancy drink, and *no one is going to give me shit.* My hands can be occupied as my attention is focused on whatever the professor is saying, and I can make progress on multiple things at once. It is God damn liberating.


If I want to do something that requires me to leave my position at the computer, I just throw up my icon and put on my speakers. And if something the professor says requires more of my attention, I stop what I'm doing and return. Its awesome.


▪ Music, music, music!! I fucking *love* playing music in a second tab at a lower volume as the professor speaks!! It makes it so much easier to focus!! I usually use something without lyrics, but upbeat, so my energy and mood stay up. This is typically lofi beats, gaming soundtracks, or classical music. Do you know how satisfying it is to listen to ocean themed lofi as Bruce Monger talks about tides? I do. Its fucking awesome.


▪ *Food*. Whether my camera is on or off, it does not matter. I *will* eat an entire Hawaiian pizza and side of chicken nuggets as Dr. Ritz balances forces in the j direction. Because the class is around lunchtime, I spend my morning working out like an animal, and I get *hungry as fuck*. Of course, if anyone ever asked me to stop, I would. But no one has so far, so >:)


▪ What, do you think I just *sit* in front of my computer? I am affronted. Why sit, when you can *lounge?* when you can *lay down*? When you can *stand up and move around?* Experiment, and see what works for you, but dont assume you have to just sit because that's what you would have done in person.


I'm sure theres more I'm not thinking of right now, but I hope at least some of this was beneficial? And made Zoom University suck a little bit less? If you have advice, feel free to drop a comment :) good luck, godspeed.",Ways in which I make online classes more bearable,197,0.97,izkrdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/izkrdg/ways_in_which_i_make_online_classes_more_bearable/,21,1601074033.0,2020-09-25 17:47:13

Situ_Biotech,"With the social distancing procedures, the Cornell Store has said,

> ***All  textbooks purchased through The Cornell Store must be pre-ordered  online and either scheduled for curbside or store pickup or shipped.***  Students should be prepared to begin pre-ordering course materials  online as soon as courses open for enrollment. We will reach out with  additional information about how to order textbooks and course materials  in the coming weeks.  

With some exceptions, buying textbooks from the Cornell Store is a scam. You're often paying full price for a book you may or may not read for 3 months. Worse, the Cornell Store is asking you to buy a textbook *before you've started taking the class*. Don't waste your money this semester by pre-ordering textbooks.

sagaciousfalconer,"I woke up greeted by a white light emanating from my window, the glistening snow offering promise of snow angels and folly, beckoning me to go outside. As I open the door and exit my dorm, swirls of white powder bite my face and my hands. As hordes of freshmen struggle their way through the Balch Courtyard, I realize that my imagination and prospects of frolicking in the snow had been deeply misguided.  I take a deep breath and, as my face slowly numbs over, reluctantly join this Great North migration.

I may have not known who was walking besides me this morning, but when we trudged downhill side by side together, persisting through the great Ithaca winds, we all became brothers and sisters in arms. I slip down some frozen ice and hurt my knee, but a woman pulls me up and helps me continue on this arduous, perilous, tortuous journey. I can no longer see the horizon. The edges of Rockefeller hall are no longer well defined. Am I fainting? Is this it for me? Am I really willing to put myself through this for a physics lecture?

As I draw closer and closer to my destination, I notice more and more people walking the opposite direction as I. Are they coming back from class or from battle? A holy messenger in the form of a 20-year old student yells, ""Classes are cancelled! Classes are cancelled! Classes are cancelled!"" Do I trust this man and return home to the sweet comforts of my bed and the gentle heat of my dorm? Or do I march onwards? How do you know if you are listening to the horn of Gabriel or witnessing the evil tricks of ad-Dajjal?

Then a divine message from above. ""Ithaca campus classes are cancelled 2/7."" There is a noticeable pause in the line of people trudging uphill, a feeling of tension and confusion that permeates the air.

Moments pass, and we turn around and walk back to North campus, not as students struggling to get to class, but as free beings about to enter a day of possibility and liberty.

curiousengi,"‘Twas the night before Slope Day  
When all through the dorm   
Not a creature was stirring  
Not even a worm

&#x200B;

The liquor was hidden on Libe with care  
With the hopes that the squad would soon be there  
The freshmen were nestled all snug in their beds  
While visions of Steve Aoki danced in their heads 

&#x200B;

When out of the window, there arose some clamor  
It was some frat boys, who were clearly quite hammered  
I told them to beat it, and of course they declined  
While insulting my mother, which wasn’t too kind.

&#x200B;

I called the police, who are needed far too often  
Since these young men were clearly besotten  
Twiddling my thumbs, I heard nary a siren  
And the lads outside certainly weren’t tirin’

&#x200B;

When above from the sky, I saw a shimmering light  
And a figure descending, in lab coat, lucid white  
‘Twas Bill Nye, our childhood hero and liege

Who had come to save us from the fraternity siege

&#x200B;

He raised his hands, and said with a sigh  
“I’m Bill Nye, The Science Guy!”  
These boys bowed down to him out of fear 

Also realizing that they had drunk far too much beer

&#x200B;

On to their home they went and shuffled their feet  
Up and through Collegetown Streets  
Bill Nye turned to me and said to cherish these days  
Since life after school is just shades of bleak grays  
And then I heard him exclaim, as he rose out of sight

so I am looking to put together a support group. We can all get together, talk about how fucked up we are, laugh, cry, meet people in the same boat. or i’ll meet with you one on one, either way. 

nobody deserves to feel that level of loneliness. nobody deserves to feel hopeless.

sorry this isn’t more eloquent, but please just hear me out. i’m here for you. please PM me, i’ll give you my number, we can get together, one on one, in a group, whatever. 

i don’t want anybody, let alone fellow cornellians to feel the way i have so often. let’s talk. i’ll be your friend. please pm. 

just hold on, one day at a time. we can do it together, okay? 

please contact the crisis hotline if you are in a state of emergency, and know that any interactions with me or any future group should not substitute for professional treatment or crisis assistance. i’m just looking to put a more human face on mental illness, and offer an opportunity for fellowship in hardship.

narlue,"i'm a rising freshman coming from a high-risk state. my hardship waiver got rejected, despite my home life making it extremely difficult for me to do online school from home (my psychiatrist even sent an email supporting my waiver app saying i couldn't do school from home) and one of my more important classes being in-person. my family couldn't afford a hotel stay in new york for two weeks. i pulled money out of my savings and worked as many overtime/overnight shifts as i possibly could (i'm a nursing assistant) to get the money for a stay in new york as soon as i found out cornell wouldn't provide quarantine housing. this was incredibly stressful but i knew it would be worth it. the cheapest stay i could find was from august 10th-24th, so i traveled up and have been quarantining since the 10th. i emailed housing multiple times to ask about move-in dates and attempt to ensure that my move-in date would be the 24th to align with my quarantine, but they never answered (understandable considering the pressure they've been under). 

fast forward to yesterday, when move-in dates came out. i got the 29th. i understand that i'm supposed to email housing to change my move-in date, and i did. i called and emailed them, and even emailed VP lombardi to ensure that my change request would be accepted. at this point, though, i really don't have any faith in the idea of housing accepting or even responding to my request. i can't afford another hotel stay. i can't even afford food to last the extra five days from the 24th-29th. i have mental health issues and at this point if i need to stay in a hotel another five days i'll have to cancel my future psychiatry & therapy appointments. i'm frustrated and anxious and i know a lot of others are feeling the same way.

i get that this is probably a bit dramatic and unnecessary, and i know that housing is really doing their best right now. everything is just so uncertain and i'm really having trouble managing it. it feels like cornell really has not put their best foot forward regarding the move-in process and students from low-income households and/or toxic home environments are the ones suffering. i understand that these are crazy times and they're doing what they need to do to abide by health guidelines, but would it really have been that hard to let students who had to find their own quarantine housing request a specific move-in date to avoid all this?

sorry for the rant. i hope everyone in this subreddit is doing well despite the circumstances. and if anyone is in a similar situation to me i hope all works out for them. :)

EDIT: it’s come to my awareness that some people think i made this up to get money or internet validation or something of the sort. i would like to make it VERY VERY clear that i’m not asking for money here or groceries or anything like that. i was upset and in the mood to rant when i wrote this post. again, i was in no way asking for money or help from anyone. i really am sorry if i didn’t make that clear enough. the point of this post, aside from being a rant on my part, was to talk about how this situation is disproportionately affecting certain individuals and perhaps even show students in a situation similar to mine that they are not alone. again, i’m sorry i didn’t make that clear. i wasn’t asking for anything from the members of this subreddit, aside from maybe some kind words and support. i’m just a student who was upset and made a post thinking it might bring awareness to an issue and some semblance of solidarity for students in my position. again, i’m sorry if i didn’t make that clear enough. i haven’t accepted money from anyone and i have no plans to do so at the moment.",currently at a loss (kinda a rant),193,0.97,ia8lve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/ia8lve/currently_at_a_loss_kinda_a_rant/,31,1597531712.0,2020-08-15 17:48:32

jdguy17,"Some of you may have applied with other schools being off a higher priority for you. And that's okay. I originally wanted Yale, and when I didn't get into Yale, I thought I wanted RIT over Cornell. 

However, I'm really sorry you won't be able to visit as part of Cornell days (or visit other schools during their respective pre-frosh programs). In 2016, that was how I came to determine that Cornell was going to be the right place for me, and that the other universities would've been poor fits (or, as I'm convinced with RIT after visiting, downright depressed).

In light of not being able to do that, please reach out to us on this subreddit (and any other resources my fellow Cornellians wish to share, I can't seem to think of them right now myself) and ask questions. And don't go off of our school year posts alone (definitely read them if your interested), because this is often a forum for complaining and blowing off steam for some Redditors, and thus negative thoughts are disproportionately expressed (and thank you to those who almost only post positive stuff). But seriously, ask us your questions. We want to answer and help you determine if Cornell is the place for you as it is for most of us. And do the same with any other school your considering.

And professors on here, I know you're incredibly busy getting the rest of our semester organized, but if you get spare moments, please respond to some of these soon-to-be Cornellians' questions.  The professor that pulled me and my parents aside to her office on Gates when we visited to get a perspective as to what I was interested in, to answer some questions I had, and to just chat for a bit, made a huge difference in my perspective on Cornell, and ultimately I may not have ended up at the right university for me, met the best friends I've ever had, and started the best relationship I could've asked for. And while I'm glad I got the chance to thank her in person before I left, I really don't think I can thank her enough for that.

P.S. when asking us questions, include the major you're most interested in. It obviously may change, but it signals to people with that perspective.

carllyq,"I just heard from a friend that a few of his department's professors in their 60s and 70s will voluntarily teach in-person classes because of their deeply held pedagogical principles and the belief in their duty to provide students with the best learning experience possible. On the one hand, of course, immense respect for these professors, who are true educators and the real bedrocks of Cornell. On the other hand, I'm worried for them. It will be incredibly sad and even infuriating if people like them get sick (or worse) because other people are not taking the pandemic seriously. So I really really hope their students (and everyone else) will be respectful and considerate, practice social distancing, wear masks, and abide by the rules.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not trying to imply that professors/TAs who choose to teach online are ""lesser"" educators and care less about students and teaching. Online teaching can be very challenging and requires a lot of work and innovation to do it right. I was just trying to remind people of the potential sacrifice that some professors are making and it's not meant as a comparison or competition as that would be pointless.

Was at Cornell from 2013 to 2017. I've been really tight lipped about this, but I feel the need to tell the Cornell world about a secret I've been holding on to.

You know the honey roasted peanut butter they sell in the various markets across campus? It's fucking amazing. Legitimately the best peanut butter I've ever had. I miss it every day. I've been thinking about ordering it off the Cornell Store website and getting it shipped to me. Bonus: go to bus stop bagels, ask for a bagel with this peanut butter and banana. Best breakfast in the world. I got it so many times that the workers there started making my order right when I walked in. 

One of my Cornell regrets was not knowing about this until my junior year. Seriously, get yourself some of that shit.

mgtow_throwawa,"This year, it was announced that women now outnumber men in the engineering school. While many are celebrating this, I seek to explain why this is wrong.

Engineering is something that only men can effectively do. Engineering is based in mechanics and machines, which require masculine energy. The two energies male and female only one for machines.

I'll give you an example. Imagine you're doing some analysis in Matlab, and your code isn't working. The proper way to do this is to whip your dick out and bang your computer with it until your code works. This is something only a man can do and not a woman.

Another thing is the way men and women handle pressures. For example, imagine an engineer fails a prelim. The proper way to handle this is to strip down naked, run into Duffield Hall, and shit on the floor while rolling around in your own shit. Do you think it is even appropriate for a well-mannered woman to do this??

ProfessorMeowSteve,"Earlier this week I went to Okenshields for lunch, and, as a connoisseur of fine cuisine, I partook of the stir-fry. I noticed that it tasted a bit off, but I don’t like to waste food so I powered through and finished my plate. I then went to the stir-fry station to alert the chef that the stir-fry was not up to par, but when I arrived at the station I could see a mask-wearing dining hall worker shoveling the rest of the stir-fry into an odd looking bin with weird symbols and warnings on its side. Evidently my criticism was unnecessary, so I left. However, from then on I began feeling out of sorts. I developed a nasty cough, my head hurt, and I had trouble sleeping the following night.

Undeterred, I went back to Okenshields the next day. As I was walking out, I noticed that Happy Dave’s bowl of mints was almost empty. I brought this to his attention, and he thanked me. We got to chatting, and I mentioned my weird stir-fry experience from the previous day. Although he kept smiling, I noticed something subtle change in his expression. He began asking questions about how much I’d eaten, what symptoms I was experiencing, my familiarity with the Chinese coronavirus, and my opinions on controlled killings of infected members of society to prevent the start of an epidemic. I thought these questions were a bit unusual, and I couldn’t tell if he was implying something or just making smalltalk. I began feeling uneasy, so said goodbye and quickly walked away. He tried to go after me, but a line had formed so he had to swipe in hungry students. As I walked up the stairs from Okenshields, though, I heard him yell at me that he was sorry.

My symptoms have worsened since then, and in the past few days I’ve noticed Happy Dave following me around campus. Sometimes he’s subtle about it, hiding in bushes or perching in trees that I pass by. Other times he dons a backpack and wig and sits close to me in class, masquerading as a student. I have to bring my own water bottle to dining halls now because I’ve seen him slipping a weird tablet into my glass that makes my drink smell like almonds. The other day I swear I heard a bullet whizzing past my head as I descended Libe Slope, and when I looked up I caught a brief glimpse of Happy Dave scuttling away from a grassy knoll, decked out in a ghillie suit and face paint (his hair gave away his identity). 

I don’t want to die. I never even got the chance to take Formal Verification with Clarkson. Just in case I don't make it: please scatter my ashes in Okenshields. Give all of my possessions to my family, except for my dice collection, which should be given to Michael George.

deflatedshark,"As someone who spent all of freshmen and most of sophomore year with no friends/bad friends, and now has tons of amazing friends, here are some of my tips! (Also this is my personal experience, take with a grain of salt). Hope this helps someone!

1. People say ""join clubs"" so willy nilly!! I think the key is to find an activity, like a job or club where you have to spend A LOT of time together. I joined a million clubs, but never made true friends in them because we only met for like two hours once a week. Being on a club sport, working job shifts, or something tighter knit (joining frat, becoming an RA, doing a PE that meets everyday, hanging out with people where you live) allows you to see the same people more frequently, which makes it easier to make friends!
2. Date someone! Okay, HEAR ME OUT. I know, how do you date someone when you barely even have friends? This one greatly depends on your comfort levels/relative attractiveness. I had literally never been on a date before, but I made a tinder and matched with someone who invited me to a party (literally my first house party, and they had no idea LMAO) , where I met some amazing people. As long as you're nice and have common interests, its pretty easy to slide into the friend group of someone you're ""dating"". One of my closest friends now is the old roommate of someone I dated. However, this one can also backfire pretty easy, so remain cautious.
3. Don't be too dismissive of people! Being friendless made me veryyyyy bitter. I'd see super loud sorority girls or frat bros in dining halls and lectures and think ""Wow, I'd never be friends with someone like that"". No one wants to be friends with someone who's super bitter (also they had friends and I didn't so who am I even to judge). You shouldn't be friends with people you don't want to, but be willing to give it a shot. I'm friends with athletes and greek life students, even though I'm neither.
4. Utilize your major! You probably spend a decent amount of time studying. I know theres that person you see in a ton of your classes, but you have NO idea what their name is. BITE THE BULLET AND ASK. Study buddies are a great way to bond and get work done. 
5. You're not gonna want to hear this, but if you're like me, you might have a funny lil boii called Social Anxiety. And if so, I'm so sorry but you're gonna have to force yourself to talk. Trust, I can barely order at Nasties without dying inside, but it makes it a lot harder to make friends if you're not able to communicate consistently and openly. This is a lot easier said than done, and took several months of forcing myself to talk in classes to get used to speaking to strangers.
6. Be kind and patient with yourself. Some people make friends for life during O-week. For others, it takes a bit of time. I was always so lonely, and thought I'd never truly find companionship here. There are ups and downs, I've made friends and also lost some, but it all will work out for you :).",Tips on how to make friends from someone who had none,177,0.98,f01iwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/f01iwt/tips_on_how_to_make_friends_from_someone_who_had/,7,1581061578.0,2020-02-07 01:46:18

MikeRichardson112,"Hello to everyone in the Ithaca and wider Cornell community. I have grown increasingly concerned about the situation in Ithaca. Living downtown these last few years has given me a much different perspective than when I was up on campus almost all of the time. 

A great many articles are written mentioning Ithaca as an idyllic small community. And of course in many ways it is. I love the variety of restaurants, the culture, and most of all the people from all around the world. I feel fortunate to live here. A number of issues that have been an aspect of Ithaca since I arrived are now impossible to ignore. 

These issues relate to homeless, drug addiction (primarily heroin), and crime. It is easy for many in this community to forget that there are thousands of Ithacans who are literally on the wrong side of the train tracks; Subsidized housing on West Hill like West Village, originally barracks for soldiers at the now shuttered Army facility, and the even worse apartments on Chestnut. And yet more subsidized housing by Wegmans, the DMV. 

These are people most likely with no ties to
Cornell, beyond possibly working there. These are people for whom Ithaca is not a quaint small town, but still one of the most expensive places to live. It is within these communities that the issues of crime, drugs & violence have reached a crescendo. 

You have likely seen it yourself. The purple building next to DSS, formerly Planned Parenthood and now the shuttered Southern Tier AIDS Partnership, has become a focal point of drug abuse. Aggressive panhandlers accost passers by. I spoke to a police officer, who confirmed what I already knew; Property crime is up “a lot.” Every car on a downtown street has its windows smashed. There are multiple armed robberies in a single evening. 

In short; Do not assume you are safe just because Ithaca is a small town. There is an active criminal element here. You’ll see the needles and blue water ampoules from heroin users. People supporting their habits by dealing drugs and engaging in theft have become more desperate and brazen. 

Keep your eyes open to what is going on around you. Things have been getting bad for years but they have started to get way worse recently. I have no idea what the solution is. I do believe everyone deserves a heads up. This is like watching a slow motion train wreck.",Ithaca is not safe anymore,172,0.85,hyfasq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/hyfasq/ithaca_is_not_safe_anymore/,63,1595828056.0,2020-07-27 00:34:16

,"I just don't see anything wrong with this. I feel like it could be pretty good.

&#x200B;

I would never have to go to the career fair again and make a fake conversation with PwC or Deloitte. There would be no bullshit competition. No one would ask me how my summer was — just to hear where I interned so they could one-up me. I wouldn't have to pretend to know more Java than I actually do. I wouldn't faintly smile and walk away.

EveryPrior,"There is no reason for a university president to make over a million dollars a year. Administrative bloat is what is driving up our tuition and reducing the number of full time professors in our classrooms. Adjuncts and grad students are some of the best teachers I've had but they can't sustain living on what they earn and that affects their performance in the classroom.

I know the argument is normally that admins could make more in the private sector hence the higher pay but I would argue that universities are unique enterprises that don't follow typical market rules. First, they have a more or less captive market and, more importantly, are governed by moral not just financial motives. This is why they're considerd non-profits. Reduce administrative bloat, and you take a big step toward solving a number of so-called ""crises"" in academia.

Plus, you'd see a much wider range of disciplinary representation (not just STEM and law) at the helm of universities. And you just know a philosopher would cancel at the drop of a hat for a snow day.",administrator's pay should not be significantly higher than a (tenured) professor's pay,170,0.93,e4z05y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/e4z05y/administrators_pay_should_not_be_significantly/,42,1575321675.0,2019-12-02 15:21:15

BaeXite,"I graduated this past May after an incredibly stressful, amazing, awful, and unforgettable four years at Cornell. Cornell is a school that beats you silly but leaves you impressively prepared for the future. It really is a place where what you get out of it is proportional to what you put into it. I met a few incredible groups of people on the way that I'm proud to call my friends, did stupid things, cried myself to sleep, and spent a few semesters eternally sleep-deprived and behind on work.

There are often posts in this subreddit about dreading the coming semester, or being depressed and anxious. As someone who had all of the above be the case multiple times, I would just like to say that there are many who silently feel exactly how you do. And that's okay. It's intimidating, it is most certainly a constant battle, and it is easy to remind yourself of past mistakes or regrets. But you cannot let that paralyze you and prevent you from obtaining the life and future you want at Cornell. It is a constant struggle and I hope you can rely upon or find a support system that works for you.

Some things that helped me personally figure out how to succeed at Cornell:

1) Dealing with the overcast. The constant grey, literal atmosphere of stress, and the ever-present ""doom and gloom"" takes a huge toll on everyone. I personally resorted to using a light alarm clock and giving myself light therapy (which I bought on Amazon for like 25 dollars). With the winter and inability to see the sun for the next few months, most people don't realize what a huge effect it actually has on their psyche. Giving yourself some exposure to light helps with waking up on time and with feeling like how you think you ""should feel"".

2) Being active. Exercise and lots of water can solve a lot more issues than most realize. A lot of issues that I had with low energy and exhaustion was at least aided by staying hydrated like my life depended on it. Working out hard actually made me crave water even more. With exercise, it's easy to say that you don't have time to workout because you need to study, but when you set out a ten hour block to study I think it's fair to say that you're usually not productive for all ten of those hours. Why not take an hour of that unproductive time to lift some weights, play a few games of basketball, or even punch and kick a heavy bag? It's especially good if you can get a buddy or two to go with you and keep you accountable while motivating you to work harder. Which brings me to my next thing,

3) Turn the little things into group activities. A personal anecdote: I lived below the slope for my last two years at Cornell, and as the semester got colder and darker I had immense difficulty with just getting ready and going to class. I would sit in bed depressed or at least very low energy, able to wake up at 7 am but only leave my house at 12 pm after missing 2 or 3 classes. Even if it wasn't a specific issue that kept me down (which it doesn't have to be!), I ended up doing this week after week. It left me constantly guilty and only exhausted me more. What worked for me was having friends who kept me accountable, whether they knew it or not. The simple action of asking a housemate/roommate/friend/ classmate if you can go to class together is an incredible motivator for getting ready and making it out of bed. Something as simple as ""hey, do you want to meet outside of the dorm at 8:30 so we can walk to class together"" or ""hey let's make Saturday afternoon a cleaning day"" goes a very long way. The goal is to make these little things easier to do. Let the motivation come from multiple people, not just yourself. By making it easier to do, you can build discipline and good habits which will help immensely in the long run. Everyone at Cornell is trying to make it through just like you and achieve their goals in the long run.

4) Take care of yourself, take care of your minds, and take care of your bodies. When you're at your lowest, you deserve to at least have yourself backing you up. It's okay to ask for help. It's so easy to say that all you need to do to do better in a class is to just ""spend more time studying myself"". That ""questions will come once I study more"". But there are professors, TAs, tutors, older students, and peers who may have a more efficient study strategy or a better understanding of the topic and can help you learn it ""by yourself"" even faster! So ask them. Don't feel ashamed to ask or think that you are wasting anyone's time. All it takes it is the courage to go up and say that you need help and that makes all the difference.


All I want to say is, it's okay to have off days. It's okay to move at a slower pace, even if everyone seems to show off that what you're doing isn't good enough. It's so easy to tell yourself that you'll never be good enough. But that is not how progress is made. It's important to reward yourself for improvement and it's equally as important to not beat yourself up over not making enough improvement. Please try to remember that and keep a positive outlook, no matter how grim it may seem! Cornell is a place where you learn how to learn. You will never stop learning how to learn for the rest of your life! But you can set a damn good foundation while you're here.

I hope everyone has an absolutely wonderful semester and if you need someone to talk to or ask questions, feel free to DM me and I'd be happy to talk or even get you in touch with friends and people at Cornell that can help you out.

https://www.instagram.com/cornellras/



I understand there will be a RA strike today on North Campus due to elevating concerns of safety and unfulfilled promises of reporting/behavior correcting systems (among various other points). Student staff on West Campus have been invited to participate in a show of solidarity, but have chosen not to do so. THIS IS NOT BECAUSE WEST CAMPUS DOES NOT SHARE THESE CONCERNS, but find it unfortunate they will not be showing visible support. 



As a staff member, who watches their colleagues wear down further every day with nothing left for their families or personal life when they go home, I'd like to say there are many of us willing to participate in demonstration.  It can be scary and daunting to stand up, especially being raised into adulthood during a time where you were told to keep your head down at work and faced with the harsh reality that there is no ""choice"" in working in this world of diminishing opportunity and rampant economic inequality. It can also be challenging when many of your superiors are people you do not want to let down as many of us have  developed friendships. The professional community can be welcoming and productive here. Standing up to Cornell is not necessarily an affront to those doing the best they can with the plate they have been served while trying to lead you. Our voices can be heard without jeopardizing our jobs.



If this goes well (and I hope it does) I applaud Cornell for  pulling it off. It will have come as a great benefit to much of the student body and without a doubt  surely Cornell stands to walk away with more than academic success. At what cost to us though? They have thrown out numbers such as 100s to 1000 positive cases from a non-peer reviewed study to hide behind and point to if come to fruition as expected and thus acceptable. What mental and physical toll of the staff is expected to pull this off with nothing more than a pat on the back for your hard work? Especially without the decency of robust communication from administration, but instead being fed the same talking points since May...essentially saying ""don't worry, we hear your concerns, but we are right"". There is a feeling in many of you that there is no other way forward, because that is what you are being told.



How many departmental letters, assembly correspondence, and community concerns need to be ignored before action is taken?



I urge anyone who feels they are not being heard to reach out and stand up together. PM me, each other, and let's organize; students, staff, and faculty alike. Lets put on our masks and take this off of zoom and message boards and onto campus.

On our own, our concerns are nothing. I know it takes a lot of courage to stand up, but it is a necessary part of progress.

_browneyes,"It seems like a lot of people on the subreddit are pretty unhappy with the reopening plan. To be honest, Martha’s email was far from a detailed and comprehensive report that instilled confidence in the student body. But I think that the opportunity to go back to campus is literally so important for some people and shouldn’t be trivialized. For many, college represents an escape from really bad home/family situations. The value of reuniting with friends at Cornell isn’t one that’s always rooted in selfish desires to be social again, for a lot of people friends/faculty are the only support system they’ve ever known. Obviously if you don’t think campus is safe/ don’t think it’s worth it, you’re well within your right to just stay home. I agree we should push for tuition to be reduced for remote learning because it is just fundamentally not the same experience as in-person.

math2210_HELP_PLZ,"Rich kids of r/Cornell can downvote this all you want (and the ""I'm not rich, I'm upper MIDDLE CLASS"" kids). But this post is not for you, it is a warning to low income students come Spring, especially those who think that Cornell will reevaluate their aid after accepting their offers.

Don't get me wrong, I feel like I've grown literal superpowers in CS after taking some of the interesting courses here like 2112, 3110, and now 4820, but the fact of the matter is that I had to spend my first year quite literally starving because Cornell refused to adjust the parental contribution based on my noncustodials income from 2 years ago (and he has long since been unemployed -- and my aid appeals have long been repeatedly ignored on ridiculous stinginess of the FA office). 

Out of the advice of the ever all-knowing, low-income student-loving FA office (an excuse to not grant my aid appeal), I stayed home in this sh*thole neighborhood with my mother, only for them to take out the cost of housing out of my PELL GRANT and Cornell Grant.

Nevermind my own personal experiences with FA, the student atmosphere here regarding poor kids is the fucking worst. Meeting people and them having a conversation about how they hate that other kids get financial aid is awkward and will make you feel guilty. Them asking you why your room isn't embezzled in decorations and supplies (printers, coffee machines, etc) when the real answer is that you couldn't justify spending that money fucking hurts. 

In the end, I do still think going to Cornell is a net positive -- by a long shot. But it definitely does suck having to worry about an empty stomach and finances while already being stressed with my coursework.

1. Email your professors! Tell them about this discussion and ask them how they plan on mitigating these and other strategies to keep grades fair.
2. [Share this petition](http://chng.it/qPnmxvhCyc) with your friends! It’s essentially a more explicit way to say “I agree” than upvoting on Reddit. I was blown away by how far a similar petition was able to get the much bigger ask of the S/U debate.

# Update: CS3410 and ECE3100 Online Prelims Canceled

ECE3100 and CS3410's second prelim has been canceled. Professors agree, online prelims are just not the right choice in our crazy situation.

""The focus of the new policies are on learning while acknowledging the challenges of virtual instruction and stress related to the disruptions due to COVID-19. As a result, prelim 2 and Project 5 have been canceled. We added a homework, instead. "" (CS3410)

**Update: Added stories.**

&#x200B;

# Original Post Below

&#x200B;

I’m going to ignore all other problems with online prelims (e.g., connection problems) to focus on the most obvious and concerning one: It’s simple, online STEM prelims will be invalid due to inevitable, rampant, uncontrolled cheating.

&#x200B;

Hypothetical likely adversarial scenario:

1. Person X joins a group VC with a number of other students
2. Person X shares his screen and begins the test.
3. Every person in the group call collaborates on completing the questions and picks answers by consensus.
4. Every question and the corresponding answer is recorded in a Google Doc.
5. Person X finishes the test and the group moves on to Person Y.
6. Repeat 2-5, only using pre-existing answers in the Google Doc. If the question bank is larger than the number of questions on the test, add extra questions to the Doc along the way.
7. Eventually, the Google Doc will have the majority of correct answers.
8. Group shares the doc to trusted friends.

&#x200B;

Alternative strategy:

1. Person $ pays internet math person or a TA friend to take the test for them, and records the answers.
2. Shares answers with trusted friends.

&#x200B;

Alternative strategy:

1. Person #’s obsessive immoral helicopter parents (who, thanks to Coronavirus, are once again in control of their every move) take the test for them or farm it out to a tutor.
2. Answers shared with trusted friends.

&#x200B;

Alternative (Less effective) strategy:

1. Person G Wolfram Alpha/Googles all of the answers.

&#x200B;

Some suggest extremely privacy-invasive online proctoring services. Even if Cornell departments hadn’t essentially banned them (as they seem to have), online cheating countermeasures are useless when you’re dealing with some of the most clever CS/Engineering students in the country. The planned Canvas prelims will make cheating so easy that those who don’t cheat will be at a significant disadvantage. This obvious reality will pressure even more otherwise honest people to cheat until the grades for the prelim become meaningless as a measure of mastery. As-is an online prelim is a hand-out to the less morally stringent among us and will likely draw in even many students who have never cheated before. They’ll think “Well, there’s so much chaos right now, this doesn’t feel real anyway so it doesn’t matter! I need this grade! How dare (outside force/the universe) make me do this!”

They won’t take any personal responsibility for their actions and they’ll never be caught.

For an uncontrolled online test in such a high-pressure global environment, cheating is unavoidably the dominant strategy.

I’ve heard about the extra emphasis on the academic integrity principals before, but the only thing I can imagine is PayPal issuing a statement saying “Please don’t hack us and steal all of these innocent peoples’ money, it’s the wrong thing to do!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This isn't fiction or just hypothetical, **it's already happening**. People on the Cornell subreddit and elsewhere have been telling their stories of people beginning to organize only a few days into remote learning:

>\[T\]he amount of insidiousness that occurred during the CV take home from what I've heard was enough to convince me to agree with everything you've said...when the prof announced that the prelim was a take-home then there was group chats of large size and a many that were formed.

&#x200B;

>I also heard stuff about the CV prelim. Literally a few hours after it was announced that it'd be take home, I heard people at Oishii saying that they'd get a group of 5 or so people and work on it together.

&#x200B;

>\-> take home quizzes have already been collaborated on, it's just a fact of the circumstances  
>  
>  
>  
>Which class?  
>  
>  
>  
>\-> I've heard of it for 4700

&#x200B;

Some suggest that S/U would reduce pressure on people and reduce the drive to cheat. Realistically, S/U isn’t an option for any of the people who would be driven to cheat unless it’s mandatory.

To me, it seems like replacing online prelims with long and open-ended take-homes or oral exams is one of the only options other than canceling them entirely. I don’t suggest this lightly as I’ve forgotten a massive amount of info over the past couple of weeks getting back up to that kind of speed will certainly take some work. If I’m being honest, this whole situation is exactly why grades in general for non-liberal arts classes will likely never be a viable representation of mastery like what is possible during a normal semester. However, that’s out of all of our hands now. What matters is creating a system that avoids rewarding and creating cheaters however possible.

lbjs_bunghole,"Eating in Okenshields rn for lunch, happy Dave swipes me in and gives me my complimentary pre-rolled blunt. I thank him, smoke that shit up, and suddenly I’m surrounded by strippers. I look at their bodies from head to toe, confused, but when I get to their heads they all look alike. No, not alike, they’re all the same. Atop the body of a group of female strippers is the head of David Gries. 7 David Gries’s look me straight in the eyes. The first speaks and says: “You must recite the four loopy questions to enter”

But I dropped 2110. I couldn’t do it; I couldn’t get in.

Then a flash of light shocks the group, and Happy Dave appears in front of me dressed in a black ninja uniform. Regaining their composure, the female Gries’s stare menacingly at Ninja Dave. Without speaking, Dave motions for the one directly facing him to attack. The first one does and shouts “56 YEARS,” followed by the second that shouted “57 YEARS” and so on. 

With Okenshield’s playlist (namely Party in the USA) blaring in the background, Dave kicks, punches, and renders each Gries unconscious. He then clears a path of bodies for me to enter. I do and enjoy some chicken quesadillas and shumai. When I leave I take a mint.

I hate the pretentiousness of so many people who circlejerk about this place being a magical unicorn wonderland of special smart unicorns, while dissing other colleges and universities; I spent time in community college and have met plenty of intelligent and down to earth people there too.

I hate all the fake, vacuous, self-absorbed dickheads that I wasted my time on trying to nice to - but that's probably more my fault.

I hate the huge stigma around mental health and the months-long waiting times at Cornell Health before seeing a psychiatrist that doesn't give two shits about me. I have struggled with severe depression, anxiety and PTSD and it only gets worse whenever I come back here.

And I HATE busting my ass paying for health insurance and rent while serving dining hall food to people in $1,300 Canada Goose jackets that can't even say fucking thank you.

I know some of you like it and I'm genuinely happy for you. But I personally can't wait to finally get that piece of paper and bail out of here in May.  


EDIT: In spite of everything, I think it would be unfair not to mention that my professors have been absolutely amazing.

Surveillance testing has not even begun yet.  Now that we are here, what is Cornell doing to do to disincentivize the behavior that has led to this? Suspensions should be given out liberally, and those who continue to remain in the Ithaca area after suspension and are caught partying should be expelled. Period. While the identities of those punished cannot be identified by the administration for privacy reasons, word will spread, and the university can share general statistics on punishments and noncompliance. We are all adults, and have gathered here with a full understanding of the public health consequences associated with noncompliance. Those who refuse to appreciate the consequences on the basis of public health must be served consequences at the university level.

n0n0thing0,"As the title says, I am on the SA. I have been reading some of the recent posts/comments and wanted to further shed light on what goes on internally. These are things that you do not see and will likely never hear of. I have some level of respect for my colleagues and will not use any names or title positons. I cannot go into much detail but will try my best to portray how the show runs. As far as a solution goes, I do not have all the answers but make a recommendation based on my perspective.

From my perspective, the problem with the SA is mostly cultural. This stems from the members, particularly the leadership. If you pay close attention, you will see that there is an inner-circle. The inner-circle includes most of the leadership and a few outspoken individuals. They are all friends and control the assembly in almost every aspect. They dictate what resolutions are heard, which resolutions pass, and who gets elected into leadership roles. The only thing they do not have control over is the external elections (where the students get to vote).

The way you get power or leadership roles on the SA is through internal elections. These elections determine the executive committee (except for the President and Executive Vice President) and committee seats. Members of the inner-circle all vote for their friends, which is how they maintain power. These people are very organized and will assign positions for their friends to run for. On the day of the election, they already know their favored candidates' speech and who will get what. During deliberation, where members get to discuss candidates, members of the inner-circle will uplift one another while speaking negatively about other candidates. You will not believe the stuff I have heard come out of some of my colleagues' mouths when talking about other members. In reality, if you run against one of them in these elections, you do not stand a chance.

Due to the power they have, they can effectively pass any resolution they want as they have nearly guaranteed themselves approval. If you are not part of this inner-circle and you even as much as question a proposal, you will be ostracized. If you dare to bring up any point of reasonable criticism, be prepared to be labeled a bigot of sorts. You thought the comments under The Sun article were bad? If only you could all see what is said behind closed doors. Now, remember those internal-elections I talked about earlier? Yes, they do not forget either. They will use your dissent against you and do their best to make sure you do not come anywhere close to any leadership positions.

If you bring up any of this to them, they will, of course, deny it. The culture on the SA is toxic, to say the least, and there is a good number of SA members who agree. However, they cannot say anything publicly due to fear of retaliation. We are forced to vote in support of resolutions we do not agree with. The next time you are at a SA meeting, look at the faces of your representatives as they vote for a resolution they do not agree with (I can assure you it is not pretty).

For the SA to change, **you will have to vote the current leadership out.** The inner-circle takes advantage of the fact that about less than 40% of the undergraduate population votes. Lower voter turnout makes it is easier for them to rely on their same electoral base and campaign tactics. By the way, pay attention to the candidates. Often, the inner-circle helps one another similarly to how they do during internal-elections. This, of course, is prohibited. But, they do whatever they can and try to find ways around. There is an election coming up this Fall 2020. It is a pivotal election because several of the SA members who were part of the ""machine"" are either graduating or gone. Use this opportunity to elect the right leaders. Reach out to your SA representatives and let them know they have your support and encourage them to stand up for the truth and open dialogue. Additionally, continue to call them out on their crap and hold them accountable. Show up to the meetings and ask questions. **Continue posting online, messaging representatives, and demanding change**. **They can get away with most of what they do, due to your perceived apathy.**

Lastly, as I said before, the inner-circle essentially has control over which resolutions pass. This is probably their biggest fault. If you do a simple search of the resolutions that have been passed over the last year or so, look at each of the sponsors. Notice which names keep making an appearance and which ones keep showing up together. **That is your inner-circle.**

I am passionate about shared-governance, which is why I am on the assembly. I know several people who were or are in the same boat as I am (even more passionate). These are smart, driven, genuine student leaders who, because of the SA culture, were smothered or forced to quit. It a really sad situation. Sometimes, I contemplate why I am still a part of this organization. No other organization I have ever been a part of, on or off-campus, behaves like this. I cannot begin to illustrate to you how infuriated my peers and I are by our experiences in this organization, and then for us to have to keep quiet. I am just glad people are finally seeing what is truly going on. Keep up the pressure.","What is wrong with the SA and how to fix it, from the perspective of a member.",159,0.93,hk80fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/hk80fr/what_is_wrong_with_the_sa_and_how_to_fix_it_from/,23,1593761213.0,2020-07-03 02:26:53

trevordavis4sa,"Dear Cornell University,

From the outset of this campaign, my goal was simple: to add something impressive-sounding to my resume. Today, I am proud to say that with my election to the position of Undesignated At-Large Student Assembly Representative, that dream has been achieved. This was a tremendous victory for the 1,852 supporters who voted to entrust me with the top elected position on Student Assembly, and for my future career prospects.

Because of each and every one of you, I can confidently tell recruiters at Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, or even JP Morgan that I was elected to serve as a full voting member on the Cornell Student Assembly. I will be able to explain to them how Undesignated At-Large Representatives get to talk about stuff at meetings, vote on big important resolutions, and even serve on committees with fancy-sounding names.

I would also like to congratulate Joe Anderson on his victory in the presidential election. It speaks to how effectively the SA communicates and engages with the student body that the campus decided, by no matter how slim a margin, that the presidency deserves to go to someone professing an actual desire to serve. I hope Joe uses his very powerful mandate, cemented by the voters’ marginal preference, to continue the work students so clearly understand and value.

Cornell, my one promise this campaign was to put an SA position on my resume. Which is why, now that the promise has been fulfilled, I am proud to announce that I will be stepping down from my position on Student Assembly, effective immediately. I hope I have served my supporters well by being the first SA electee to complete all of my campaign promises, and by doing it after just one day as Undesignated At-Large Student Assembly Representative-Elect.

This campaign was a joy to run, and I’d like to thank all of the wonderful people who took us all the way to the top of the mountain, or at least to an adjacent plateau. From the bottom of my heart and the new top section on my resume, thank you, Cornell.",Trevor Davis Campaign Statement on Election Results,161,0.95,b6jzlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/b6jzlv/trevor_davis_campaign_statement_on_election/,15,1553814779.0,2019-03-28 18:12:59

999288,"Evan Lambrou (101 Dryden) is a horrible, manipulative landlord. Trust me, YOU DO NOT WANT TO SIGN ANY APARTMENT WITH HIM. He manipulates the fact that students don't know much about real estate. Halfway in my contract, he tried to argue his way with me about raising our monthly rent AFTER signing. He said that we owe it to him because he has paid for wifi and water, which ""other landlords don't provide"". Except... that was part of the offer in signing with him for our original contract...?  Had to fight with him for 3 hours on the phone. Keep in mind, whenever you call him for some simple issue you want him to fix, he will make you stay on the phone with him for an hour to talk about how he provides you with ""amazing benefits,"" and manipulates the topics of the conversation so you feel like it's your responsibility to get your heating system fixed, etc.  

He's lost my checks before and then blamed me on 3 separate occassions. I had to go through the annoying process of contacting my bank those 3 times to confirm that I've sent my checks in and then had to call him to let him know. And somehow he magically finds those checks. Waste of time. He has no administrative skills-- he clearly does not keep track of his documents in a single place. 

It is worse because he lives in texas and has no office in Ithaca. So if you can't get a reach of him on the phone, then you're screwed. His mother lives in Ithaca but she does not answer any calls, ever. you need to call about 10 times for her to answer. It took me 4 months of trying to contact him and his mother after I left ithaca to get my security deposit back. Then, he finally returns only half of it. We never even left a scratch in the apartment (mostly because I barely stayed there for other reasons). I asked all my other friends who lived in 101 Dryden and turns out he took out $400-500 from each person, so he takes $800- $1,000 from the deposit per unit. He didn't even provide a professional, formal breakdown of the deductions. It was scribbled on a piece of paper by his mother ($850 for cleaning, $x for ... (can't even read what it says)).

I wish that Cornell was sympathetic towards students. For those of you that have professors and classes being flexible and understanding, that's nice, but that hasn't been my experience at all. I feel strongly that the university should have switched to mandatory S/U because I can't even imagine what this would be like in a less privileged situation.

BoardsAndCards,"Everyone has been naming joke majors such as AEP and ILR as the hardest at Cornell. Even the most difficult of hotel school majors does not compare to the physical and emotional drain that is the physical education major. Do you know why Cornell requires two PE classes? It is so you can gain a glimpse of an understanding—an appreciation—of the difficulty of our major. You can barely handle the two classes that you are required to take. I take thirty a SEMESTER. Just to give you a glimpse of what it takes, I have a picture of a light freshman year schedule of 27 credits. Graduate students tremble at the rigor of PE 1300. Our problem sets are graded on our score—the B cutoff is a 290 average. I bet your single spare doesn't look too impressive now. You complain about your 9 ams, try my 6:15. Your day ends at 4? I'm not done until 11. If you thought that was difficult, many of us also do research on campus. While you are studying quantum field theory, I am studying track and field theory. You thought your post-labs were bad? Try my post workout.

Life_is_a_meme,"So my first year is ending here and all I can ask is if the average Cornell student knows how to use a bathroom without making the humanoid shaped organisms after you grab a gat and pop their head off.

Is it just my pod that apparently has never understood that when you pee all over the seat,  it doesn't magically become dry the next time you use it?

Why do people let their girlfriend's use the damn motherfucking bathroom? This damn guys lady keeps locking the fucking door doing God knows what in there. Nobody knows what she's doing that requires the bathroom to be locked for 30 minutes. I can't tell what she is doing from sounds because she keeps blasting the (personally) SHITTIEST music. I can hear this garbage from the stairways, and we're very far from the stairways. A few days ago it was some crappy EDM that I would vibe to if I was an edgy, prepubescent 11 year old. Today it was her shit country music, making me reminiscent of the times I would dance to Taylor Swift's old music. The closest girls bathroom is a five second walk, why do you gotta use mine?

The most infuriating feeling is when they walk out finally and they look at you as if ""what's this weirdo standing near the bathroom for"", while their equally incompetent boyfriend walks out.  Its amazing how a seat urinator dates a girl who makes a bathroom look as if it was eviscerated by a napalm bomb, with the toilet having some shit nuke all over the seat.

And there's this one guy who keeps singing in the damn bathroom, locking the door so he can shave his legs. Fuck you guy I'm next to the bathroom, I don't want to hear you singing every few days. The dude clogs the toilet because he keeps God damn putting an entire roll in the toilet. What the hell man?

I gagged yesterday due to wiping the seat (like I do every day). The only difference today was that my finger was molested by whatever nasty, foul, satanic sacrifice was under the seat.

Another fun time was when I put my pants on the floor, but was welcomed to a urine filled backside when I put my pants back on. I immediately took a shower, fearing that I would catch ebola and whatever carcinogens were discreetly hidden.

I honestly fear using the bathroom every day, and I often use the bathroom that is next to my RA due to whatever shit is happening that made me want to die. I don't want to clean up after these apparent ""smart enough to go to Cornell"" kids. 

Whenever bathroom maintenance comes, I truly feel safe in the bathroom.

I've complained to my RA before and when we brought up these complaints, I was met with ""yeah what's good with whoever is doing this"" all around. I then realized that these people are fucking snakes and that I was in a pod where I apparently was the only one who understood that pee on seat = bad and locking door = obviously stupid.

If I live with these people again, I'm going to castrate myself because my future children will be cursed forever, having to use the bathroom with my ""podmates"" hellspawns.

Can I expect that next year, people are a _little_ more hygenic? I didn't even think I was a stickler for hygiene. I'm actually the unhygienic person in my family, what the hell?

I live in Mews Hall, third floor, east section. If you know who I am, you've known my struggle, my cries for help, my chains. If you're my podmate, eat shit headass. Learn how to use a bathroom jackass, go to hell where I hope you will spend an eternity being forced to sit on urine ravaged toilets. And when you truly need to use the bathroom, it will be locked as you hear the screams of the devil behind the door.

That felt good to let out wew

Thankfully, there have been no ugly politics around such a common sense public health requirement. There are many vulnerable seniors and kids whom we have all, as a  community, managed to keep safe.

Many of you are indeed quarantining and wearing masks. Super kudos to you all! But still there are things we could do more.

For  the responsible folks out there -- do point out to the violators that  they should be wearing masks! I pointed out to two groups on the trail  and they immediately pulled them out from their pockets. Calling out  helps!

Triangulum_,"I need to rant about Cornell's handling of the COVID-19 situation. 

Cornell is a hard school, we know that, I decided to come here knowing that. I also enjoy my life at Cornell, I know that some people don't and that's cool too, I hope it gets better for them. This said, Cornell/Cornell Professors needs to have a little more flexibility in the current situation. The workload is not being reduced, in most of my classes it has been increased. I had three prelims over Thursday and Friday and two classes had assignments due Saturday night after the prelim just because they needed to get one more p-set in. I have done more work these past weeks at home than any of my time at Cornell before, when we were still at school this was an easier semester. I am lucky, my home life is fine and I have a space to work here, still this is a dumb amount of work. I can't imagine how hard this is for some people. Finally, having the pass/fail deadline due before the final is literally the dumbest thing on the planet. I understand that professors are probably trying to figure out how to navigate this now too, and I highly doubt I will get any grade estimates post prelim 2 before the final. There will literally be no basis for choosing pass/fail other than my hope that I'm doing well in one class versus another.

Anyways, I'm less mad now at the end of this, but it's still stupid. This is one of the best schools around, they should be able to handle this situation in a way that doesn't upset the entire student body.

igethebagfeat,"Basically my first semester at cornell was the best time of my life. Sure it was alot of work and some stress, I've made genuine friends here and I absolutely love most parts about the school.

This break, I realized why I love it so much and I honestly feel shitty for it.

I love it more because I'm away from my family. 

Small family, so we really 'rely' on each other. Guess in some way it can be taken as overbearing parents. Not academically, but just really really tight. mostly in a good way, but stressful nonetheless. 

I've never had this much freedom. My parents always gave me alot, but I've never taken advantage of it. being here with them basically stuck in this house is honestly frustrating. I already got into an argument with them earlier tonight. the worst part is that they are honestly wonderful and I know many would love to be part of a family like this.

I just miss the routine I developed there. Sure i have friends home too but honestly after making these cornell friends i dont really want to go back to some of my toxic 'friends'

I feel like an asshole wanting to get away from this family. I am blessed in so many ways and I feel ungrateful. My parents have been nothing but supportive all through my life but I just miss the independence I had there.

I took a lot of your advice and just acted natural and let the conversation flow. It was great and I feel a fuzzy sensation I've never felt before. I learned a lot about her dislikes and likes and about her family and she learned a bit about me as well. She wants to get together again sometime so now I've got to plan for a second meetup.

BoBigBed,"I understand that a lot of people are on Student Assembly because they either like to run for positions and/or have it on their resume, but why do you make the decisions you do? Decisions that are so baffling at times? You are the one student organization that can institutionally help students (although I also know the power the trustees wield). Why can't you advocate for students on the most basic of topics and act as an objective committee of oversight?

Let's start with the activity fee. A price hike on that, really? The cost hike itself isn't as problematic as the fact as there was no dissent--I'll bet that plenty of students would dissent to a price hike, especially in light of the tuition hike. It's disappointing that stuff like this just flies right on through as if it's trivial.

The whole issue with the Alliance for Science is incredibly disturbing too. SA immediately falls in line to support Julia Feliz when it's obvious that the details of what happened are not clear. Fellows within the program, from their respective Asian and African countries, pushed back against Feliz's allegations of discrimination and offered a very different perspective of what happened. Yet, the views of these individuals were effectively ignored in favor of confirmation bias and what SA deemed to be the ""truth"". They rushed through the vote of condemnation without even investigating what actually happened.

Suddenly, it’s as if my entire life, I’ve been living for that moment in the future when I would finally be successful, happy, and free. But after each longing day at Cornell, I’ve realized that this will never happen. Tomorrow is just going to feel like yesterday. My brain is finally realizing that I’ve wasted my childhood and teenage years in pursuit of something greater, telling myself that “college will be better” or “once I have my career,” I’ll be happy. But now that I’m here, there’s a crushing weight, that feels as though it will never let up. Now all I want to do is enjoy my life like a typical young adult but I can’t. It’s too late for that. In the pursuit of a better future, I’ve neglected the present. And I’m not alone. My closest friend at Cornell can’t even make the time to hang out with anyone anymore, including myself. Even while eating dinner with him, he has his air pods in and looks at his phone. My friend group has been torn apart by individual pursuits. No one is ever present.

,"So today, I, along with my 3200 freshman comrades, was delighted to learn I had a special package waiting for me at RPCC. Initially, I was shocked Father Bezos expediated my Amazon Prime textbook delivery by a day and mentally applauded him for Amazon's fast delivery times. But instead, to my dismay, the package was a book filled with essays written by upperclassman that every freshman received. And what a waste of paper that is. I'd be shocked if more then 10 people in our class actually read any of that. 

Now here's the problem: the book is 112 pages long and printed in color. So what? you may think. But wait:

112 pages \* \~3200 students = 358,400 pages

358,400 pages \* 0.25 dollars/page = $89,600

Environmental issues aside (granted this blatant waste should be addressed), if Cornell had its students pay for these books, we would have spent almost $90,000. And yet, they can't even give us free printing. 

If instead of spending ""$89,600"" (definitely less than this, but let me make my point), that money was given to students, we could have printed 995,556 pages in black and white. They just covered the costs of printing for every student for perhaps several years. Like, WTH Cornell???

Thanks for reading, I'm going to return to applying to project teams.

i try so hard to love this school and its leadership. I really do. and for the most part, I still hold Cornell in the highest regard because of all the experiences I have had there. But instances like these make it extremely hard to think well of any of the administration. there is not a single facet of their approach to coronavirus response that I could, in good faith, commend them for.

I understand that the situation is unprecedented. I understand that education has never been attempted in a format like this, with rules like these, ever before. But come on, Cornell. we are people and we are trying to figure out our lives as best we can. I have siblings and friends that go to much “less prestigious” schools who had their schedules and housing and travel and situations figured out MONTHS ago simply because their schools were prompt and concise in their pandemic response.

You check the dryer. Your clothes are gone. Confused, you wander outside to see if this is perhaps some cruel prank. Suddenly, the hair stands up on the back of your neck. The trees begin to rustle, but not the usual rustling of the leaves in the pre-autumn breeze. This feels... different.

Slowly, you turn your head. In horror, you see Martha herself swinging from tree to tree, draped in unfolded clothing, what you can only presume to be your missing laundry. She lets out a maniacal shriek, a shriek that must reach the very chambers of Gries above.

Before you can react, she lands a mere six feet in front of you. ""Do you play bridge?"" she cackles. At a loss for words, you only manage to stammer ""N-N-No."" She hisses, and throws down the cards she had been holding (was she holding those the whole time?) to the floor. You know enough about bridge to see that it was a bad hand.

It is silent now. The only sound is the rustling trees, and the cries of the congregating freshmen on the CKB quad. After what seems like the length of an exam, Martha begins to emit a low frequency hum. The hum slowly but surely increases to a deafening roar. You feel a warm fluid dribble down your legs. Piss.

Martha scoops you up in her underwear-clad arms, and carries you inside. You lock eyes with Pierre. In desperation, you plea for help, but he merely sighs and walks away, absorbing himself in his wastewater. Defeated, you make your body limp, and look on helplessly as Martha stuffs you into an open dryer.

Just as you're accepting your fate, Martha reaches into your pocket, removes your student ID, walks across the room, and swipes it through the reader. ""Nothing,"" she hisses, ""ever comes free.""

zikachu11,"I’ve noticed a ton of posts likely written by incoming freshmen panicking about dorms, accommodations, classes, etc. I just wanted everyone to know that not everyone has things sorted out by the first day of class.

Maybe you forgot your fan and there’s no AC in your dorm, maybe the PE you wanted filled up, maybe you don’t get to take the 30 credit semester you wanted to, maybe you’re panicking because someone else is taking 30 credits and you’re not doing that and thinking you’re a failure.

My point is that nothing will go perfectly, something in your first week at college will go wrong. It’s inevitable. And you’ll feel like crap.

Maybe some of you are coming from a place where your parents... cough... helicoptered your every move and controlled your life. Maybe you’re a little scared that you’re going to need to do things on your own. You definitely are, but there’s no point in stressing out about it. Things will 1) Work themselves out 2) Someone will help you 3) you’ll put in some elbow grease. 

You are surrounded by people who are working towards similar goals in life, who suffer through the same awkwardness in the first week or the same stress during finals week. You’ll learn from them.

If you’re a perfectionist (maybe you are, this is a school that attracts certain personalities), you’ll learn not to be. You’ll fuck up once, then again, and again, because you’re not in Kansas anymore. With great freedom comes great fuckups.

Don’t have a mental breakdown before your first day. You’ll have plenty of time afterwards for that.

teatherosie,"There’s this man from my country who earned an MA in Economics from Cornell ILR a while ago. Recently, he wrote a ridiculously stupid post on Facebook that simply blames racism against black people on their “laziness, drug addiction, raping, etc, and playing the race card to earn living allowances from the government”, generally shifting his argument towards black supremacy. The post, of course, has gone viral in my country and received very little agreement nor support. If this post is translated into English, I’m sure y’all would also be super mad reading it. 

As his post became popular, people started looking up his profile and found a series of articles published about him (since he was an accomplished scholar who received the prestigious Fulbright scholarship to go to Cornell). In a part of the article series, he talked about Cornell libraries. He said that Cornell is really large, and it has university libraries among the biggest ones in the world. He used to borrow “tons of books” from there and got “too lazy to return them as they are heavy to carry”. He also thought that “those who lend books to others are pure stupid, but those who got to borrow books and then return them are even more so”. When he graduated, as Cornell libraries asked for the books, he blatantly claimed that he had already returned them, that librarians were the ones to blame for not carefully checking the returned books. In the end, he got away with that and brought many books back to my country.

Besides stealing books from Cornell and glorifying that on published articles, he also used Cornell, and the Ivy League brand, to make money. He studied Economics in Cornell ILR and then Laws in Boston University. After graduation, he went back to my country and, instead of being a lawyer, founded an education business literally called “The Ivy League”. This business basically operates on prep classes for younger students who want to go to prestigious institutions in the US later. In another article besides the aforementioned one, he also claimed to have edited students’ essays from their initial ideas into completely new ones using his own ideas and “great imagination”, all in order to help make schools sympathize with their made up difficulties and give them more money. He has clearly made lots of money from this business, and people also put lots of faith in him given that he’s a Cornell scholar. I’m not sure if he’s been permitted to use the name of Cornell, or The Ivy League in general, for his for-profit business. I don’t know whether this is acceptable at all. 

So do you guys think this guy is worth reporting to Cornell? Does anyone know what the consequences would probably be? Also, how and who should I report this to, if any? Thanks in advance.

Angry_Tenant,"I let someone sublet my room this summer and it was a big mistake. I was desperate to find someone to sublet my place when I had to go home for covid since rent in Ithaca is expensive. One of my friends knew a girl who was looking for a place to stay for a month and she ended up staying most of the summer. I thought I lucked out. I met her in person and she seemed quiet and polite. My friend recommended her and vouched for her. So I let her sublet my apartment and I wrote a contract. She was looking at other places and I didn't want her to get dissuaded. My contract was short and simple. I had a security fee at first but she told me how she had a tough time with her parents financially and needed every penny she could get. I felt genuinely bad for her so I took it out. I also ended up paying the utilities (which wasn't much). She left in July and when I returned in August I was shocked. The entire room had trash, old food, food crumbs, random shit all over the floor. There were pin holes on three of my walls. There were stains on the mattress. Something sticky on a wall. It looked like she went through my stuff I left in a closet but nothing was taken. I called her and asked her what happened. She told me it was like that when she arrived. Which was a BIG FAT LIE. Luckily I did take a picture when I left. I sent the pics to her and told her that she needed to pay me for trashing my place. She blocked me soon after and she is taking the semester from home so I can't contact her. I spent an entire day with my friends cleaning it up and I still haven't gotten the stains of god knows what out of my mattress and part of my wall. Idk what to do about the pin holes. It was so dirty that I spent over fifty dollars at least in mops, gloves, and other equipment and theres a good chance my landlord might charge me for damages. BONUS: I went through her twitter feed and I found ""F\*\*\* LANDLORDS"" during the time she was subletting from me and some incoherent tweets about how she hates people owning land - capitalism - the system. And a recent tweet about how someone (my physical description) is trying to screw her over. I AM NOT A LANDLORD!!! and I actually tried to help her. A lot of the landlords in Ithaca are pretty shitty but this isn't the way to go. She baselessly thinks I'm rich - I'm not. Fuck her for ruining my place and being an asshole.

DatNeuroBioNerd22,"Hey Everyone,

As we get to that point of the new semester starting, I wanted to share just where I’m at and how I am handling things. 

One of the biggest takeaways I have had from this pandemic is the shear amount of apathy people have had about taking it seriously. I mean this from my hometown, where we ended up having an outbreak at one point because some kid wanted to go to Florida and party with a bunch of graduating seniors. While things have died down, looking back at peoples insta stories and snaps, I have no confidence that something like that can happen again. 

My best friends know this. I am super scared of getting sick in general, and covid comes with its own set of horrible side effects that are both long and short term. After my last post in this subreddit, I decided that I will stay home for the semester, despite losing my nice single, because it isn’t worth getting sick due to the apathy of others. I know people will say I am being paranoid or ignorant, but the stuff people in certain organizations have been doing.... yeah not cool. 

But why do I have regret? Because I’ll be missing all my senior friends even more. Being stuck at home for all this time has really worsened my anxiety and depression, to the point that I just. Feel totally unemotional at all times (numb) and the slightest fear makes me shake. It’s because being around a different setting makes me feel calmer. 

Moreover, being at home sucks when you want personal space. That’s what I have realized I miss the most. My parents often barge in, or there’s the constant sonorous sound of yelling, and in general, the berating I constantly get from my mom about my weight and my skin (I’m having breakouts).... all reasons I hate being home. Like. I love my parents, I love the food at home, and I love my room. But this other stuff is a lot. And I don’t want to be alone either. 

My brother is going back to school, and being at home with just my parents, I feel weird about it. Last semester, my parents began snooping on my grades, would walk in when I was testing, would walk in while I was presenting stuff, and yet still.... I would rather deal with all that than come back and certainly get sick. 

I’ve been to the Cayuga Medical Center, and I know they are wholly unequipped to deal with a potential outbreak at Cornell. And I know so many residents in Ithaca are older. I’ll miss the staff at New Delhi Diamonds, the kind boba geniuses at UTea, the incredible Mockingbird Paperie, and my love Angry Mom Records. But I don’t want to come back unless I know people will take this seriously. 

Why am I emphasizing this? My parents are both immunocompromised. In the event campus shuts down, I don’t want to come home and get them sick. I have cried and cried over this decision because my heart breaks. I miss Ithaca so much- never did I think I would find my home till I came to Cornell... and leaving home is not easy. I’ll miss my stuff I put in storage, the decor and beyond that makes my room my room. I’ll miss the libraries and the hill and the clock tower and the observatory. And most of all I’ll miss the people. But sadly this is where I am. 
I know this post was long, but I wanted to pen the thoughts I’ve had for a while. To share them. Because I know I’m not alone in my line of thinking. I also know I am not the best writer- I tried my best. 

Please reach out if you are feeling this way too- I want to share my support to everyone. 

Most of all- to all the professors and staff at Cornell, as well as the residents of Ithaca- I’ll miss you all incredibly so. You guys are amazing, and you make ithaca special. I hope you stay safe, and thank you for all your hard work. I promise I’ll be back soon.","Decisions, Regret, COVID",141,0.95,i7wwaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/i7wwaw/decisions_regret_covid/,15,1597198514.0,2020-08-11 21:15:14

In fact, many of my peers are Viking and I can't help but notice how many of them come from a more powerful clan than my peers in high school. Everyone knows the stereotype of rich Ålesund/Faroe students, but I've noticed than many Ostrobothnian-born Viking students also come from relatively powerful raiding squads here, and can be fairly entitled in how they act.

Does anybody have any insights into the ""Viking princess"" stereotype here at cornell?",Viking Princesses,137,0.88,a7gq5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/a7gq5f/viking_princesses/,3,1545205513.0,2018-12-19 01:45:13

kimagureprince,"Dear god please listen to your gut.

I pretty much came to Cornell not wanting to be in my major but just swallowed that feeling and made myself bear it. It wasn’t until halfway into my third semester in engineering, doing miserably in my first few “real” engineering courses, that I finally accepted that I was not enjoying anything about being at school, and being in engineering in the first place was the result of a lot of convincing that it was the right choice for me and would benefit me the most.

I came up with a speech for my parents for when I told them about my decision to switch. They took it about as poorly as I had expected and prepared for. That was probably the first real “adult” thing I did, standing up for myself and really doing what I want to do.

I am so, so much happier in my new major. Did you know that classes aren’t just an obligation and are fun even when you’re doing terribly because you’re interested in the material? Wack!

If you’re not happy in your major, don’t be like me and waste all that time doing something you don’t love. Having to cram all my new classes (major and premed) into almost half the number of semesters as other students is so stressful and gives me less opportunity to explore classes outside my major. I’m currently taking autotutorial biochem and genetics lab+lecture. Don’t ask me how I’m doing.

Please let yourself be “selfish” while in college, it’ll save you this headache. Plus tuition is too expensive to be studying something you don’t love for a job you don’t want.",To any freshmen having doubts about how much they actually like their current major,139,0.99,ixf5ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/ixf5ei/to_any_freshmen_having_doubts_about_how_much_they/,16,1600771689.0,2020-09-22 05:48:09
VeritasEngineer,"Hey everyone, there have been a significant increase in the number of posts related to violations of the student behavioral compact and we wanted to clarify the subreddit posting guidelines.

First and most importantly, the health and well-being of the community is the highest priority. We all want Cornell to remain open as a safe environment and in order for that to happen everyone should be following the behavioral and distancing guidelines that every member of our community has signed. 

However, repetitive posting about parties on this subreddit does not help achieve that. Instead of spamming threads often full of unverified information or bad advice, please use the following resources:


# Reporting #

If you see students or large gatherings that are not following the behavior compact and proper social distancing guidelines:

* Cornell Online Reporting Form: [located here](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?CornellUniv&layout_id=80)
* Tompkins County Sheriff Non-Emergency Number: (607) 273-8000

Important reminders:

* Use common sense. DO NOT CALL AN EMERGENCY LINE (911) for reporting a party. 
* This subreddit is also not the appropriate place to report this behavior. 

# COVID Testing and Resources #

* Cornell Tracker Dashboard: [located here](https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/dashboard/)
* Tompkins County Health Department Statistics: [located here](https://tompkinscountyny.gov/health) 
* Testing information at Cornell: [located here](https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/)
* Questions or discussion about taking a COVID test or results: [MegaThread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/idfc9w/fall_2020_return_to_campus_megathread/)

# Clarification of subreddit policies#

* Because posting here about a party is not helpful, these posts are not allowed and will be removed. DO NOT post that you just saw Student John Smith or Fraternity Alpha Alpha not following distancing guidelines. If you see troubling behavior then please help fix the situation by using the resources listed above instead. DO POST here for general discussion and conversations about the compact, compliance, etc. 

* Related to the above point, posts that are singling out a specific student(s) will be removed. Posting of personally identifiable information (e.g. name) is already a violation of Reddit and /r/Cornell rules and that remains true now. This subreddit is not for encouraging toxic behavior against other community members. REPORT THEM and move on.

chobani-,"Hey all, Class of 2018 here. I went through the Cornell grind as a Chemistry major, had the ego beat out of me, and graduated with a truly mediocre GPA (3.3/4.0). I had a legitimate reason for why my grades were so bad in the one semester that tanked my overall GPA, but that doesn’t matter now. 

My goal was grad school, specifically a PhD. I had both deans and an advisor tell me that I had little to no chance because my record was so unspectacular. And I definitely felt that was true - in my graduating year, we had several students with 4.0+ GPAs. But I decided, fuck that - I was going to make my dreams happen. So I graduated, worked for two years in a top lab to get more experience, and just applied this cycle. 

I’ve already been accepted to two top-10 PhD programs, including an Ivy, with full funding. One of those schools even said that they usually didn’t accept anyone with a GPA under 3.5. I see a lot of posts here about students worried because they did poorly in one class or one semester. There’s a light at the end of the Cornell tunnel for those of you looking into grad school, even if you feel like your record isn’t the best/you’re not the most competitive applicant on paper.

1. Pedestrians - Please do not jaywalk in front of a car and expect them to be able to instantly stop for you. Some girl did this to me outside Klarman and I had to swerve to avoid hitting her. Keep in mind I was going only 10 MPH. 
2. Drivers - Please be careful on hills - especially those with crosswalks at the end of them. Additionally, do not floor your car from stops and drive slower around campus. Remember, hitting an icy speedbump at a high speed will cause you to lose control. Be mindful around pedestrians also- they are super unpredictable. DO NOT ASSUME AWD WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE YOU; HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE WHEN THE SNOW IS TOO MUCH FOR YOU TO HANDLE.
