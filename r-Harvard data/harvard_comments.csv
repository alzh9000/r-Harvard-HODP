There are expenses such as housing and meals that aren't factored into the price of HES, of course, but compared to the $273,320 it costs to complete a degree at the college, or the $222,204 that an MBA will cost you (housing and fees included per the link provided above), it would be alarming for an HES student to spend as much for their degree as someone at one of the aforementioned schools.",12,,False,fl6pa5j,False,False,1584878765.0,2020-03-22 07:06:05

Comparing various online streaming options,Gzideck,"> But isn't the primary entrance requirement for acceptance at the Extension School the ability to write a check for $58,880?

My issue with this argument is that HES offers full financial aid to those who need it, and in certain circumstances (as far as I'm aware), will refund the cost of the 3 entry classes once you're admitted if you demonstrate through your aid application that it was a significant financial strain for you. I'd say (anecdotally) that 1/20 people at the university (outside of HES) that I meet don't consider HES ""real Harvard"", and their argument is always that the barrier to entry at HES is the financial commitment. If that's the case, is an HES degree of someone receiving aid more legitimate than one who is paying their way through?

You're trying to put shame behind students carrying the name ""Extension School"" on their degree which is wholly unnecessary. As an HES student, I see people all the time in my program who try to pass off their studies as being from the college or another graduate schools, which I find appalling. The idea that our degree is any less legitimate than any other student at the university's is mainly perpetuated by people outside the university, in my experience. A grandparent of mine with a degree from the university considered it legitimate, my family friends with degrees from the university consider it legitimate, the person I'm dating at the college considers it legitimate, the people I meet and become friends with outside of HES at the university consider it legitimate (going as far to tell me to stop adding on ""Extension School when people ask me where I go to school). Are all these people (who have no reason to lie to me, and have a track record of being brutally honest with me) systemically lying to me, even though they have no reason to?

Nobody has to buy their way into the Extension School, because HES is one of the least selective bachelor degree programs out there. For all intents and purposes, everyone gets accepted to the program. A couple of years ago, a high school student got his degree from HES before he finished high school.

What Was Your Most Satisfying H-Bomb Drop Moment ?,pinkstardust007,"Oh I have a good one! My family moved from Croatia to the US when I was 12 and we ended up living in a white picket fence suburb filled with trophy wives. Our next door neighbor, a woman in her early 30s married to a 70 year old, was so uncomfortable about our Croatian family living next door to her as if we were literal aliens. 

She would go as far as calling the HOA people and say things like ""people from the Balkans are all aggressive, it's not a good look for us to have them here"" or she would question how we could afford living in that neighborhood and insinuate that my parents were involved in illegal activities. 

Fast forward to my high school graduation when my best friend, who lived on the same street as us, and I decided to have a joint graduation party at my place. We invited everyone from our street and my parents (known for their wonderful Croatian hospitality) didn't want to single out the rude trophy wife so they invited her and her family as well. She actually came alone, probably because she's nosy and wanted more gossip material, and got into a discussion about colleges with my best friend and her dad, while I stood next to them eating my hot dog. 

She was saying how happy she was that my friend got into Columbia and how it's nice that some schools still have standards (my best friend is the typical rich girl coming from generational wealth with a fairly well known last name). She couldn't brag about her own college success because she didn't attend college so she mentioned that her step son is getting his PhD at Harvard. My best friend knew how that woman had treated my family for so long, and considering the obnoxious comment on standards she had just made, my friend decided to drop the H bomb for me.

""Oh, really? Pinkstardust007 is going to Harvard, too. Yeah, she's one of the 2 graduates from our school who got in.""

Personally, the only 'satisfying moment' I had was when I let my father know that I'll be pursuing and finishing a degree from Harvard - because he was never that supportive of my capabilities in school nor cared, he never went to college yet used to laugh at people who didn't stay in school (quite the hypocrisy) and most of all - my whole life he belittled me for being 'dumber'. He always treated me as if I was incompetent simply because I couldn't find the tool he wanted me to (even though it was never where he thought it was).

Letting him know that I'm going to do well at a great university was not something I wanted to say to necessarily spite him - but I wanted him to know he was wrong about me. And that I did this without his help.",50,,False,g0eb644,False,False,1596589655.0,2020-08-04 20:07:35
What Was Your Most Satisfying H-Bomb Drop Moment ?,geoduri,"A few years ago, i was working overseas and while having dinner with other expats, the topic of ethnicity came up. I told them I'm Filipino and was born and raised in the Philippines and didn't move to the US until I was in my teens. Another expat asked this guy from Hawaii if he is also Filipino and he said he identifies as white (even though his entire family is ethnically Filipino). He then started to berate Filipinos and said how he cannot identify with them because all they do is send money back home, buy a shit load of spam and send it in balikbayan boxes. (while this is definitely very common for Filipinos to do, I don't see anything wrong with it since it's their money and why does he care?) Anyway, after the dinner, i opened my wallet and he saw my Harvard ID. He then asked in front of everyone, ""you went to Harvard?""

I spun around to face them. ""Retard?"" I said, ""Retard? I'll have you know that I am a student of none other than the great Harvard herself.""

Their laughter stopped. You could have heard a pin drop. Then, one old man started clapping slowly in his feeble and elderly fashion.

I agree . In fact people can be hired for the mainstream professions without having to attend college. 

I re read my post and it seems that the post was communicating a different idea which I did not intend : I am *for* people having an easy time finding and working in any profession they desire to pursue. It is indeed true that many of the ""other"" professions and even the ""not-other"" professions are accessible (or ought to be) to people willing to contribute to society.

If you wanted a good undergraduate education you wouldn't go to any major research University, you would go to a smaller College. If undergraduate instruction is what you want, then you should be at a school like Williams. Research Universities serve to advance research, and the real money is spent on faculty doing research. Undergraduate education is generally consider a lower priority than publishing papers.

Students attend Harvard for two things: (1) the cachet of the name on the diploma (and from a pure economic utility standpoint the admission letter should have the same value) (2) the political and economic connections one makes on campus. A small number of students also connect to and benefit from direct research opportunities while undergrads, but its not required, hard to do, and only a minority of students do this.

Remote learning undercuts both of these. #2 is clearly lost, but #1 is undercut as people start to question the value of college degrees in general.

I really dislike arguments like that:

1. It ignores that this is about what we make families pay to give their children opportunities and instead frames it as what we make the student pay. I didn't pay for my education, my dad did. (To be even more technical the federal government did through my mother's Social Security benefits that my father diligently saved on my behalf.)

2. It doesn't distinguish between the millionaire class, the multi-millionaire class and the billionaire class. The impact of these means testing programs on families who are saving for college is markedly different. For those in the first group it means meaningful sacrifice, for those in the last it's nothing.

3. In this particular case it is problematic because it ignores the issue of the promised value for money. Any individual who is paying has the right to ask if they are getting what they were promised, even if the relative impact of that broken promise is less. To argue that this isn't wrong in some fashion, is to take the position that the wealthy can be ripped off on any commercial transaction, because it is a relatively smaller impact on them. So sell them a lemon of a car, serve them watery coffee, etc... Nobody appreciates being ripped off.

To your first point, I would clarify that I used the term student and family interchangeably in this context. Regardless, I’m not entirely convinced that it matters who the burden falls upon. The calculation for the expected contribution accounts for both the family and the student wealth.

Point 2, I agree that for those in the millionaire class, $200,000 for four years at Harvard can certainly be a large sum of money. However, I still stand by my original statement. Meaningful sacrifice for a millionaire can mean many things. It may be taking out a larger home mortgage, or it may mean fewer overseas vacations for a while. Whatever it manifests as, it is not as meaningful of a sacrifice as a low income student who’s family may sacrifice a meal, an auto repair, a bill payment, or any number of things. The point being that the students benefiting from financial aid are mostly those who cannot afford to make meaningful sacrifices. Those who have the privilege of millionaire level wealth may lose comforts, they may not live as extravagantly, but they are never going to be put to the brink of homelessness or financial ruin because of the cost of Harvard for their child.

As for point 3, I do understand your argument, but I think that it is a leap to say that what is sold is not what is promised. My understanding is that Harvard will still be continuing its liberal time off policy. Any student can choose to leave the college until classes resume in person. If a student believes that the $50,000 tuition is not worth it for online classes, they can hold on the transaction until it becomes worthwhile.

> A significant portion of teaching for the first few years is done not by professors but by their graduate students.

I'm a senior and I have literally never been in a class that was taught by a grad student. Sure, they run sections and grade assignments -- but the teaching has always been done by the prof (who has also usually had extensive office hours and been very responsive to email). 

> As for thesis it is a very different situation than being actively incorporated into a professors ongoing research activities. 

This is again not true in my experience. When I was searching for a thesis advisor, they were all very explicit about only being interested in advising theses that pertained to their areas of research. 

> At smaller colleges that do not offer graduate programs students can be incorporated into the professors ongoing research as if they were graduate students (in fact they have to be because the professor has no graduate students).

I never said I thought it was ""clear"", but I think it raises the question, and I don't know if elite institutions are prepared to answer the questions raised. How do you answer the question ""What makes a Harvard Graduate better than an X graduate?"" Does your answer rely in some way on classroom instruction? Or opportunities outside the classroom? How are those impacted by remote learning? Is Harvard really the best prepared for transitioning to remote learning, or will there be better outcomes for institutions that have focused on ""mass production"" of higher education and have prior experience with remote learning?

> Sure, they run sections and grade assignments -- but the teaching has always been done by the prof 

I'm sure it varies by department, but my feeling is that the real learning was from the section, not the lecture. For the record I was a math major, and the real instruction on how to make mathematical arguments was in the detailed feedback we got from the grad students who graded our proofs, not the lectures where we learned the material.

In later years there would be a big difference between a course taught by a non-tenured professor and tenured faculty. If you could get a tenured professor teaching a course relevant to their area of study... it would be an amazing course, with constant nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout. On the other hand non-tenured faculty had to teach the course and would do so adequately, but you could tell their focus was on their own research not on the instruction.

> cost of having 'ongoing research' that is not interesting/rigorous enough to require grad students

That certainly is a valid criticism of schools like Williams at least in my field. Most Harvard math majors graduate having completed most of the coursework required of PhD programs in advance of prelims. Whether or not that is actually valuable is a different question entirely.

As someone who can proudly admit to completing an ABD, I can say its absolutely useless. Could have saved a few years and a lot of grief by being guided through some research as an undergrad and realizing it wasn't my future.",1,,1594090816.0,fx61cu7,False,False,1594090268.0,2020-07-06 21:51:08

we appreciate your support, but do not use this as an excuse to bully dalbert. we’re all flawed and learning how to do better, and he deserves that same chance.“

Respectfully, this has already not been the case. The family of the girl who was the first patient in St. Louis has already had to retain a lawyer (in part due to her dad dropping her off at home and continuing about his day like he would a regular sick teenage/college-age daughter, not a young lady who just came back from an international trip in a scary time). She’s been identified online, and her reputation is being destroyed in her community, in Facebook comments, and even here on Reddit. She’s only nineteen/twenty, and she’s a current student who will undoubtedly be Googled by future employers. Her little sibling was named as well; their full name, grade, and school was posted by alarmists. The fact that the family is wealthy won’t really shelter them much, especially since parents at the sibling’s school are already planning to sue the dad for his disregard for their children.

Juneteenth,tamirabeth," Dear Members of the Harvard Community,  
 

On this Friday, June 19, the University will be closed to commemorate Juneteenth. All faculty and staff will have a full day of paid time off. If you must work that day to support essential operations, your efforts will be acknowledged with other paid time off.  
 

Long celebrated as an Independence Day in the African American community, Juneteenth marks the day—155 years ago this year—that enslaved African American people in Texas were told of their freedom from bondage. It offers a moment to acknowledge and celebrate the promise of a new beginning, and I cannot imagine a better year for Harvard to begin recognizing its significance. These are extraordinary times distinguished by extraordinary displays of passion and resolve. We are everywhere reminded of the possibility of something different—something better—for our communities, our states, and our nation, as well as the deep reflection and hard work getting there will require of all of us.  
 

Throughout the week, the *Harvard Gazette* will be featuring [related coverage and resources](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/series/the-quest-for-racial-justice/), and I encourage you to learn more about the many ways in which members of our community are advancing the cause of racial justice in America. Each of us has a role to play in considering the past and the present as we work together to imagine our future, and I am proud to undertake that important—and essential—work with all of you.  
 

All the best,  
Larry

“Another edit: we’re looking at legal and moral options. the goal is to find a balance of getting credit for our work and not crushing dalbert in the process. i think what a lot of the more extreme people on this sub are missing is that although what he did is absolutely reprehensible, he’s also just a kid. all that he’s probably seen of startups is tense and dramatic movies/shows, so this might just feel like part of the deal to him. i think we can all take this as a learning experience and not a punitive one, getting our credit, being more careful in the future, and hopefully for dalbert, understanding the importance of actual collaboration.

we appreciate your support, but do not use this as an excuse to bully dalbert. we’re all flawed and learning how to do better, and he deserves that same chance.“

I thing he is spot on. Obviously what he did is reprehensible, but at the end of the day he is just a dumb kid. He didn’t kill/rape/kidnapped someone, his mistake is purely ethical and moral.

That classes as HES are not like that in my opinion. With the exception of one class, all my classes followed a normal schedule of weekly meetings, papers, Zoom session, breakout groups, etc.

I think the type of online education you are describing would frustrate me to no end. While the online technology environment has transferred from HES, I think some teaching lessons and methods have not. TBH, it has got to be hard on instructors & TF's making the shift online also.

Hang in there, and provide honest feedback. As the greenhorn-to-online-learning profs get some experience, and embrace constructive criticism, it will get better.  IMO, in addition to the technical experience HES provided the other schools of HU, they should have had the top 10 HES instructors teach “How to teach via Zoom” classes to all the newbs.

How about you go first.  You can confess all your sins right here in this thread.

Even if Harvard doesn't go to the waitlist, the synergy of the class is so extremely important (as a result of the fact that it is the main consideration which allows the admissions committee to choose one of every dozen or so qualified applicants) that what this guy did damaged his merit beyond repair by virtue of merely damaging Harvard's ability to *trust* in his commitment to tolerance and diversity.

Additionally, the fact of the matter is the school simply can't know if the guy's changed. In his letter, he continues to refer to the shooting as an event which critically changed his perspective, and his response to it as evidence of this changed perspective, but nowhere does he explain how the event or his response were meaningfully specific to values of diversity and tolerance, which I suspect is a major reason why Harvard rescinded him.",21,,False,erf99kh,False,False,1560802980.0,2019-06-17 15:23:00

However, I do think the discovery of this information during the interim period makes this decision much more difficult. 

Had this information been discovered during the initial review of Kyle’s application, Harvard’s citation of their right to deny anyone for any reason would be a perfectly satisfactory explanation in my view. However, I personally view that offers of admission should only be rescinded when information reflecting a negative change in an individual’s character *relative to the initial review of their application* is presented. Obviously this is just my personal opinion, and does not conflict with Harvard’s right to deny anybody for any reason, but I think that reasoning becomes less legitimate if someone has already made steps to adjust their character to match that of the Harvard community. 

However, as you correctly pointed out, Kyle did a fairly poor job at demonstrating how he’s changed. Even if a change in a candidate’s character is redeemable based on when the candidate initiated such change, I still question whether the magnitude of change was satisfactory in Kyle’s case.

If the document was shared amongst kids we assume were friends, it’s more than likely there was more than just one person saying these “shocking” things. Jokes amongst friends usually don’t go reported to institutions/social media/etc typically because the members of the group realize that what is said is being said in jest, not as a reflection of a racist viewpoint. My point isn’t about any oath of secrecy between friends, it’s that friends realize what is racism and what is a joke. If you spill “Hey; Kyle said the N-word” to Harvard, they don’t think it’s anything like a joke.

I understand that this could even mean that: Kyle was in a google doc with his friends and used the n word in a genuinely racist way, but his friends were horrified by him, but withheld that information until exactly the right time between acceptance and matriculation where he would be maximally screwed.

With all of that being said, I'm not upset that they get to pursue higher education at top universities without the world knowing what they did. Today's cancel culture is brutal and everything is set in stone, or on Twitter. No matter how much a person apologizes and how hard they commit to changing themselves, very few people will see it as genuine and their name will forever be tied to something moronic they said online. Although change and education should be something you do for yourself, not for the sake of restoring your reputation, clearing your name is still important for any future endeavors. Harvard was absolutely right to cut ties with them, I supported that decision back then and I support it now, just like I support the anonymity of those involved. 

Don't get me wrong, being 17 doesn't excuse their behavior, especially in today's world. But I think it's okay that they got to move on, all we can do now is hope that being told to fuck off by Harvard was a learning experience.

It's worth revisiting the Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017...,Pontefract2,">**Premise 2:**  
>  
>It can be reasonably assumed that this poster used the phrase ""ruining someones life"" in reference to Harvard's rescindment of admission, and the associated fallout -- regardless of exaggeration, no one can deny that these are serious consequences (whether or not you believe they were enough or too much).Conclusion:This poster would like to live in a society where \[blatantly racist behavior\] does not \[bring about significant negative consequences\].This is what we have freedom of speech for! Say it proudly -- there's no need to hide behind vague statements and concepts, tell us all where you really stand :)

It seems obviously wrong that ""ruining someone's life"" was used in reference to rescinding Harvard admission.

The poster said ""...am pretty fine with them still getting to have a life... "" which first introduces the idea of ""having a (presumable not ruined) life"" in the context of attending another, non-Harvard school. Also, nowhere in the post does he seem to condemn Harvard rescinding admission, in fact he brings up the positive point of the student getting to reflect on their wrong actions. So it is incorrect to assume he is against Harvard rescinding at all.

In the context of the post, ""ruining someone's life"" would be better considered as preventing the student from subsequently attending \*any\* highly ranked school. The poster seems fine with them having the serious consequence of having a ""fucking Harvard admission"" rescinded. Consequently, your conclusion does not follow.",0,,1598817925.0,g3e3dbx,False,False,1598817314.0,2020-08-30 14:55:14

It's also a bummer that most students were told they can't attend because social distancing would be a problem - and now anyone not a student can come onto campus and not socially distance during this time.

Riverbend Park is right nearby on Mount Auburn, Mount Auburn Cemetery is amazing and huge and close-by and open for walking, plus the walking area all along the Charles, plus Cambridge Common, etc. Then you have the Fresh Pond not too far away with a lot of walking space.

Yes, which is why if you want to get on the z-list, you also have to make a substantial donation.  IIRC, Jared Kushner, a mediocre student (who isn't even a legacy student) got in due to a 2 million dollar donation from his father.  Harvard is corrupt to its core.

I'm happy to report that it does in fact get better - I can't speak for the current COVID-modified freshman experience, but classes, clubs, entryways, random encounters, etc. all slowly give you friends and familiar faces without you even realizing it. Of course there will be ups and downs, but don't loose sight of the fact that a lot of the ""friend groups"" that exist this early on are probably just circles of acquaintances from Visitas - this may sound dumb but the only way I've ever been able to rationalize those weird early Visitas friend groups is by thinking of them sort of of like micelles: balls of lipids that spontaneously orient and clump purely because of their hydrophobicity (i.e., people just don't want to be alone and group up with whomever they can). Not a bad thing, but I don't know how many life-long friends are made during the first week of school. It takes time to find real friends, and it doesn't stop after freshman fall either. 

The start of school can be a difficult time for just about everyone from a social perspective. I'm sure you've heard and read things to that effect just about everywhere, but I think there are some odd factors at harvard that complicate the matter - ego and expectations of a grand experience can lead to let-downs and feelings of missing out.

Everyone I know at HC or any HU school finds their 'group' through just going to events and clubs or just hanging out in the Yard...but that's during a normal year.

This year that's *way* different. Much less students and a lack of student events or in-person clubs isn't helping.

So if it takes a little longer for you to find your 'group', don't be down on yourself. It's just a very unique year, to say the least.

Most everyone I know has gone back home in the Spring and didn't return to campus this semester  - so I'm always hanging out alone on campus, too. And it can often look like everyone has their group. So I understand.

But just remember this is only the first week and more importantly - the first week of a type of year that Harvard has *never* seen before.

You'll find people.

Justice Department sides with Asian-Americans suing Harvard over admissions policy,Lareine,"I respectfully disagree.

Harvard is approximately 15% Asian-American.  The US is approximately 5% Asian-American.

Harvard is approximately 6% Black.  The US is approximately 12% Black.

Say it's your job to detect the most exceptional students in the population.  Which seems more plausible - that Asian-Americans are 3x more naturally gifted than the average person, and Black Americans are 2x *less* gifted?  Or that social structures make it harder for an exceptional Black student to demonstrate their abilities in traditional ways?


I believe that:

(a) If exceptional people come from all races/genders/religions with equal probability, and group differences are a reflection of societal failings, a college should strive to accept the best students from each group.

(b) College education goes way beyond the classroom, and a diverse student body leads to a better education for everyone.


Accepting fewer Asian-Americans and fewer white students, *as a percent of those that apply*, is an incredibly logical approach to building the most talented student body and the best educational environment.

This lawsuit was never solely about harvard. Harvard is a placeholder for all schools that engage in this behavior. 

If scotus dropped the hammer on harvard via title vi, IMO harvard would go the hillsdale route to preserve the quota system they currently use.

It's been a while since I applied to college, I graduated in 2012 but I don't think admissions have changed that much.

Most competitive schools accept three metrics to evaluate merits of admissions. Two quantitative, the SAT and GPA. And another metric qualitative, the personal score which consists of what you listed above. 

Here are the facts. Asian Americans as an applicant pool are above the mean in the quantitative metrics. Asian Americans have been applying to Harvard in greater numbers. Asian Americans as a percentage of the incoming class have not reflected this change.

So what is stopping Harvard from admitting more of these applicants? Is it a quota that the admissions office is trying to target in the percentage of incoming Asian Americans or is it the qualitative metric that disadvantages these applicants?

If we see that Asian American applicants have been becoming more competitive in the two quantitative metrics but are not becoming more competitive in overall admissions. All things being equal, this points to a racial bias.

As for your question of legacy admits. In a system based on equality of opportunity, of course I do not believe that should be an advantage. What I think is fair and what I think will happen are two very different things. ",12,,False,e54yu1u,False,False,1535687848.0,2018-08-30 22:57:28

Or because other more qualified applicants determined by the qualitative measures are being accepted. Not because the qualitative measures are broken.

Nothing here points to racial bias yet. Do you have any evidence that Asian American applicants are ""becoming more competitive in the two quantitative metrics""? Curious. But for all we know, other applicants could be also be becoming more competitive in those measures at the same rate. We already know the school all around is becoming more competitive every year.

We don't know anything about the rest of the growing applicant pool and their increasing qualifications from it. We do know Harvard is getting more competitive all around.

We do know Harvard looks at race so there is 'racial discrimination' in that sense. The law is confusing about this epitomized by this quote:

""The Supreme Court has said universities cannot build a freshman class with specified percentage targets for each racial group, but it has allowed universities to consider race as a factor in admissions to obtain the benefits of a diverse student body.""

However is Harvard limiting Asians with racial intention? I don't see evidence for this. They do claim Asians just rank low on their qualitative criteria. It would be good to compare it to other groups. However, its reasonable to assume that a larger than normal percentage of Asians apply to Harvard than the members of other racial groups so in that case the result would not be surprising.",1,,False,e55vhsw,False,False,1535731686.0,2018-08-31 11:08:06
Justice Department sides with Asian-Americans suing Harvard over admissions policy,dukie5440,"Your takeaway from that article was that it argues there is a growing population of Asians in the US?  Of course that doesn't prove discrimination, it was one aspect to consider as they continued on to cover how thoroughly Asian Americans have dominated the top of the quantitative measures. Compared to their population, they are outrageously over represented in becoming national merit semifinalists. 

You choose to ignore the sharp drop in admissions during certain years and then subsequent years maintaining those decreased admission percentages with little deviation.

I even capitulated that you don't have to believe the argument. But to look at these statistics and argue that there is no basis for which racial discrimination in regards to admissions can exist is stubborn. Harvard asked the DOJ to throw this case out. How can we progress as a society if powerful institutions, particularly gatekeepers of future power aren't even willing to discuss if equality of opportunity is being fairly administered.  That is how policies like affirmative action ever made it to the table. 

Perhaps most telling is your belief that admissions are justified because you believe Asian Americans must score lower in the personal score section.  Yes, that's what I've been saying this whole time. This personal score section allows the admissions department great leeway in how they wish to shape the incoming class.

Do you really believe these high achieving applicants aren't able to craft personable essays? That they are somehow coming off worse to admissions readers in their teacher recommendations? Do you believe that as a whole Asian Americans just bomb the alumni interviews?

You choose to to ignore or brush aside the possibility of racial discrimination in the face of statistical evidence, yet are quick to believe that Asians must score lower in the personal score therefore justifying current admissions percentages in the face of zero evidence minus the result itself.  I think that tells me enough about how you really feel about equality of opportunity.

As far as I can see Harvard's acceptance rate has been decreasing every year except a slight bump up in 2018. So, when exactly where these decreasing admission percentages calculated?

\> Do you really believe these high achieving applicants aren't able to craft personable essays? That they are somehow coming off worse to admissions readers in their teacher recommendations? Do you believe that as a whole Asian Americans just bomb the alumni interviews?

We know that though Asians represent 6% of the US, they are represented by 22% within Harvard. It's highly likely a higher percentage of Asians apply relative to their racial size than other groups in the US. It's absolutely likely that those applicants were not nearly as good as the other candidates in those qualitative measures - and maybe quantitative measures. Of course, each student has a diverse mix of these.

It seems Asians do rank well on 'objective' measures (like test scores and grades) but to assume non-racial considerations like personal statements, interviews, etc., are marked incorrectly is not firm.

- Vice President (Boudou) is involved in many corruption cases (influence peddling, conspiracy, money laundering, etc)
- President of the tax collection agency (named Echegaray) is involved in many corruption cases, including conspiracy (together with Boudou) and influence peddling
- Ex minister Felisa Micheli is involved in at least one corruption case (there was a bag with ARS 100.000 and USD 31.000 hidden in the bathroom where she worked)
- Ex minister Ricardo Jaime is is involved in many corruption cases (he used an airplane Learjet of an enterprise he was in charge of controlling)
- A man flying from Venezuela (Antonini Wilson) brought 800k dollars to support her campaign
- Etc.

You could also ask why is she encouraging people of her political party, to indoctrinate schoolchilds to support her. In Buenos Aires it is forbidden by the law. 

Why is Argentina blocking so many lawsuits from retirees against the state? There is a stock of 400.000 , about 80.000 new lawsuits per year, the mayority of them are dying before they can receive the money they claim. Argentina has committed to the Organization of American States, not to appeal those cases when there is jurisprudence from the Supreme Court (the Supreme Court has already failed against the Argentina State). At the same time, the government is using the retirees money to support other enterprises.

She is a very good lyar. Don't trust her a word. She will probably say that people in Argentina is free to travel abroad, that's not true, since the mayority of people is not allowed to buy dollars and if they travel, they can be prosecuted by the tax collection agency that operates as a political prosecution agency.

To anyone attending 9/27 public address by Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner,_Jason_,"Argentina has become a cheap imitation of Chavez's totalitarian regime. She is boosting consumption through rampant inflation and tight restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency. As a result, more and more companies are closing down because it is hard for them to manufacture goods if they need imported materials. CFK is not fostering local production and employment. Her administration is totally based on political machine and patronage. All her cronies are getting richer and richer while the middle class is sinking more and more into poverty. 
CFK is looting retirement and pension funds to finance her political clientelism. She is currently paying pre-teens and teenagers an allowance for every child they have, so the more babies these kids bring forth, the more money they get. Who would want to work if nanny state provides for their negligence? All of this is courtesy of law-abiding ARgentine tax-payers. 
Furthermore, CFK is fostering illegal immigration into Argentina in exchange for votes. The rate of arrests among illegal aliens (mainly colombians, peruvians, mexicans, and dominicans) has grown exponentially.  
On the other hand, lack of safety in cities and suburbs has overwhelmed an underpaid and underfunded police force. There are more constitutional safeguards for criminals than for law-abiding citizens. 
On the international front, she is building alliances with autocratic, fundamentalist and tyrannical regimes that constitute a serious threat to world peace and stability (e.g. Angola, Venezuela, Cuba, and Iran, respectively).
There is widespread corruption. The Vice President owns the company that prints Argentine currency. Most government officials (1) live in the most exclusive areas of Buenos Aires; (2) own real estate abroad; and (3) are allowed to purchase as many US dollars are they please to deposit them in tax heavens. 
The secretary of domestic trade keeps a gun on the desk during his interviews.... I could go on for hours describing the Argentina's current state of affairs. 
Let's be clear. CFK's regime is an affront to Argentina's tax-payers and middle-class. Her plan is to pauperize the country and turn it into a cheap version of Venezuela or Cuba's communist regime. ",0,,False,c6ggmwh,False,False,1349188092.0,2012-10-02 09:28:12

Drew Pendergrass just had a nice column [in *Harvard* magazine](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2020/09/jhj-undergraduate-to-catch-crawdad) on this, where he proposes that pandemic isolation can be an opportunity to recalibrate your sense of rhythm and meaning by taking cues from the natural world instead of Harvard's turbo-speed academic grind.

Loneliness at Harvard,Jenbrooklyn79,"Harvard has a large endowment and a large pool of alumni who contribute donations after they graduate. This large amount of money allows the school (hopefully) to invest in better libraries, labs, professors, and student life.

Like others have said it’s important to not tie your value as a person to any school. Having a goal like attending a top tier school is a very commendable goal. If that’s YOUR goal. Don’t let your parents or society tell you what you should want out of life.

Where I differ from some opinions is that where I come from (work background) no one went to college let alone an IVY league school. So, I’ll bask in all the fucking Harvard glory and everything that comes with it because I worked hard for it and no one ever expected that I would succeed at college let along Harvard. 

Maybe a lot of students have felt they were “at the top” of a lot of things in life. But I’ve been at the bottom for a long time and it feels good to be able to say I did this. I don’t feel a sense of guilt or privilege that oppresses me. For me it is a cool school, that’s why I decided to go here, it means something to ME. 

The main point I’m trying to make is don’t do it just because it’s a cool school or because you think this is what people expect of you. And don’t tie your value to any school!",2,,False,g40vs1w,False,False,1599245506.0,2020-09-04 13:51:46

Find stuff you like to do, and see how that might become a career. It doesn’t have to be exactly what you always imagined either. I always wanted to be an actress but what I loved about being an actress was that everyday was different, I got to be creative, and I got to create a project from beginning to end.

On the other hand, many richer, better-connected, or domestic students already have unfair advantages in things which are competitive, like curved classes and recruiting.  Clearly we don’t currently require everyone to have the exact same opportunities. And education is clearly beneficial for people outside just career outcomes and GPAs 

Education doesn’t have to be “fair”, and it is never totally fair, but people naturally want a “fair” system for outcomes, and the use of supposedly-objective GPAs in job recruiting and grad school makes some “fairness” required.

Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids. Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work would lead to this particular result. But the limits of the drafters' imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.

Presumably $5k is somewhere around the ""true"" marginal dollars that Harvard saves by not having someone on campus.  (Since they've still got a lot of people and services they need to pay, even if students don't show up.)  I.e., not much...

Obviously, there is thorny transfer pricing involved...but I assume this is roughly the math they are doing.

* Any form of **retaliation** for reporting harassment is now a contract violation, which can be fought with the help of a union advocate

* Even though there's no third-party arbitration, there is going to be an **internal appeals panel**, theoretically more independent of the administration than Title IX is, to hear complaints about identity-based harassment.

Harvard and grad student union reach first ever contract,vegatwyss,"GSAS was (perhaps deliberately) unclear about this, but the announced increase was very much part of the bargaining process. Back in March, the administration had been offering 2.7%, while the union wanted much more (UConn's graduate student union got a 7% increase in their first contract, for example). Then the pandemic blew up, the administration called a brief hiatus in bargaining to get a better idea of their finances, they came back offering 2.8% even though everyone else was suddenly getting a pay freeze, the union bargaining committee tentatively agreed, and shortly afterwards the administration sent out the announcement (without making any reference to the ongoing negotiations).

The way I see it, the union won me a 2.8% raise in a pandemic where the default would have been a pay freeze, and now I'm giving half of that back to help the union build power to get me a better contract in a year, when the crisis has (I hope) mostly passed. The largest slice of money from dues will go to our local for things like hiring arbitrators to adjudicate contract violations (paid equally by the union and Harvard), paying union representatives to advocate for student workers who might want to file grievances and to continue to organize, etc.

And I'm sorry for being repetitive, but to be absolutely clear: you do not have to pay dues if you don't want to, regardless of how or whether you vote. You can sign an ""authorization card"" instead of a union membership card, which will give you the right to participate in the contract ratification vote without joining the union or being liable for any fees (although you wouldn't be able to elect union representatives, or have a say in how we set up our union's bylaws and administer the contract).",2,,False,fv8vs12,False,False,1592497893.0,2020-06-18 11:31:33

Did I make a mistake choosing Harvard?,softasagrape,"Hey I know I'm late to the game but I really vibed with this post. My heart goes out to you.

I went to Harvard (Lowell '19) because it was the cheapest option by a mile and cause, as you say, the clout. I didn't apply to any other ""top"" schools, so I didn't have to live with the regret of passing up any other great options for Harvard. Let me tell you though, I HATED Harvard. I always thought I was one of those optimistic people who could be happy anywhere, but I soon realized that being happy in Cambridge is not easy. I feel you and I want you to know this feeling isn't unusual. 

The best thing I got out of Harvard (apart from a handful of good friends) is a lot of mental strength. I rode Harvard and I came out alright. Once you graduate, every other living situation you will ever have that is not literally a Turkish prison will seem wonderful and supportive. I know a lot of people from other top colleges who crumbled under the weight of grad school and young-professional life due to the lack of support or community available to them in the world outside college, but not me. Hey, we survived the scorched hellscape that it blocking, house ""life,"" and finding a concentration advisor, so navigating a PhD program is a dream. 

I've also accumulated a good many alumni friends since graduating and I've heard that many schools (Yale, in particular) have similar social problems, but the campus culture is one that doesn't tolerate criticism. One of the cool things about Harvard is that you can sit in the middle of the dining hall with your crappy brain break bagel and scream ""I hate my damn life and the resident dean is an awful person and my concentration sucks and I wish I could just dissolve into nothingness!!!"" and at least one person around you is gonna go ""lol same."" You're not forced to ""duck paddle,"" you can openly struggle and, while your useless resident dean won't give a crap, another kid might. That's rarer and more valuable than you'd think. 

Also, free advice I learned the hard way: Honey, if the club makes you go through an extended comp, the club doesn't deserve you. Plenty of smaller clubs don't require comps. Find one that gels with your interests. Screw the Crimson, screw the Finals clubs, screw even the HoCo if they make you jump through hoops.  This isn't high school. Excluding people isn't cool anymore. It's immature af. 

3.7 GPA is amazing. Don't feel bad. 

 Most importantly: If it comes down to taking time off or hurting yourself, TAKE TIME OFF.

Did I make a mistake choosing Harvard?,theeyeguy84,"My two cents as a 2007 grad:  
I also couldn’t say no after EA acceptance and multiple times had significant doubts about my choice...I think most introspective and analytical people do.

I think the people that are drawn to Harvard are the type that expect the best of everything, all the time.  Not that Yalies are any different, but there definitely is a sense from my Yale friends that the “community” forged in their campus against NH almost forces them to bond in ways that Harvard’s more expansive community doesn’t.   That being said, the House community becomes a wonderful enclave and I can’t imagine things being much different in a Yale residential college.  Also, the club scene at Harvard dominates the social scene in ways similar to the societies at Yale, however they’re a much larger percentage of the population over there; I would imagine this impacts social anxieties for Yalies even more pervasively than at H.  

The quality of life is exceedingly high at Harvard, and in many ways, the best of any Ivy.  I do concede that the architecture at Yale does portend a sense of gravitas that the H brick can’t match, though.  

I now am a practicing physician and loving life.  My GPA was not even close to 3.7 and even graduating in the low 3’s I was accepted to a great state medical school and ultimately the residency of my choice.   I also did a lot of extracurriculars that impacted my grades, but the breadth of resources to explore at Harvard is really unparalleled.  I too was consumed with a comp, for me the Lampoon, that ultimately bore fruit Junior yr and believe that all the failed attempts made me a better artist- I just wanted it more.  It became the singular experience of college my senior year and made me realize another way Harvard is one of a kind.  The Lampoon is just magical.  

No matter what you ultimately choose to spend your energy towards, you’ve already achieved so much.  Just try to soak as much in as you can.  Walk or jog along the river, something your Eli friends can’t do.  Check out a Sox game, and literally pinch yourself every few weeks because your that much closer to a degree from the “best” university in the world.  But what really matters is that college is what you make it, and it’s a challenge no matter where you go.

The real concern is with the endowment. Dispersements from the endowment cover 1/3 of operating expenses. After 2008, the endowment lost 30% of its value. It slowly regained all of that and then some. The concern is that the endowment will lose value such that the annual dispersements will eat into the principle each year.

> After discovering the existence and contents of the chat, Harvard administrators revoked admissions offers to at least ten participants in mid-April, according to several members of the group.

With rights come responsibilities.   If you want to say offensive things, that is your right.  However, people are not required to LIKE you, let you join their private club, or be forced to agree with your offensive statements.

Sadly, today, people think ""free speech"" means being able to say whatever you want, without consequence, and not only do you get to say it, but if you are a public figure, the people advertising on your program have no right to withdraw their support (infringing your free speech!).

I'm not talking about students' rights, school or law-given -- Harvard clearly has the prerogative to choose who matriculates. I'm just not sure it's prudent, from a school policy standpoint, that [these memes](https://thetab.com/us/2017/06/05/harvard-memes-rescinded-69413), given that they were posted in a private group, meet a standard necessitating removal from the Harvard admitted student list. Eldo Kim is still at the school, for pete's sake! A ""one nasty joke/insult and you're gone"" policy, coupled with a consistently demonstrated administrative willingness to dig into students' private correspondence, seems like a recipe for a massively on-edge and unhappy student body. 

Further, such a policy seems ripe for agenda-based abuse -- given (among other things) the school's asymmetric enforcement of the 'SGSO' sanctions, would the school have been so quick to punish the posting of similarly shocking memes if they had been directed at characters less in line with the political leanings of the school's faculty and staff?

Harvard Rescinds Acceptances for At Least Ten Students for Obscene Memes,Dkennemo,"When it comes to free speech, there are a few things that a lot of people don't understand. One is that, as a Constitutional right, it only applies to censure by governmental entities; the importance of keeping speech free - even when it is OFFENSIVE speech - is that citizens should be able to express their thoughts without it being deemed ""subversive"" (giving a convenient excuse for those in power to repress dissent). And this is so they can be better, fully participating citizens.

The case of universities is interesting because a lot of the same values the Framers had in mind are valued by universities - freely sharing ideas, free association, etc. - but at the end of the day, this is circumscribed by the university's discretion to determine how best to compose the class, so that the resources offered will be put to their highest and best use. When people display the kinds of atrocious attitudes demonstrated by these kids on FB, it's just not the kind of ""free speech"" the university wants to foster and protect - it doesn't relate to finding higher truth, furthering the exchange of ideas, etc.

Their political views should not be a deciding factor for whether they are allowed into Harvard. Harvard might have the right to do this, but god damn does it show how fucking weak neoliberales are. Instead of allowing people into a institution based on merit and hard work, ultimately it's who they wanted to win the election that matters.

How did you deal with imposter syndrome?,thelonelycerebellum,"It's definitely a real feeling. I find it helpful to decide what I want, and then ignore what everyone else is doing (academic- and career-wise) as much as possible. I also remind myself that success is not a zero-sum game. Your classmates are not your rivals; they're your peers, and you can learn from them. That said, I think it's healthy (and interesting!) to surround myself with people who have interests and ambitions very different than my own. Like if you're pre-med, maybe don't always hang out with the other pre-meds, y'know? It helps a little with comparing yourself to others, which is always a losing battle.

Other times I'll catch myself feeling jealous of a friend getting some cushy  job or something like that, and then have to take a step back and think, ""I literally would rather cut off my right arm than do something like this.""

How did you deal with imposter syndrome?,xiipaoc,"There are very few supergeniuses at Harvard (at least there weren't when I was an undergrad, which was... not that recently?  Maybe things have changed).  There aren't even that many super-achievers.  It feels like there are, but in my experience, the super-achievers aren't actually all that smart; they just put in a LOT of effort.  Harvard admissions can generally see through that.  What super-achieving *has* happened is generally more a product of educational opportunities -- motivated parents with lots of free time, fucktons of money, a really excellent school system -- and not *really* personal excellence of some sort.  Again, there definitely *are* supergeniuses, just not as many as you think.  Most Harvard students are actually pretty normal, just generally smart, probably like you.  For every famous musician or actor or IMO gold medalist there's dozens of people who love learning and are really good at it but aren't superstars.  That's a really big ratio relative to almost anywhere else in the world, which is one of the reasons people want to come to Harvard in the first place, but those supergeniuses are still a very small minority.  When I first came to Harvard, I thought I was one of the least qualified students on campus, but I quickly realized that this just wasn't true at all.  I don't know what things are like now, but as a math guy, I was absolutely *not* going to take Math 55, holy fuck no, I'm not a supergenius!  But when I ended up with one of the two highest grades in Math 25 in my year, I realized that, well, I may not be a supergenius, but I'm still pretty good at this math thing, right?  (I guess probably could have taken 55.  I didn't particularly want to find out.)  I'm sure you have something *you're* pretty good at, or you wouldn't be at Harvard.  Most people at Harvard are probably not that good at the thing you're good at, because they're good at other things instead.  And that's OK!  The way I see it, if you can handle the courses, you're fine.

The other side of this is that you *can't* handle the courses, you really aren't fine, and you probably shouldn't be at Harvard.  Impostor syndrome is only a syndrome when it's not real.  Like, if you feel like you're an impostor *and you actually are*, you should, you know, reorient your expectations.",3,,False,g3lpy1y,False,False,1598975886.0,2020-09-01 10:58:06

Maybe if your academics or possibly extracurriculars aren’t providing that social space for you, consider changing it up. Go to IMs. Shake things up.

Dating life here absolutely sucks,whymauri,Boston is the largest and most diverse college town in the world. I think branching out to social scenes different from the ones you've been experiencing your 1st semester is a good idea. Whether that's different social groups within Harvard or other universities (disclaimer: am MIT student).,46,,False,edcajw2,False,False,1546733625.0,2019-01-05 18:13:45
Dating life here absolutely sucks,HarvardDating,"Dating in higher academia is virtually nonexistent. I’ve had a very active dating life for the last 4 years exclusively from top schools, and the majority of people are only looking to hook up. This is primarily driven by the academic load, but most people also want to go on to grad school, there are summer internships, etc. Nurturing a strong relationship in the climate that rigorous schools produce is incredibly difficult. Internships take you all around the country over the summer, your classes, work, and clubs take up all your time during the year, and breaks are generally spent with family. If you look hard you’ll find someone looking for the same thing, but the chance that they’re what you’re looking for in a partner is also low.

I’d recommend seeking out people, not relationships. If you’re just looking to date someone, you’re going to end up in a relationship that you entered because you wanted a relationship, not because you wanted the person. In the mean time, work on developing yourself. Work out, focus on your hobbies, etc. If everyone right now is too busy for dating then they won’t have time for these things, which will make you more desirable when dating becomes a possibility.

If I were you, I’d make a bumble. It’s a great way to meet people. Ultimately, you want to be looking for the right person, and it’s unlikely they’re just going to show up in your life. The last time I was single it was for 4 months, and I went on tinder/bumble dates with at least 75 people in that time due to my free time, and the fact that I wanted to find the right person. I’ve now found someone great that I wouldn’t have had I not **thrown** myself out there.

Good luck!",39,,False,edc464a,False,False,1546729554.0,2019-01-05 17:05:54
Dating life here absolutely sucks,ResTutorThrowaway,"I worry about this with my students as well, but I’m forming a theory that there is at least a moderate dating life. I’ve found it almost impossible to spot couples in the house proper, but I have noticed them off campus. A few of my folks have quietly introduced me to their significant others and until that introduction, I would have guessed “single”. It could be that my dating radar is tuned for a different environment, but I think people are having serious, romantic connections and for whatever reason, they’re remaining very quiet about them.  I’m not talking about hookups, mind you.  I think they’re also having breakups in silence, too, since the folks who have wanted to talk about their breakups ALSO never triggered my couples radar. 

I don’t know that this is helpful for you, but it is something I’ve noticed.  Of course, what I’ve found most helpful is to talk, whether it’s “hey, I like you; any interest” or a “can I take you out on a date?” It can be scary, it can feel humiliating, but this is a big campus, the houses are big houses, and as long as you’re not a complete jerk the worst that’s likely to happen is a “no” or a single bland date.  (I am legit a Pollyanna, but I’m also incredibly talented at dating- seriously, try it.) If my theory is right, though, maybe a quiet approach if you do ask brave questions.  


Also, pick someone you respect and look up to.  It’s aaaaaaaaammaaaaaaazing to date a person like that and it helps with those times you will be apart if your relationships break the school year barrier.

Dating life here absolutely sucks,pinkerton_jones,"Yes dating is weird at Harvard. Yes you should branch out now. Don't feel funny about getting serious with someone soon. I met my wife freshman year, we were told constantly to not take it seriously. To date around. Rely more on a social network of friends than eachother. That was about 15 years ago. Those people are entering their late 30s single and with few prospects. Finding someone at your age is important. Branch out and take it seriously. Don't measure your life by As achieved, measure it by the depth of your relationships. You're at Harvard. Graduate and you're going to be okay. Find someone who will take you seriously and who you can depend on, because it is just the two of you in the wilderness when it comes down to it. I'd suggest looking at intercollegiate events, volunteering, or getting away from Harvard people to date seriously. It is very hard to date other Harvard people and have long term positive outcomes.

Of course there are many types of people present on campus, all with varying backgrounds and life stories and what not, but I have to agree with you that from what I've seen the dating climate is pretty lame. Others will object, but all in all, just wait for that single person to come along one day who will truly open up their heart to you and genuinely love you. Those who are tough to please, those who are too involved with themselves, are not worth chasing. A real relationship is not meant to be chased, but to flow naturally and fall into place with beauty and grace. I say this not making any assumptions about your situation but from the mistakes I've made in the past, wasting my time worrying about relationships when what I needed to do all along was focus on loving and improving myself, so that I can be the best boyfriend I can be when the time comes that I finally meet that special someone.",1,,False,ek04f2b,False,False,1554267081.0,2019-04-02 23:51:21

Sitting at a table does NOT constitute socializing: it's work when it's a conference or event.

I can't count the number of times I've had to suck it up and smile while with colleagues I disliked. If anything, Pinker was kind and professional to resist the urge to shun someone in our cancel culture.

My character would drop by social ratings I can't imagine if everybody judged me for sitting at tables with less-than-perfect colleagues at conferences and meetings.

He was consulted as a linguist about language used in Epstein's defense. If Pinker's interpretation of the language changed based on his *opinion* of Epstein, that would have undermined Pinker's credibility as a scientist. That Pinker was honest despite his *negative feelings* towards Epstein (he found Epstein loathsome) shows his authenticity and integrity as a scientist. 

Think about it. We need experts testifying based on their areas of expertise -- not on their opinions of guilt. 

Pinker despised Epstein. 

If you are ever accused of something and the mob comes for you, you will want experts who stay in their lanes and not let their personal feelings sway an analysis on which your life could hang.

Larry Summers and Steven Pinker have been on Epstein's Lolita Express,CharleenAdams,"The kind of thinking you are modelling is responsible for some the most heinous acts in human history. You have decided that you can arbitrate who does and doesn't deserve hell.

What you've shared about a moral and professional duty to shun is antithetical to the very heart of civil society and humanistic virtues, be they religious or secular.

About associating with those have been found guilty, I have associated with prisoners at San Quentin State Prison. I would allow myself to be photographed with them at an academic event if those I have taught meditation to are ever free and at an academic conference, whether or not I like them.

Everyone deserves human decency and kindness, and no one deserves to be falsely accused. Above you wrote that Pinker helped ""pay"" for Epstein's defense. That is a false accusation. The decent thing to do would be to apologize. Otherwise, you undermine yourself as a scholar, if indeed you are a divinity school student, as your avatar implies. By your own logic, you deserve to be shunned. In academia scholarly integrity matters. You have undermined yours here.

As a divinity grad myself, I'm sad to see someone whose avatar connects them to Harvard Divinity School falsely accusing another scholar.

I really regret completing my bachelor's degree at the Extension School. I'm not sure if I should. (Apologies for the rant.),granta50,"I mean... my two cents, it is worth it if you go there and are willing to work really hard. The work is just no joke. If you can achieve high grades, you can go on to some pretty amazing places. The professors are so kind, and down to earth, and teach so well, it's a truly remarkable opportunity. The low cost is also such a huge benefit. They could legitimately charge $50,000 a year to attend if they wanted to, and people would pay it! but they're genuinely true to the spirit in which the school was founded. 

But at least for me, it's such a rollercoaster just trying to explain where I went to school. And like I said in the original post, it is absolutely bizarre to say to someone, ""I didn't go to Harvard College, I went to Harvard Extension,"" and then it's like (at least to me) if they aren't disappointed, I feel like a con artist. Like, no, you're giving me too much credit. It's like if I don't down myself to people, I feel like a complete fraud. So even if it meant going to a school where I wasn't challenged, I'd still do so just so it wasn't a big issue when I told people where I went to school. 

So for example, I did a traditional master's program at another school after I completed my ALB. When people ask where I went to do my master's degree, I just say the name of the school. Not, ""I went to such-and-such university, faculty of English literature, etc. etc."" My degree just says ""MA in English."" Not ""Master of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies."" Employers aren't confused at what subject I studied.

It's such a relief not to have all the extra stuff. With the Extension School, it's like someone asks me where I went and it's like I have to spend three paragraphs explaining how I got my degree. And I feel like I have to put myself down in order to do it. And if I don't put myself down, and they have some idea in their mind that I must have gone to Harvard as in Harvard College, I end up literally feeling like a con artist. 

And here's the other catch -- if someone misunderstands where you went to school, they'll tell other people, ""Hey, this guy went to Harvard!"" And then you have to explain to *those* people you didn't go to the college, etc. etc. 

So for example, I remember after I graduated I interviewed for an internship. The subject of my degree never came up, but once the person who interviewed me hired me, she walked around the office saying, ""He went to Harvard."" I'd listed my degree the right way on my resume and everything. And I was so ashamed to correct her in case she thought I was trying to fool her that I didn't speak up and say anything. I felt so awful that I ended up leaving the position.",7,,1571020411.0,f3ok914,True,False,1571020183.0,2019-10-13 21:29:43

Harvard records show discrimination against Asian-Americans: group | Reuters,mileylols,"If Harvard's defense is that Asian applicants rank lower on personality traits and this is the root cause of a lower than otherwise expected admissions rate, and the plaintiffs choose to meet them head on regarding this point, which it seems they want to do, then the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that Asian applicants as a group are objectively not weaker in this category. 

Based on an inexperienced reading of their filing (IANAL) it does not appear that they have done this. Rather instead, they have demonstrated that Asian applicants receive lower scores in this area, (using some definitely janky non-standard mathematics, but Harvard does not really dispute it) and then imply that because these ratings are subjective, they must be lower as a result of discrimination. They dismiss out of hand Harvard's witness's contention that Asian applicants are actually weaker in this category, calling it, ""offensive racial sterotyping... legally and factually untenable."" Stereotyping or not, they have to prove it to be false, and that's actually really really hard to do. 

Quotes from leadership who are not directly involved in admissions are not weighty, and it is not hard to think of explanations for why admissions-office ratings can differ from alumni-interviewer ratings. Instead, the plaintiffs try to push the burden of proof onto the defendant, asking Harvard's witness to present a non-race explanation for the lower personality trait scores. While his refusal to do so constitutes a weak defense, it is still plausibly coherent, and the plaintiffs must pierce it themselves. If they are unable to do so, then I'm not sure they have much of a case. 

***

Sideways from the legal stuff, it is clear that Harvard has a system that they implement that consistently produces the student body that they desire. The plaintiffs believe that the process should be different, resulting in a different student body composition. Who gets to make that kind of decision, and how much control should the government have over it? These are some really interesting questions that are going to get answered as all of this plays out.

Harvard records show discrimination against Asian-Americans: group | Reuters,asian_throaway,"So I'm one of those Asians with a  perfect sat score, high class rank + national level competitions/ extracurriculars in math and the social sciences, that likely got rejected due to  the caps 10 years ago. Also I didn't realize it until college but my family was dirt poor compared to my peers (waiter + post-doc salary).  


Ultimately all the Ivies rejected me but luckily I got into another school with similar but not quite as  good career outcomes (like 25&#37; of class goes to iBanking and Management  consulting vs like 40&#37; at Harvard or Princeton). In particular I remember my  UPenn alumni interview went really really well and I was devastated when  I was waitlisted. Also was bitter for a while because Cornell didn't take  me but took my best friend who was an A- student with 300 pts lower on the SAT than me but White.  
10 years later none of this matters much to my career but I can't help but think how different my future would've looked if I went to a non-target school instead. I likely would've ended up pursuing a career in Engineering or Medicine as opposed to Finance simply because the recruiting networks weren't there.   
If Edward Blum wins his case and proves there were racial quotas of around  20&#37; of class for asian americans at most super-selective colleges, will there be class action lawsuits that harmed students can sign up for?  
Also do yall think this would shift the dial on mba admissions at HBS? I would be very happy if the courts forced universities to publish similar data for their business school with race + gender that something reputable like Propublica or Brookings can dive into and analyze. Based on facebook posts (not a great representative sample which is why I want official data) I have like \~10 female asian finance/consulting friends who've gotten into HBS or Stanford GSB in recent years vs like \~0 asian males with similar careers (but the asian guys are still getting into other schools like Michigan or Booth).

And race is one of those groups, regardless of whether you're a public institution or private. It's why we don't have whites only stores anymore.

However, college admissions get fuzzier. This issue first came up in light of affirmative action, when a white student sued saying she wasn't admitted because of affirmative action for racial minorities. Courts ruled that a university (public in that case) could consider race in admissions to create a more diverse group of students, the argument being that this was beneficial for the members of the cohort.

But there a couple of significant differences. That was a state school, and the plaintiff was white. Here, those suing Harvard are minorities in the general population, though over-represented in the applicant pool relative to that.

Harvard records show discrimination against Asian-Americans: group | Reuters,mileylols,"Is the claim inherently racist? I don't think so. I think it *may* be, but is not necessarily so. 

The plaintiff filing argues that Asian applicants as a group get stronger academic scores than white/black/hispanic applicants. The implication is that this is fair because Asians are objectively stronger in this category. How come this statement is accepted as not racist against the academically weaker white/black/hispanic groups? Is it just because there is evidence for it, so we know it to be true? 

The main difference between the situation of the academic score and that of the personality score is that we are able to point at corroborating data for the academic score. There is no such point of reference for the personality score (potentially intentional on Harvard's part to make it easier to defend), so it could be true, or it could be bullshit. If it's bullshit, then it's racist. But if it's true, then it's just like the academic score, which the plaintiffs definitely don't think is racist, right? 

Edit: Now, do I personally think Asian applicants are objectively weaker in the personality category? No, outside of seeing reliable data that tells me differently, my default stance is that they are not. This is corroborated by the information the defense has provided from alumni interviewers and high school counselors. However, this is not a preponderance of evidence, and Harvard's assertion that there may be intangibles hidden in things like personal statement essays (which we maybe conveniently don't have access to) is at least plausible, even though it's far from definitive. Ironically, the closest thing we have to actual data in this regard are the disputed personality scores. 

I do not think either side is doing a very good job. However, since the legal burden of persuasion lies with the plaintiffs who are bringing the claim that Harvard is discriminatory (different from evidential burden, which shifts from party to party based on claims brought), they need to do a better job in order to win.

Harvard Math,gdavtor,"Math 55 is a very good class if you want to do nothing but math on your spare time. It's not too bad if you've been exposed to higher math before (group theory, rings, modules, manifolds, ...). However, if those are foreign words to you, it will be a very hard class. 

Of course the topics covered in Math 55 are eventually covered later in other courses. In fact, math 55 mostly covers sophomore level math. So it's not particularly advanced; it just moves fast as is a good challenge. 

It is not common for undergrads to stay there for the PhD. The reason is that they want you to explore other places and do math somewhere else.

The material is supposed to be roughly the same (except much more) as in the other freshman math classes -- multivariable calculus and linear algebra -- except that the material is approached in a much deeper way and the problems are much more challenging and interesting.  You should take Math 55 if you're God's gift to mathkind, because Math 55 is designed to still greatly challenge you at that level, where all other math classes covering the same material will be less challenging and thus less interesting.  Math 55 is why those people go to Harvard, because they want to have the experience of this class.  But if you're only a mortal, it might just be *too* hard to be as rewarding as it is for them.

Your PhD advisor usually weighs much heavier than where you got your PhD, because when people are looking to hire you for your expertise, they don't care about the name; they care about the research you did and if it was with someone well-known.

I bought two pairs of noise-cancelling headphones...,OmnemVeritatem,"You haven't asked for recommendations on noise-canceling headphones, but I thought this might help you out.

Here are my 3 go-to's, in the order of my preference, along with my wife's favorite. Each of these has blue-tooth connectivity for both Apple and Android and also have the ability to connect to multiple blue-tooth devices. Overall, I recommend Sony products over BOSE or Jabra. Here are my personal rankings.

1- Sony WF-1000XM3 (Rose colored). These are in-ear headphones that do an awesome job at noise canceling. They are my primary noise-canceling earbuds/headphones because they perform almost as well as the BOSE below, but are much smaller and their charge lasts forever. You'll need to ensure you get a good fit with the ears though, and some folks won't like the feel of them. I've worn them for about 100 hours, and have never been left with dead batteries. Like most of the Sony products, they have transient, noise-canceling, and also normal modes. The problem is, the transient effect will switch to full-on noise-canceling causing a few seconds delay where you can't hear anything. If you are in an environment where you may need to hear someone randomly talking to you, this is a problem. However, if you use them in transient-mode while on the phone the folks listening to you won't notice. These are also the only USB-C rechargeable headphones on the list, which means they take less time to recharge and is probably why I've never had them go dead.

2 - BOSE Quiet Comfort 35 II Wireless Bluetooth - These are over-the-ear headphones and dominated the noise-canceling arena for years. Because they are over the ear, they do a great job of canceling more noise than the in-ear types. The reason I don't like them as much as the sony WH-1000XM3's is I tend to sweat in my ears when wearing the BOSE.

3 - Jabra Elite Active 65t Earbuds - Normally, I would rate these well, but frankly, the fall out of my ears all the time. Also, the software to control them is crap. That said, they are my only waterproof pair, so you can't fault that. Also, for phone calls, I've found they fade in and out, and I usually need to switch to wired. So, fall out of the ear on airplanes and don't do well on calls... so next-to-last place.

Wife's Favorite: Sony WI-1000X My wife works in a noisy office environment that needs good noise-canceling. However, she also hates the ear-bud thing because she's concerned about losing them. I got her these and they are her daily driver.  She has the same transient-noise-canceling switch issue noted for the earbuds in #1 above.

TLDR: Sony makes great products, and I recommend either the WF-1000XM3 (if you want earbuds) or the Sony WI-1000X (if you want something more secure). I recommend BOSE quiet comfort if you want over-the-ear headphones. If you exercise and want an earbud with noise-canceling that is waterproof, the Jabra Elite is a great choice as long as you make sure you get a good fit in your ear.

Harvard Crimson,wmsutton,"I consider myself a strong supporter of journalism, I wrote for my school paper in high school in which I covered issues like trans rights in my town and a local fight to halt a federal energy project. I respect journalism and believe it is a tool for good. That being said...

Journalists do have a moral obligation to protect people they report upon when those people are clearly vulnerable in the situation. War journalists do this often, as do political journalists who use deep background and other methods to protect sources. It’s not very difficult, when a journalist approaches a conflict between two sides, to evaluate the power imbalance between the sides and adjust tactics accordingly. 

Given ICE’s (and related agencies) history of silencing dissidents and targeting of university students (see: MIT this week), the Crimson should have understood that blindly reaching out to ICE compromises the safety of students. The Crimson should OF COURSE strive to voice an alternative opinion, but they should have done so via more ethical journalistic methods. The most simple means of doing this is developing a source within the agency for comment on how it’s reacting without simply reaching out to the agency as a whole. This is pretty standard practice when working on sensitive topics. Journalists, professional or student, cannot pretend they have no obligation to protect those they report upon. Especially when one party in a conflict has a history of retributive terror, it betrays basic journalistic ethics to highlight to that party the vulnerable people who oppose it.

Bottom line, I do actually believe Crimson was in the wrong here. You can argue the student response is overly hostile, but that is a separate argument. The Crimson shirked journalistic responsibility, and instead of apologizing for this mistake (which, imo, would have hopefully set things right) decided to double down on the poor practice of their reporter. 

That being said, I wish OP no ill will. I’m glad you’ve found a community on campus and I, too, would like to see relationships between the Crimson and the activist wing of campus restored. But to do that, the Crimson has to admit it did something wrong.",5,,False,fecnm92,False,False,1578978445.0,2020-01-13 23:07:25

I don't feel okay,britinboston,"Harvard can be strange and intense at times. As others have pointed out, a lot of us have felt this way at some point or another so you're not alone, but you also won't feel like this forever. 
For me, freshman year was particularly strange for a lot of the reasons you describe - but by mid sophomore year, I had a different friendship group and different extracurriculars and a whole different take on it all. It's not going to happen overnight, but one of the great things about Harvard is that every new term can be a completely fresh start in terms of classes and extracurriculars and social life.
While you still in the midst of creating conditions for change, one thing that really helped for me was simply making time to get off campus as often as possible. Go for long walks or take the T and explore some of the nearby neighbourhoods. Make time for those things you know you enjoy, whether that's movies or sports or whatever. I promise you, you don't always need to be putting every moment in the day to 'good use' (part of the learning curve of Harvard is learning what is really necessary). I'd also really recommend choosing a low-time-commitment extra-curricular unrelated to your academic interests. I got a lot out of once a week after school tutoring with PBHA - the chance to get out of the Harvard bubble and interact with ordinary people living ordinary lives. I also went on one-off trips with the Outing Club or trips targeted at freshmen or particular house residents (e.g. trips to Salem, hiking, apple picking, etc) - it can be a good, low-pressure opportunity to meet some new people who are also willing to dedicate some time to self-care and fun (and may also be going through some of the same struggles)",3,,False,dp1rp49,False,False,1509287097.0,2017-10-29 09:24:57

Dear Harvard: You Win,electronicoffee,"Allow me to speculate: I think they were dating casually, no commitment, but she was really obsessed with him. After hooking up 3-4x or more, she shows up drunk expecting to get her pussy eaten and then to roll over and fall asleep. He had been drinking too and he took off her shirt and playfully nibbled her neck a little too hard since he was drunk and she smacked him playfully or something like most women would do at that point. He then sucked her tits and ate her out, he might have 'nibbled' a bit too hard once or twice and she got annoyed so after she got off, she turned to face the wall, as if she was going to sleep. Obviously any horny dude would be pissed or at least incredibly disappointed / offended. She was in his dorm and after getting off she's just gonna leave him 'hanging' fuck that- so he voiced up after being essentially used for sex by her, and wanted a blowjob. She said no. He was obviously annoyed by this and asked her to finish him off and not leave him with blueballs, so she sighed, rolled her eyes and jerked him off. The next morning this dude knew she was a psycho and a selfish lover and he dumped her and probably told all his friends about what a selfish bitch she was. Little miss thing was still obsessed over him, so much she missed classes and blamed it on her heartbreak, but a scored heart soon turns hateful and she felt a rush of anger each time she saw him in the laundrymat or library so she decided she wanted him out of her House so that she wouldn't have to look at him and feel hurt / rejected. She got more and more obsessed as no one believed her bullshit story (for good reason) and fell into a downwars spiral of skipping classes and attempting to grasp at straws to get the guy punished.

Dear Harvard: You Win,himself809,"She wrote this: 
>Shortly after I reported my sexual assault to my House staff, I was told by a senior member of the College administration that the Administrative Board was very unlikely to “issue a charge” against my assailant and to launch a thorough investigative process because my assailant may not have technically violated the school’s policy in the student handbook.

Then this, which I feel like is what you're talking about when you say they offered to investigate:
>The school was extremely reluctant to take any action against my assailant without a fair investigative process. In theory, this approach makes perfect sense. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and you cannot take severe action against a student—such as forcing him to move to a different House—without a formal investigation process. But in practice, this works against sexual assault survivors at Harvard.

Taking these two together, as I read her she's saying the figures responsible for addressing allegations of sexual assault on campus preferred to hew to the school's narrow definition of sexual assault rather than actually try to help her in any significant way. Yes, she does say this makes sense, since it's not like random administrators can change school policy by themselves. But she *also* seems to be arguing that that definition reflects a broader unwillingness by the university not only to address allegations of sexual assault, but also to offer basic support to a victim of sexual assault.

So that's the context of her saying (to everyone's horror!) that in practice ""innocent until proven guilty"" works against survivors of sexual assault at Harvard. Basically, ""innocent until proven guilty"" for the school doesn't mean ""avoid light accusations and rely on thorough investigations so everyone's treated as fairly as possible."" Instead, for people in her situation it means ""the school refuses at every turn not only to make rudimentary efforts at investigation, but also to offer basic support. We prefer to force this person to resign herself to unsympathetic mental health counselors and sexual assault response staff, and stonewall her requests until eventually her only recourse is to transfer to another house to avoid seeing daily the person who assaulted her.""

There's a lot the school could've done without even coming close to violating the presumed innocence of the person who assaulted her, but as she tells it they did none of those things.",9,,False,cghbe0z,False,False,1396361377.0,2014-04-01 09:09:37

Likely Bioengineering or biochem. Costs are not an issue. On mobile so sorry for formatting.

Hello everyone, hope you’re all safe and well. I was accepted to UMich early after most of my high school life being so UMich oriented and I was so damn grateful. I aimed at getting accepted at an Ivy but never really considered the possibility. Thankfully I got accepted into Harvard too, and I never thought I’d actually be in a position where I need to make a decision. It seems like Harvard is the way to go and everyone expects me to commit, and I’d love to of course, but as the deadline approaches I’m dreading detaching from UMich.

That said:

UMICH (LSA) ——— Pros: -quite close to home

-In state tuition and I’m covered very well with financial aid, plus amazing scholarships

-I’m quite familiar with the city and campus of Ann Arbor, and I love it so much.

-Amazing programs and research facilities for STEM. The Undergrad Research Opportunity Program I know a lot about

-Party and social life seems very compelling (I’m an extremely social person)

-I have many good friends attending there to help introduce me to and guide me through programs/courses

-I can choose to live in an apartment w friends, cook my own meals, cheaper than dorms and I get financial aid as a check

-I’m already used to Michigan weather lmao.

Cons: -missing out on a completely different lifestyle at Harvard

-still just as difficult a courseload and expectations as Harvard

•	⁠would have to try to transfer to engineering department to major in biomedical engineering. This would be an issue cause the engineering department is much more difficult to get accepted to. So taking a big risk if I go down that route

-everyone freaking out I didn’t accept Harvard

-don’t know about meal plan and food quality if I dorm there

HARVARD —————

Pros: -literally Harvard

-grade inflation

-many internship opportunities in the cities.

-bioengineering degree ( B.S. ) courseload is basically set, easy to select as major

-I have multiple good friends accepted from class of 2018/19 and know a couple alumni who can help me out along the way.

-very new lifestyle completely independent of family and I’m excited to adapt

•	⁠very VERY good financial aid, plus return on some scholarships. I’d start freshman year off well

-Cambridge/Boston have lots to explore, entire northeast section of America is more accessible to me

-long time friends are at MIT so we could meet up!

-forgot the rest but feel free to add more pros and encourage me

Cons:

•	⁠taking a bioengineering (B.S.) major means little flexibility in schedule to take interesting/ fun courses. A B.A. means I need to take more steps post undergrad to get my degree accredited for a career.

-I know I’m going to college to study not party but I sacrificed so much social life these last years and with corona stripping my only semester with freedom away, I so desperately want a better party atmosphere. This may be biased off their experiences but according to my friends there and others online, those rare moments when you’re not blasted w Harvard courseload the parties aren’t nearly all that.

-the fooood. I’ve heard it’s not the best and cooking for myself isn’t the best option either. I have some religious dietary restrictions so I kinda need to consider that. in terms of city restaurants, I don’t know how many good options there are that suit the restrictions, I’d bet there aren’t many.

•	⁠I’ve visited campus last summer and it didn’t strike me as much as Ann Arbor’s does. I’ve only ever self toured the Harvard campus though.

-I cannot process urban city life. It just seemed like the weather and air itself was less enjoyable. Things were more rushed and cramped. Usually cloudier. I’m very comfortable w the more suburban close knit feel at UMich. Although I’ll be spending most time on campus so I think I won’t feel this as much.

That’s all I can think of for now I hope I don’t come off as ungrateful or pretentious or anything. I just so desperately want to make the most out of every college experience (barring the shutdown doesn’t extend till fall semester). I’d appreciate as much input as I can on both and a decision.

"""I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ... "" THREAD",sim_sayer,"Hi, also a British student, who chose to attend Harvard. My background is computer science, but I did some research in Bioinformatics. I have friends at Cambridge, and I did spend some time there as part of their residential program. So, pretty relevant experience in answering your questions!

It comes down to how you work, and what you want from a university experience. Cambridge is academic to the nth degree. This is for a number of factors, but lack of holistic evaluation, and the short terms mean that when you are at university you are working your ass off. There is a social scene if you really look for it, but students at Cambridge are either happy doing lectures 6 days a week and homework on sundays, or can pressure themselves into doing it.

Now, I'm probably biased. I love Harvard. But with a 4 year course, you have a certain amount of flexibility that is just plain cool. Like I said, I am a computer scientist, and in the UK I would have been locked into it. This year, I have done Chinese, ancient Greek warfare, genetics and bio ethic etc. etc. along side my usual computer science studies. You spend a significant amount more time actually at university as well, so there is less of this cram culture, and you get to make more meaningful connections and enjoy your time there a little bit. Boston in beautiful, and a real city very much unlike Cambridge. You get to really live independently, as there is no way to hop home all the time (or have parents visit every other weekend). The academic flexibility is unparalleled, you get to really explore your subject and any other academic interests you have.

There are a few cons, but you can spin all of them:

Roomates- honestly not that bad, and it means that you have instant friends.

Work / interning - really easy to do, with your student visa you get 12 months work time over here, so you can intern in LA if you want over the summer. You also finish a little earlier in the summer, so if you want to come back to the UK you have a slight edge.

Drinking age- I wouldn't worry about the 21 thing ;)

Football - yes, they call it soccer. but also yes american football is surprisingly entertaining. Harvard Yale is really something else.

Happy to answer any other questions about UK specific things, but if I were you I'd go Harvard. People on the Cambridge subreddit will probably have their own views, but I think in terms of maximizing this once in a life time university experience, Harvard is the way to do it.",18,,False,fm9k48q,False,False,1585870370.0,2020-04-02 18:32:50

"""I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ... "" THREAD",oajm,"I just submitted my thesis as a mechanical engineer at Harvard, which means I have satisfied all of my ABET requirements. You can certainly do it in four years. Some people even work in a minor as well, usually in computer science or applied math or the like. However, it is not easy. Everyone else in the college has about half of the amount of required courses that you have. This means that you have much less flexibility and have to be   a bit careful with course selection in sophomore year and beyond. You always have the option of switching to the non-accredited degree, which has fewer requirements. I personally tried to front load my courses and ended up having a relatively light course load in my senior year, which gave me time to work on my thesis.

My view on classes. In general, engineering is hard and I think that’s just as true at Dartmouth and Harvard and anywhere else. Because of our small class size we have excellent access to professors and administration. Also, you will have a brand new campus at Harvard which will offer many great resources (undergraduate labs, students spaces, slick lecture halls...).

"""I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ... "" THREAD",mustardAndFish,"This is incredibly helpful! Thank you so much for your detailed account. I have a few follow up questions.

On the Cambridge sub reddit they were emphasising the depth of learning around a subject. If I were to complete my concentration in bioengineering at Harvard do you think my depth of knowledge would be less than if I had done so at Cambridge? I know this will in part be affected by classes that I choose to take but intend to take classes that are academically rigorous. 

And if I were to come out of Harvard with 'less knowledge' than at Cambridge do you think this would make me less employable? The last thing I would want is for biotech firms to favour British educated students due to a more thorough scientific background.

But I do really like the flexibility in classes and am very excited to take up a new language, continue with writing and enrichment classes.

Also in terms of work/interning would employers need to fill out additional paperwork to give me an internship place as an international ? Would this make it less likely for me to get any places? Have you observed an American citizen bias? Though if this is not a problem Boston being a biotech hub should be great!

I think I am leaning towards Harvard at the moment. In terms of accomodation I've seen some YouTube videos where the bathrooms look quite appalling. How common is this? I think my parents are quite concerned about roommates but I think it should be okay.

I don't drink so the alcohol thing isn't a big issue:)

Also in terms of Boston weather, are the winters much colder than the UK? Do you think I'll need to buy winter boots? Or should normal UK winter wear be okay?

Also did you buy a laptop in the UK before coming to Harvard or whilst in the US? This is probably a stupid question.

Thank you so much for providing such a comprehensive pros and cons list. I may message you again a few weeks down the line if I have any more questions :)

TLDR Do you think Cambridge graduates come out as better scientists than their Harvard counterparts?

If Cambridge grads to have more depth of knowledge are they more employable than Harvard graduates?",2,,1585871763.0,fm9ltjp,False,False,1585871392.0,2020-04-02 18:49:52

"""I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ... "" THREAD",sim_sayer,"No, I don't buy the less knowledgeable thing. Cambridge students get their masters in bioengineering, and Harvard students get their masters at Cambridge. If there was a discrepancy here, it would not be possible. You do cover the same content, and if anything the incerased industry exposure you get through the US system makes you more employable. If pure academic bio tech was your thing, there might be a greater argument for Cambridge, but I still don't think it cuts close enough to make a significant difference.

The university handles most of the paper work. You have to do an extra tax form or two, but there isn't any bias that I am aware of.

Living conditions as a student are not as nice as what Cambridge offers, this is true. The first year halls are particularly old, and so some of the bathroom arrangements are less than optimal. I guess it depends on your standards, but the bathrooms are cleaned by dorm crew, and the set ups in years 2 3 and 4 are significantly better.

I really liked my roommates, as do the majority of people. Sometimes they are your ""friends for life"" and sometimes they are just people you see in the evenings, but you have your main friend group elsewhere. Remember, you are sharing with other Harvard students, so a pretty good demographic to get randomly placed with!

No worries on not drinking, there a plenty who don't. In fact, because of the law etc. there really isn't any pressure to do so.

Boston gets colder. It is more similar to the very heaviest days of our winter for a month or two straight. Winter boots would be a good idea, but the Harvard snow team work through the night with a fleet of snow plows making sure all the paths are clear. Unlike the UK, they are actually prepared for more than 2 inches.

I bought a laptop before. If you full financial aid, they will give you $2500 dollars or something toward a laptop once you arrive, so that's quite cool. I have a surface, which is great because I can write on it with the pen thing.

"""I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ... "" THREAD",crharvard,"I can chime in on this. I'm a senior physics concentrator, but for a little while I was in EE and took a lot of classes in it. Although this isn't Bioengineering, I'm familiar with the bioengineering requirements and have some friends doing it (and BME as well). 

I would say that the engineering courses I've taken have on average been rated more poorly than courses from other departments, and to be frank, I didn't enjoy those courses very much either, although I like engineering and will be studying it in grad school. But I will say that the one area where I think Harvard shines in engineering is absolutely bioengineering! Harvard has fantastic bioengineering resources, and there are amazing research labs here. Look up the Wyss Institute, especially! Most of the bad comments about engineering you see here and will hear at Harvard are mostly about the MechE and EE programs, not so much bioengineering, but you will share courses so there are some shared concerns.

When people say the degree structure is weird, I think it's because of the whole AB vs SB thing. Take a look at the following: [https://www.seas.harvard.edu/bioengineering/undergraduate-program/concentration-information](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/bioengineering/undergraduate-program/concentration-information). It explains the 3 different kinds of bioeng type degrees you can get, two of which are AB and one of which is SB. The SB degree is definitely what you want if you want to be an engineer and/or go to grad school to continue studying bioengineering. You will typically have a much more demanding schedule than others, at least in terms of sheer requirements. 

I don't think you should underestimate the immense value in the biotech community at Harvard and in the Greater Boston area.

"""I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ...

You also meet a lot of peers through introductory courses in the first year. The shuttle is nice, but it is a huge time sink and, for a general science class, wouldn’t be worth it unless you’d be willing to lose a whole day for a class. 

I have had friends who did bioengineering and they all agreed, it’s hell because of how demanding the course requirements are (I believe the advisor was new as well, and that didn’t help). They all went for the AB degree and not the SB degree, but I don’t think it made much of a difference in the end for the career paths they chose. 

A very very important note that someone has already commented is that Boston is a biotech hub, so you’ll find an amazing amount of opportunities there. Also, labs in the area are very receptive to taking undergrads (even from freshman year), even famous/high profile labs if you don’t specialize in what they do.

Harvard Accepts 4.59% for Class of 2022,JanetYellensFuckboy,"Factoring in how many of those accepted students were legacy: Jesus, that's fucking low.

I remember how getting accepted to college was my entire world in high school. After checking out r/applyingtocollege (out of morbid curiosity, I suppose) I see a lot of cynicism, despair, and depression, and my heart goes out to these kids.

Rejection letters are dreadfully well-crafted prices of trite clichés, but when they say stuff akin to ""You'd be a great student here and you'll be successful elsewhere,"" when a cutoff is that arbitrarily low, it's true. There is absolutely no intellectual difference between some accepted and a lot of rejected applicants, and this truth gets diminished by the thoroughly toxic culture of elitist rhetoric surrounding admissions, the vast majority of which comes from outside. And this toxic culture carries over into the accepted class with almost this strange variation of survivor's guilt I've noticed. 

I think if one would be successful at Harvard, one doesn't need Harvard to achieve whatever one would wish to achieve. Those kids just gotta not let the heartbreak get to their psyche, or channel it to propel themselves forward.

I just feel for those kids who feel so down now. Just wish they could know that Harvard College has a lot, but doesn't have it all; though this place is wonderful, other colleges offer wonderful things which this university does not. Such as warm weather. 

To those accepted: Congratulations & welcome to the best university on earth! To those not: I feel like it's impossible to say something about how great other other undergraduate experiences are too without sounding patronizing. Take CS50 through EdX this summer for a bit of the experience.

But I didn't go to Harvard College, that's my disclaimer, I'm merely immersed just enough to have a better sense of what the College is like than most.

Harvard undergrads: What do you expect from your Teaching Fellow(s)?,rough-hewn,"Former TF here. My best suggestions, looking back:

* Teach how to triage problems or assignment tasks, i.e. strategies to figure out how to approach a problem. For example, if it's a physics course, how do I figure out which equations are relevant for this problem?
* Give detailed, useful feedback when grading and/or provide a problem set answer key that clearly walks through the process to solving each problem.
* Make your office hours accessible. If it's at a time (or place were it not for remote learning) that's really inconvenient for students, nobody will show. Easier for you if nobody ever comes but not as helpful. If you see someone's struggling, specifically invite them to your office hours to walk through a few problems together.
* If appropriate to the course and you can manage it, think of ways to convey complex concepts that will be relatable to students' real-world intuition. I TFed a thermodynamics course, had some examples about weather that helped people mentally apply the concepts to think about daily life.
* Be aware that if your professor is particularly unskilled instructor (there are a few out there), students will get a lot of their practical learning through you. In such cases suggest taking a very practical approach, looking through a few past tests and figuring out what they would need to do well on them.",27,,False,g57bkpk,False,False,1600059415.0,2020-09-13 23:56:55

In CS classes what is important is that students get the intuition behind what is going on, some are just lost.  You have to identify their weakness or what they are lacking and guide them to resources so they can improve.  You want to give nudges in the right direction.  

I would be very active on the forums, and compile your office hours/section around what common things people are having trouble with.  If there is a problem specific to a student, I would save that for one on one and not section.

I feel like I'm not smart enough to be at Harvard.,Shotdownace,"I am an undergraduate Extension student and would not change a single thing about how I have chosen to experience college. 

If you're not admitted to a degree program, then you really shouldn't expect the same as admitted students. However, if you are, I know what you feel. I worked overnights for two years, got off at 5 am, then slept in the supply closet and showered in the sink at work each day before class at my local community college to save up enough to pay for classes and move to Cambridge. When I was off work, I was either at school or studying. Finally, I graduated with a 4.0 and drove across the country with everything I owned to begin studying at the Extension School. I did not so much deal with feeling like I didn't belong, or didn't deserve to be here. Instead, I felt like there were people out there who would discriminate against me and ostracize me for taking an alternative approach in the pursuit of education though it was the best one suited for my circumstances. That being said, every undergraduate Extension student I have met so far has been an intelligent individual with a unique circumstance or has fought a nearly overwhelming battle to get here. 

After I was admitted, I got angry that the narrative making you feel the way you do exists. I channeled that anger into getting involved at the University and researching all I could about our school including its history and relationship to the wider University - financial and otherwise. Continuing ed and executive ed brings in more tuition revenue than any other school, and each year around the same number of people graduate from the Extension School as the College (mostly ALM, ~150 undergraduates). We run a surplus so send cash back to the FAS. Our School is older than the Graduate School of Design, Graduate School of Education and the School of Public Health. Yet, a small sect of people have created that narrative but it is dying out. It mostly consists of old articles online. I know what you feel because I've experienced similar feelings, but real life involvement showed me the truth. 

Getting involved on campus helped me realize that narrative doesn't really exist off of the internet. When it does show up, there is nearly universal condemnation from those across the University. 

A bit of anecdotal evidence:
Since I was admitted I've served on the Board of a College club, an Extension club, a progressive fraternity and had some of the best nights of my life in the Quad. I would not change a single thing about how I have chosen to experience college. That's not even to mention the internships opportunities I have had as a direct result of my education at our school. You can make the experience of being an Undergraduate at the Extension School whatever you'd like it to be, but it takes an effort to get involved. We have a uniquely large amount of freedom and can use it for both our benefit and the benefit of the University. 

Since the undergraduates at the Extension School are so few we have a huge proportion of power when it comes to procedures, perceptions, and outcomes. For example, at a state school, there may be 15,000 undergraduates. Your voice may get lost amongst the others. Here, we could fill up a decently-sized conference room with the student body. In turn, we each have a greater share of the responsibility in representing our School and University. 

In summary, I believe the rights, privileges, and prestige are all there when studying at the Extension School since I have experienced them myself. Yet, keep in mind, above all we are here for the best education in the world at the best university in the world. 

Protips:

1. Email clubs around the University you are interested in and ask to join. The majority are totally cool with us joining.

2. Get involved with Extension clubs, networking events, dinners etc. 

3. Apply for Special Student Status which allows you to cross-register at all the schools within the University. 

4. Attend University-wide events on campus. (IOP talks are top-choices personally) 

5. Dream big and shoot for the stars.

HES - Success Stories,IAmBartacus,"I might be posting a bit too late for visibility, but I'll chip in that HUES has been life-changing for me.

I got a great music education through high school (studied privately with two of the most well-known names in jazz education, kind of by accident) and walked into a professional performing career at 18. I spent almost three decades playing music— touring the world, living overseas for long stretches at a time, doing a fair amount of teaching. For the last decade I've been working mostly in theater, to the point where I'm currently the Artistic Director of an emerging developmental theater company. But I've always felt that the lack of a formal degree was limiting.

A bit over two years ago I decided to start at HUES. I thought the EXPO-25 course was the biggest mistake I'd ever made—my professor was great, but I wasn't prepared for how intense the requirements were. The feedback was sharp and spot-on, definitely not for the thin-skinned. And the attrition was completely unexpected—we lost six people after the first class meeting as their writing was deemed lacking, and one more of my classmates withdrew in the third week. But I did well, finished all of the entry requirements, and gained admission.

Since then, as I said above, it's been life-changing. The advising staff is fantastic; responsive to questions, proactive with suggestions, and generally very supportive. The academic quality is first-rate all the way. I've taken a number of Harvard College classes in the unique way that HUES offers them, as live/recorded lectures with an HUES TF assigned; one of those classes set up discussion sections that included both college and HUES students. One course I took last semester was cross-registered at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, HKS, and HUES.

But, to the question: the academic opportunity is what pursuing the ALB degree has changed for me. I'm transitioning out of the performing arts world into a parallel career with public policy, social science, and arts elements. I'm looking at graduate research in those areas at a few places; the admissions departments I've corresponded with are impressed that the HUES degree is both a Harvard degree AND that it's earned while working full-time—one professor told me that the fact of juggling both was more impressive in itself than any single thing she's seen on a grad school application. So, that's my experience.

To echo what a few other posts have pointed out, it's rare-to-nonexistent in my own experience to encounter someone treating the degree as some kind of second-rate education. It's been the opposite—folks tend to accept that Harvard isn't going to put its name on something lightly. One of my biggest supporters as I've been juggling my schedule over the last few years is a Harvard College grad who works in my company, actually. She's always asking about classes I'm taking and has been vicariously excited for me on every campus trip I've had.

Snakes are people who are almost fully invested into their pre-professional life, to the point where they will stop a conversation if anyone mentions any of their triggers within a 20 ft radius. Common triggers include: Facebook, Goldman, JP Morgan Chase, Bain, BCG, Google, Amazon, McKinsey, Apple, Morgan Stanley, etc.

But what defines a snake from just a regular, post-graduation-minded student?

Insecurity.

Snakes are usually outwardly charismatic and seem to have no personality trait other than bro-ey. They smile a little too widely at not-funny jokes, push you aside to talk to someone they perceive to be more aligned with their interests or deem more ""important"" to know, and love to talk about opportunities they've had but never like to talk about what's upcoming for their future (since they're insecure you might apply to same thing and take it away from them). 

They seem fake and secretive always. Snakes rank their friends. Even if you're ""good friends"" with them, they don't seem to fully engage with you and are always keeping something from you. They go out on weekends not to expand their social networks, but to expand their professional networks since they're too insecure to make friends first and trust that their friends will help them in times of need. When you ask a snake to hang out, they most likely have recruiting events/interviews/coffee chats already scheduled but they won't tell you that since they're so insecure.

They'll readily let you fail instead of propping you up. They'll withhold opportunities instead of distributing them to others. They'll sometimes sabotage you to make you look bad. They'll shirk on mutual responsibilities in favor of working on their own applications and activities.",9,,False,ee3tx4g,False,False,1547536324.0,2019-01-15 01:12:04

Harvard has traditionally had a white alumni base. Harvard, regardless of what it says publicly, admits legacies more frequently than legacies. So it’s likely that whites are admitted more than minorities due to legacy status, all else equal.

Harvard has a ton of athletes. I was an athlete myself, and while there are sports Asians are well-represented in, I don’t think many would disagree with me that other minorities and whites are more represented in intercollegiate sports than Asians, but I will stress that *this is only from casual observation and I could be overstating how much this is true.* But, if it is true, whites and non-Asian minorities are admitted more frequently than Asians due to sports, all else equal.

Harvard does admit students from tough backgrounds. Overwhelmingly these are non-white and non-Asian students. So again, non-Asian minorities are admitted more frequently than Asians due to circumstance-affected admissions, all else equal.

So it seems to me that Asian students are caught in between traditional factors that favor whites and progressive factors that could benefit Asians but more likely benefit non-Asian minorities more, leading, in my view, to fewer Asian admits than there “should” be.",17,,False,e7lsea8,False,False,1539300223.0,2018-10-11 18:23:43

"Anti-Asian Bias, Not Affirmative Action, Is on Trial in the Harvard Case",ultrastarman303,"I think this would be completely true based on data from 50 years ago. Going off the slowly rising diversity of the incoming classes, with 2022 having an unprecedented majority non white student body, we see the alumni pool becoming more and more diverse as well. Given this, I wouldn't necessarily refute your point that legacy students are majority white as of now, but we can see the system becoming more refined and less biased in that sense. 

When it comes to athletes, we first need to clarify the comparably VERY small amount of recruited athletes. Out of all the athletes in class of 2022, only 12% were recruited. When we see the sports mainly focused at Harvard, let's use Football, the dominant players are not primarily  Asian for a variety of socioeconomic and cultural factors, although there are notable exceptions. Again, I wouldn't necessarily refute your point but it's skewed to fit the narrative presented in the case. 

If we're going to mention athletes, we also need to mention other extracurriculars not directly recruited for but definitely an important aspect of an application. Based on the cost prohibitive aspect of music careers, we could assume whites and Asians are more favorable candidates. But again, not meaning to further skew data as I'll explain later, And unfortunately Harvard doesn't directly offer data sets on it. 

When saying ""tough"" backgrounds it's racially insensitive to suggest the overwhelming majority are non white and non Asian, as over half of the class of 2022 are on financial aid. It might seem as if different demographics fit into the ""tough"" background stereotype but plenty of Asian students are unfortunately in that situation as well and there's no definite data to back up the point of view that these students are primarily non Asian or non white, just stereotypes. 

And if we take a look at the lawsuits, none of these points are really brought up. The main argument is that they're discriminated on the basis of character. For some reason, data is skewed against Asian applicants in character scores where whites and other ethnicities consistently score higher. The admissions office seemed to display a pattern of assigning lower scores to Asian applicants basically calling them ""uninteresting"". The debate is wether the systematic lower scores of these Asian applicants are based on a bias against them based off stereotypes such as""tiger parents"" or coincidentally, Asian applicants seemingly lack personality based off cultural factors that pressure them in the college application process. 

The factors you've described are constantly being accounted for by the admissions office and should ideally not exclude Asian applicants. While I don't think Harvard is necessarily racist in their AA methods, they do raise questions as to the factors being weighed in scoring Asian applicants based off character.

"Anti-Asian Bias, Not Affirmative Action, Is on Trial in the Harvard Case",miamiedge,"Hi! Disagreement! It's a good theory but it doesn't pan out.

The analysis for the defense (Harvard) is done by professor Card (of Berkeley), for the plaintiffs, professor Arcidiacono (of Duke). Arcidiacono’s baseline sample excludes individuals who enjoy highly preferential treatment in admissions (e.g. legacies, athletes) and the many individuals who have probability 0 of admission based on observables. Card includes all applicants in the sample. That's analogous to studying the effect of a minimum wage law, except that instead of constructing the employment-to-population ratio of a subpopulation likely to be affected, you include the entire population (including individuals who have probability 0 of employment, like infants, and people making tons of money). Interestingly, the infants don't seem to react to the minimum wage law, so our results are attenuated toward 0.

(P.S.- There are a lot of other more complicated things in Card's use of the data that is unorthodox to say the least. Such as including individuals for whom covariate X does not matter attenuating the true effect of covariate X on those individuals for whom it does matter and refusing to accept a panel data study because supposedly admissions processes differs year-to-year (really?). Running separate regressions for a bunch of years, failing to reject the null in those separate regs, and claiming an overall null result is highly suspicious.)",12,,1539529108.0,e7qy2rn,False,False,1539527066.0,2018-10-14 09:24:26

> Since we know there are certain groups in the US who have been historically disadvantaged, it seems pretty reasonable for admissions to favor, for example, a female Hispanic candidate over a white male candidate for a given “spot” if they’re both qualified. 

If that was the case, then logic would suggest that given the applicant pool size wouldn't, say, Hispanics be the largest group as they've managed to overcome the greatest social difficulty? Yet they account for only 12% of the accepted pool. 

Out of 42,000 applicants and 1950 accepted, that's 228 Hispanic students accepted compared to 975 white students, or a rough 4.3:1 ratio.

And wouldn't that suggest that all else being equal, the majority of Harvard students would come from disadvantaged backgrounds or overcame poverty? The reality is a far cry from that. 

My response to that is, wouldn't it make FAR more sense just to make it an *actual* meritocracy? They already examine social background (plenty of white socially disadvantaged students), parental income, read background and supplemental essays, examine high school school's average standardized test scores, and all of that. They can clearly see who has overcome adversity without setting artificial boundaries of ""we are only going to accept X number of students of this ethnicity this year"".

Why not make it an ACTUAL meritocracy? As you said, admission teams aren't using a process of elimination. They can simply say ""let's choose the best 2000 students of this group"" and make it ACTUALLY FAIR by eliminating something that really has no reflection on their academic or social capability.

These are irrelevant because admissions *doesnt* look at all of the students in a demographic and compare them to each other. If harvard was using a quota system you’d be absolutely correct, but that is not the case. 

It’s also important to consider that there is no objective way to pick the “best students” — a lot of this debate assumes that grades and test scores make someone “better” or more qualified when it is just the case that since these measures are quantitative and therefore easier to work with (though the accuracy of these measurement tools is also debatable!)",4,,1539365256.0,e7nah31,False,False,1539364854.0,2018-10-12 12:20:54

2) Who are you to say what education should or shouldn’t be? As I’ve already stated, merit isn’t limited to just academic merit, and academic merit (though easier to measure than other types of merit) is still not something that can be captured with 100% accuracy. (Consider that grade inflation is actually more pronounced in more affluent, privileged communities, and that the SAT is inherently flawed.) Furthermore, why should someone who’s gotten unfair advantages for the first 18 years of their life continue receiving advantages? If someone overcomes certain disadvantages associated with being low income or a racial minority, they should get credit for being successful in spite of all of the hurdles they had to overcome. 

3) If we want to consider every student on a “complete” basis, identity is an important piece of the complete student.  

Fighting social injustice and inequity is always going to make those who have been previously receiving advantages feel “disadvantaged” because they’re losing their head start/advantage/favorable status. ",3,,False,e7niolc,False,False,1539371700.0,2018-10-12 14:15:00

>2) Who are you to say what education should or shouldn’t be?...Furthermore, why should someone who’s gotten unfair advantages for the first 18 years of their life continue receiving advantages?

Again, then the current logic would suggest the roughly 50% of Caucasian student count should be dramatically lower as they've had advantages in the first 18 years of life. More significantly, it would be currently suggesting that Asian students are much more advantaged than Caucasian students in the first 18 years of life. Neither of which sounds accurate to me, and again-- standard of life and difficulty is already addressed outside of race in the application process.

Finally, the question you have STILL yet to answer: Why is race even a factor if students list their background, familial condition, income, whether they're a first generation uni applicant, and essays? There are existing schools which have eliminated race as a question from applications entirely such as MIT, and it doesn't seem to have burnt down or be filled with Aryan master race students. Let's face it, most of this discussion is rationalization. The fear, in reality, is that Asian students would ""overrun"" the school once racial quotas stop being counted.

The problem with taking time off right now is that there is no guarantee you will be able to do any of these things. 

If you didn't already have a desire to take a gap year before and want to take one now I would encourage you to write a list of the things you want to do. If you think you have enough stuff you want to do or try and you think you can do all that during a pandemic I would say 100% go for it.

What do you wish you had known as a freshmen?,crharvard,"People have touched on the social and emotional bits in this thread. Lots of great comments. I guess I'll talk about academics. 

In terms of broader academic tips: Harvard is a much more fulfilling and worthwhile place when you know what you want to study and what you want to pursue after college. You'll be able to tailor your experience starting from day one to maximizing your success in your concentration and connections in your department (especially if you want to do things like research). You don't need to be a super academic person for this to be important for you. Whether you want to spend time on academic research, industry career opportunities, politics/policy, art and creative pursuits, etc, once you know what you really want, you'll be able to pour time and go in depth on that thing and not waste too much time running around everywhere else. And time at Harvard is very valuable. It's 8 semesters and you're out. I'm a senior and it's crazy to me how quickly the time flew by.

Exploration is good! I am not at all trying to discourage that. I have done my fair share of curiosity driven exploration in creative writing here, even though I am STEM focused. But as far as primary pursuits go, I know people who have run around the whole gamut of concentrations and opportunities, and while it's more or less worked out for them in the end, their time at Harvard has been much more stressful and a little less worthwhile than it could have been. The freedom Harvard affords you with your curriculum is great, obviously, but it's sometimes a curse when you can't figure out what you exactly want to do. Other colleges with more stringent major requirements lock you in early on, which I think for some people is strangely beneficial.

Maybe you are already very sure what you want to do. But if not, try to narrow your interests to a couple things prior to arriving, and explore those things while you're here. Keep an open mind, and try to identify things that you feel really excited and motivated to work on! But do so by keeping in mind that it will be best to commit to something early on. 

In terms of less broad, more detailed, day to day academic tips, my advice is sorta common sense, but something I wish I had really stuck with early on (common sense isn't so common lol): 

1. GO TO CLASS, ALL THE TIME. Connect with your professors and faculty by going to their office hours; they WANT to spend time with you and discuss the material, and you will love your education so much more for it. Some are intimidating, but embrace the discomfort and go talk to them. You'll be surprised at how FEW of your peers actually do this. You'll thank yourself when you're searching for recommendations later on. 
2. Start your work EARLY; assignments are going to get much harder and more involved, and you'll need to spend time grappling with questions. This ain't high school work anymore. In most cases, your academic success will start to depend less on your innate intelligence and more on your diligence in starting work early and getting help in office hours.
3. Make sure you understand things YOURSELF when you are working with others. In some really hard classes here, I see people routinely just getting trickle down answers from the few geniuses in class or generous TAs in office hours (cough cough CS124). Working together is great and all, but try to make progress yourself first before seeking assistance. 
4. The timeline for locking down summer opportunities/internships seems to get earlier and earlier every year. Start thinking about summer stuff the fall before summer (and if you're into finance and tech stuff, start the spring of the year before the summer in question -- I know, it's ridiculous).
5. Practice time management skills prior to arriving by using a planner and/or online calendar, and find out how to do work in a style that best accommodates you (I'm a big proponent of the Pomodoro technique). It's still going to be difficult adjusting if you are the type to push yourself. But most get the hang of this throughout freshman year; you'll be fine. 
6. Try not to take more than 2 highly demanding courses each semester. Sometimes this will be hard, especially because more often than not courses are only offered during fall or spring, not both, and there may be courses you don't want to delay taking. If you plan on taking 3 (or god forbid 4) demanding courses, cut your other obligations. You will thank yourself so much for it. You will do BAD work if you are constantly sleep deprived from excess obligations (not to mention you will be miserable too).

I fully admit that academics are the most important thing to me here. Not everyone cares this much about school, and that's totally fine. And some will disagree with me that early specialization is important; that's fine too, but the point stands that you will get better at something the more time you spend on it. These are the things I really wish someone had told me before I came. I turned out fine and will be going to a great grad school, but I could have avoided lots of stress by following the above.",9,,False,flv2beu,False,False,1585514912.0,2020-03-29 15:48:32
What do you wish you had known as a freshmen?,Omnideficient,"Don't beat yourself over kind of a crappy first month. Or even first semester... or first year. All of us come in with the intent to do everything! see everything! make the 'most', whatever that means, because you're wasting time if you don't. Then you get here, and things are harder than you thought they were, and by the end of a day, you're feeling so tired that you're not up to doing the four other things you planned to do that day. You start feeling like if you don't do everything you could possibly make yourself, then you're not doing enough, and that's a crappy feeling.

It's not like it's super easy to explain why, either. It's not just the people who weren't well equipped who feel like this, for one. I 'expected' it would be hard in these ways. But for lots of people, it will subvert your expectations in funny ways, so it almost becomes a matter of 'did I really *expect* this, since I've never felt this way before?' Not to get really philosophical about what it is to 'expect' though - it just feels different. It's a novel kind of growing pains. It's growing from great new feelings, ofc, but also growing from crappy new feelings of inadequacy, and maybe a little sadness, and then remorse over how you withdrew when sadness starting affecting you.

I know it hit me hard to not be in control of how I felt all the time, as someone who has always operated on feeling in control. In short, Don't beat yourself up over things going not as expected (like I did most the first half of the year, pretty badly). Of course, it's different for everyone. I happened to have bad home dynamics going on in the background that were stressful, and have finally started coming to terms with some things about my mental health that I should be conscious of. And of course, I had so many things I loved about this year, and even with everything going on right now, it ended on a great note. I have a blocking group I love and laugh with and some amazing people in my corner (lots in other years, through my ECs) who help through dark times.

You use my.harvard to find classes, and you will see a link to a class's ""course evaluations"". Every semester when you finish a class, you rate the class and its instructors, log how much time you spent on it each week outside of class, and write a review on it. This data is published in the course evaluation system, so you'll be able to see it for each semester the class has been offered. There are classes where the average workload is 2hrs a week, and there are classes where it is over 25 hours a week (for one class!!!). You'll see all this in the course evaluations. This is also how you can tell if a class is actually good/well taught, i.e. if its overall score is greater than or equal to 4/5, and if the reviews are mostly positive. But most people will take some intro classes which have sub-4 ratings that you have to take because they're concentration requirements; there's no way around this but it won't dominate your experience.",3,,False,flv6mmx,False,False,1585517475.0,2020-03-29 16:31:15

Lawrence S. Bacow named the 29th president of Harvard,ModernMrDarcy,"EDIT: I didn't realize this would be such a controversial point. Please allow me to clarify. 

As president, you set the tenor and helm the university. I believe that Bacow is qualified to do so, as are a great deal of the other candidates. I am not opposed to his nomination in any way. I would ONLY like it if someone who is not a white man was nominated, someone who can understand the positions of a black or brown person, and better adjust policy in that way. Harvard has a lot of institutions that were made without minority groups in mind, and some legacy things that are specifically built on the backs of enslaved minority groups. I'm not saying that Harvard remains guilty of racism. My point is that never once, NEVER ONCE, has there been a president who has been able to SPECIFICALLY empathize and guide policy looking out for minority groups on campus. THAT is the reason that one might oppose him, not because of what his qualifications are, but because of the passing over of minority candidates who would do an equally good job. This is not me saying I believe the selection board was racially biased, nor that it should be. I am merely expressing regret that a thing I wanted to happen didn't happen, and I feel as though the response has been both out of character for the Harvard community I know, and informed by my own comment, which was poorly worded. I apologize if you were misled by my original comment, but if you are still offended by the sentiment of my clarification, I would love to talk about why in a constructive setting.

End of edit.

Nothing specifically against him, he seems remarkably qualified in the ways you've pointed out, but I would have liked to see a person of color and/or another woman as president.

"Since Harvard no longer accepts AP credit, is earning a Masters in 4 years feasible?",crharvard,"Concurrent Masters is basically the new Advanced Standing. In a way, it's actually fairer since it doesn't require that students have x amount of AP credits in order to do a masters. And it's also not that much harder -- you're allowed to double count 4 courses for your AB and AM/SM. Both CM and AS require 8 grad classes in your field, so there's no difference to how many grad classes you need to take. (side note -- I think some concentrations allow like \~2ish of your 8 grad classes to be upper level undergrad classes)

It's very hard to do, though. I know only know a handful of people who are doing it, and some are considering dropping. Undergrad classes, especially in STEM concentrations, are already challenging and time consuming. Taking 8 grad classes in one field on top of that is really frickin hard. If you want to do a masters and a secondary, you essentially need to have your plan of study pretty much locked down from day 1 . Even for just a Masters, you need to know pretty early on that you want to do it so you can plan out your semesters appropriately. You do not want to squish a shit of ton requirements your last 3 semesters or so.

I would strongly advise against it *unless* you think you would already be taking the courses anyway. Then, by all means, do it. And once you're here and you get a feel for what classes are like, you'll be better prepared to evaluate whether you want it in the first place and whether you're comfortable devoting that much time to it. But don't push yourself to do it just for the clout. And if you think this will be exceptionally helpful for grad schools, taking just a few grad classes of your interest plus devoting quality time to your research will prove much more fruitful. In my experience, the 4 year masters is something that sooooo many freshmen think about pursuing cause it sounds cool and worthwhile, but very few end up doing it.",7,,False,fnk3sji,False,False,1587014127.0,2020-04-16 00:15:27

He was helped, eventually, by medication, but it took a few weeks to take hold. Once he was out of the worst of it, he was able to taper off the meds. I don't know if that's right for you, just that I know one person who was helped. (Also, if you're not happy with the therapist/counselor you're talking to, ask for someone else. Sometimes it's just not a good match.)

Depression isn't just being sad, it's this weird lens that distorts everything in your life. So don't blame yourself for the way you feel or don't feel. Hopefully with help you will find your way back.

Also, there's a blogger/cartoonist named Allie Brosh who did a couple of posts on her experience with depression, which might resonate with you. (She draws in this deliberately child-like way, but she describes experiences as an adult.)

withdraw is a strong pull, doing the opposite is especially good medicine. staying around new friends and not isolating yourself will aid you while you get appropriate and therapeutic help. most importantly you need to remember in the bleakest moments that you are young, at an excellent school and your whole life is ahead of you. with appropriate intervention, it is highly statistically likely that you will move past this

Shitty Semester?,pinkturtles16,"Hi! I’m a sophomore and I 100% relate to your feelings. When I got in, I thought that Harvard was the happiest place on Earth and that it would fix all my problems. I was wrong. I also come from a shitty public school and I was not as academically prepared as some of our peers. I didn’t know a single person before coming to campus. I developed really bad social anxiety (which I had before, but it got worse not knowing people) and that made me feel even more isolated. My grades have been so crappy and, for the first time in my life, I’m genuinely struggling academically. This semester I finally went to CAMHS and I’m in the process of getting an ADHD diagnosis, which was previously masked but is now kicking my ass. Academics haven’t gotten better for me yet... I feel you. Socially, I still haven’t found a best friend or an insanely close group of friends, but I have found communities on campus and I’m building stronger relationships. This semester, I just forced myself to be more social, to reach out to people, to participate in clubs, etc. It was really scary, but I think it’s paying off. Also, I don’t have summer plans yet!

I don’t know if any of that was helpful, but I just wanted to communicate to you that **you’re not alone.** There are so many people on this campus struggling, but we just don’t talk about it a lot. **Be kind to yourself.** Enjoy the little things**.** You’re only going to be here for a small part of your life—try to get some cool memories, but know that in the end your time here doesn’t have to define you or your future.",10,,False,famvr0e,False,False,1576214304.0,2019-12-12 23:18:24

Shitty Semester?,mfabasicaf,"Other people already spoke well to the mental health side. Here are a few logistical suggestions:

1.) Take easier classes. It used to be cool in HS to take the hardest classes you could, it’s not anymore. Especially if you had less academic preparation in HS, take a really easy load next semester. The Q Guide is your friend here. 

2.) Go after unofficial summer positions and less prestigious locations/organizations. Even with the Harvard name, it’s really really difficult to get internships when you have to apply as a freshman. Chances are, if it’s a company/organization you’ve heard of and has an online application, they’re getting 100+ applications mostly from uperclassmen. Either find organizations/startups that most people haven’t heard of, or find internships that don’t have applications by emailing people at organizations you like that don’t have postings and asking to intern with them. That way you won’t be competing against 100 seniors. 

3.) Join campus clubs that have multiple years of students. First year programs and friend groups are great and all, but all-frosh friend groups are fragile af and they won’t be able to help you with academic advice or navigating Harvard systems. Having even a few uperclassmen friends will replace what those advisors are supposedly for and will lend some stability to your social circles.

Academics-wise, I definitely second the advice to take easier classes - it’s not high school anymore, there are no rewards for pushing yourself too hard.  Also make sure you’re taking classes that interest you and that you WANT to put in the work for.  When I came back for sophomore year, I switched from taking classes in the concentration I thought I “should” do to classes that I actually was excited about, and holy crap it made so much difference in my willingness to work and therefore my grades.  And take advantage of office hours, with TAs as well as profs - it’s what they’re there for and it super helps!! - and look to form study groups if your entryway-mates or other people you know are in the same class. 

Mental health wise - if UHS isn’t helping, what about exploring some of the peer counseling options on campus?  I would also talk to your RA (or whatever they call the person who lives in your entryway, it’s been 10 yrs and I’ve forgotten) and your academic advisor - they could be good sources of help.  Agree that PAFs probably aren’t a great resource for this.  And just remember - loads of other people are in / have been in the same boat as you.  The social experience freshman year is HARD! 

And don’t worry too much about your summer plans!  Virtually nothing depends on your freshman summer.  I can’t remember anyone’s freshman summer internship.  Personally, I didn’t figure it out until May, planned to work on a political campaign at home, the candidate ended up losing his primary one week into my internship, so I worked as a part-time secretary for a random lawyer friend of my parents and did a whooooole lot of nothing.  And it was fine!

If I could give myself advice in my first year: Don’t stop seeking out guidance. Going to therapy on campus for the very first time in my life really helped me out and I wish I had gone sooner. Get involved in organizations to meet people, they may not be *the people* for you, but they could introduce you to someone that might be, just hang in there. Also, stop checking social media for a year — no one is actually having a better time than you and it just makes you more anxious. Lastly, stop worrying about what other people think about you — and put yourself out there! It’s uncomfortable and really hard but it’s a really great life skill and no one is judging you as hard as you’re judging yourself.

Yet, I doubt if I left GSAS Special Student out of my résumé, a recruiter would rant about it. 

To me, this suggests that the 2,917 HES degree candidates sometimes face unfair hiring discrimination because they may be grouped with the 25k non-degree students and try to avoid it by leaving out the Extension Studies part. 

I think degree candidates should include something that distinguishes them from other schools in order to accurately attribute part of their accomplishments to HES, but should also be able to more explicitly distinguish themselves from non-degree students possibly with a degree name that reflects what they have studied, or by changing the school-name résumé guidance based on degree vs. non-degree. 

Additionally, in most cases, I wouldn't call it deception, rather a way to more clearly distinguish themselves from non-degree candidates (though extreme examples like listing an AB or AM are inaccurate). As long as the degree candidate is listing ALB or MLA, I think that should be enough to credit the Extension School for a part of the student's accomplishments. Admitted HES students represent 13% of Harvard University degree candidates, only behind the College (30%), and GSAS (19%), so listing Harvard University shouldn't be an issue. I see most people throughout the University list Harvard University, rather than their school, on their résumés and then list their degree (at least on Wikipedia, Facebook, and Linkedin).

""I agree with you. At my company specifically we do a lot of recruiting at the college and HBS (separately) so maybe they hope to fall between the cracks.

I pulled the resumes from the internal application system. The full time recruiters only get access to the Harvard system, and I'm not fully sure what that looks like or what they do, since I'm not a recruiter. All I know is, I clicked filters for Harvard College and noticed a filter for Harvard University as well, and pulled resumes from there, and out of the hundreds that I downloaded, the 25 I got that listed Harvard University were all extension. There's many more to go so maybe it's more rampant than 25, or maybe it's only the 25 I read. But 25 HES grads who have applied since July 1st is still kind of a lot, imo.

Just to be clear, I'm not a recruiter for my company. I am a PhD doctoral student and I just followed our recruiter's directions for what the process is, and that's how I ended up getting those resumes.

>I doubt anyone is really going to be fooled. Harvard College usually have it front and center on their resume, recruiters and employers are privy to the game as well, if HC is what they desire.

Got a bunch of resumes from Extension graduates who don't list the Extension School (rant),firstplaceloser3,"HES has been around for a hundred years or so but is still relatively unknown on campus. They grant degrees but put ""liberal"" in the title. Whereas students of the College/GSAS earn an AB/AM, Extension grants the ""ALB"" or the ""ALM."" 

It started out as a way to outreach and provide affordable education to the surrounding community but has more recently morphed into a ""back door"" into Harvard. The diplomas look identical except for the word ""liberal"" in the degree name, and they graduate at regular commencement with all the other schools. The main difference (and what causes the controversy) is that the admission rate is higher than all the other Harvard schools, but that doesn't matter to most employers outside the New England area who aren't familiar with the difference. It's a legit Harvard degree and the H-bomb magic works the same, but anyone geographically close to the campus or in the know will understand the difference. Maybe some think the quality of the student is different, but I say that if the work was done and Harvard sees fit to give them the seal of approval, then so should we.

From what I understand, there are a ton of people that sign up for open courses through HES, but not many actually graduate with degrees. It's BS for someone to sign up for an open course and claim to have attended.

>You distinguish yourself from non-degree students by listing the degree you’ve earned or are in the process of earning.

True, my issue is that it needs to be more clear that earning a Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies with a field of study in Government is much different than taking one course as a non-degree candidate, say, American Government, and listing Harvard Extension School, American Government on a resume. It only serves as a point of confusion for recruiters unfamiliar with how the school operates. 

> The biggest problem I have with “Harvard University” over “Harvard Extension School” is that HES is a drop down option on our online app. Not one person chose this option, everyone self-entered Harvard University into the box.

For this point I would still say that its an issue of distinguishing oneself from non-degree candidates since the vast majority of students at HES are non-degree candidates. One perspective could be that if there's a 10% chance that someone listing HES is a degree candidate, but a near 100% chance that someone listing Harvard University is a degree candidate, and you're a degree candidate at the University applying to jobs with recruiters that are pressed for time, why wouldn't you list Harvard University to make more clear that you're degree-seeking student or an alum and make yourself easier to find? 

Recruiters like yourself probably are not a fan of searching through 10 resumes in search of 1 degree candidate, so degree candidates try to make it easier on you and heighten their chances of being reviewed by categorizing themselves into a pool of candidates that they can still honestly identify themselves as (""Harvard University"") and which is much more likely be filled with degree candidates. The mistake comes when they don't list their sub-category within the University to credit the Extension School with their academic accomplishments.

> The main difference (and what causes the controversy) is that the admission rate is higher than all the other Harvard schools.

I feel like applying the traditional admission rate metric (the data is not available for HES in the first place) as a measure of selectivity in the case of HES fails to accurately represent the school's non-traditional admission process. 

A measure that would better allow the comparison would be the proportion of students admitted that first began courses with the intent to apply.

Further, the ""application fee"" (three required courses before application submission) is around $4,350, so you would see selection bias within the applicant pool for individuals that would be very strong candidates in the first place.  

>It started out as a way to outreach and provide affordable education to the surrounding community but has more recently morphed into a ""backdoor"" into Harvard.

I appreciate your knowledge of the history of HES. However, I have to disagree with you about it morphing into a ""back door"". There are no backdoor, unwarranted admissions into the University, only a diversity of paths to admission. I understand how non-traditional processes or ideas can be scary or taboo for a time, but I guarantee you the process is creating value for HES students, students at the other schools, and the University as an organization, while driving positive change in the wider educational environment. The geographic, cultural, and background diversity at HES is unmatched as is also the case with the flexibility students possess with regard to their studies.

Got a bunch of resumes from Extension graduates who don't list the Extension School (rant),Dkennemo,"Ok.

Probably also at work is that many people have surmised or suspect that they'll get more hits if they use ""Harvard University"" as a label because that is the search term people use and it isn't an untruthful statement outright so it isn't going to run afoul of most people's scruples.

And as far as the whole AM / ALM or AB / ALB distinction some people are failing to make, well, *I* wouldn't do that because it crosses the line for me, but they are probably rationalizing that it is content-wise the same thing (ie it is a proxy for the equivalent body if course work) and it is a search term more likely to be used.

If you're a current student (I just went through this process last year), you enter the schools you attend or attended. The next question that pops up is something to the effect where you check either degree-candidate or non-degree. So no need to differentiate there - the application already does that.

I also didn't mean back door in a negative way. It's a total back door. I wouldn't call it ""unwarranted,"" but the fact is that it is easier to get in to Harvard through HES than any other way. But I wouldn't say it's easy to make it through to graduate, and therein lies the difference. 

The Gazette had an article a while back about some dude who graduated this year that came from a broken home, had a super interesting personal narrative, then spent years commuting from his home in Texas while working full-time and finally finished with straight A's. That's incredible. According to the article, he is now headed off to graduate school at Yale. Apparently Yale thinks HES is legit enough. That guy, and I'm sure most of the graduates of HES, could probably compete with the HC students as far as being smart and interesting. It seems to me they just did it later in life. 

Unfortunately, there may be a stigma for those guys among more traditional members of the campus (and their employers) as they go out and seek jobs. I don't think that will bother them as they will just overcome the adversity like I suspect most of them already have. It really surprises me that any of them would lie and try to say they had an AB or AM. It seems like they should be proud of what they earned.

The way the filtering work is that in the application, you choose your school (college/HBS/HGSE/HES). There is an option to fill your own option in (for applicants at schools without their own filter) and this leads to the problem I faced. HES students self enter Harvard University, creating its own filter that I picked. 

Moving forward I won’t be using that filter since it had only been used by HES students (and the instructions I got today for resume review make no mention of this filter - just says to check Harvard College).

The big problem for me lies within the fact that HES students were not choosing the appropriate filter and self typing Harvard University instead.

Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias.

Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance.

Also keep in mind that the Harvard subreddit is likely to give you a highly skewed perception of life at Harvard. Yesterday I posted about how to launder money with my crimson cash account—obviously that was a joke, I figured out precisely how to do it months ago.

How to be happy at Harvard,HeliosPh0enix,"Those sad reddit posts are definitely an exception, not the rule. Most people at Harvard are very happy, whether it be with big friend groups or a few good friends. And don’t worry about people only being into social justice and liberal arts, many of those people are just more vocal at the start. In STEM majors and STEM classes, you’ll meet plenty of nerdy, geeky people into the same things you are. The cool thing about Harvard is that pretty much everyone you meet is going to be into both STEM stuff and liberal arts because of the nature of the school itself, so you’ll have things in common with almost everyone. If you still want to do stuff at MIT, you can cross register for some classes there to broaden your experience. I do ROTC so am at MIT for that several times a week and it’s a nice change of scenery. I never had many friends in high school and I’ve been having a great time here. Long story short, you’ll most likely be fine and really enjoy your time at Harvard.

The idea I was floating (which people apparently hated, based on the score my post got), was increase the size of the College.

What I was getting at is if you look at the quality and size of the applicant pool, it seems apparent that there are way, WAY more people who are qualified to attend who could add something positive to their classmates' experience, than who can be admitted. This isn't news - it's just that it's gotten to an extreme level now.

Gdavtor's point is well taken - there is a certain collegiality that is lost when you over-populate -- why scale up if it would cheapen the experience for everyone? And without scaling up the physical plant to match, he is correct. My line of thought was this, though: any one person's experience of Harvard is going to be a product of his or her interactions with classmates, people who live in the same House, who dine together, or otherwise interact. There is no way that any one student's experience of Harvard entails all 1,600 students in that person's class. Were student services scaled up, you could avoid the negatives of overcrowding that might give people pause.

This would be expensive. Harvard has to work hard enough to maintain the physical plant it's got, and they're not making more land in Cambridge. That said, the university benefits from all these bright minds being together, and that's the counterbalancing factor. Is the benefit of bringing more bright minds into the community worth all the work it would be to preserve the experience for its members?

Radcliffe is a different situation, since it had a clear purpose: making Harvard coed. Arbitrarily increasing the student population size doesn't have a clear purpose and just puts more strain on campus. For example, not every freshman could live in the Yard, which is a Hallmark Harvard experience.

Harvard culture seems a lot less ""social justice""-y to me than the stereotype of liberal arts colleges. Some student activist movements do happen, and they tend to get more national attention than a similar movement would at a less famous school, but they're movements of specific student groups, about which the student body as a whole often has mixed or lukewarm feelings.

I planned to study gov freshman year, but didn’t love the classes.  So over the summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about what I *wanted* to learn about - like, what topic would I read a book or an article about during my free time - and ended up totally pivoting to linguistics (realizing that, while I was trying to parlay a love of languages into IR, really what I liked was the language part).  I was soooo much happier taking classes in a field I loved, and I did better in them and got more out of them because I liked the topic more.

""Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

Like all of you, I have been intently following reports of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and considering the many ways in which its future course might alter my life and the lives of those closest to me. These past few weeks have been a powerful reminder of just how connected we are to one another—and how our choices today determine our options tomorrow.

 

Fortunately, a group of extremely dedicated people has been working literally around the clock to respond to the challenges posed by COVID-19. Our teams are considering every contingency as they undertake their important work, and I write today to update you on major near-term changes that will limit exposure to the disease among members of our community:

 

We will begin transitioning to virtual instruction for graduate and undergraduate classes. Our goal is to have this transition complete by Monday, March 23, which is the first day of scheduled classes following Spring Recess.
 

Students are asked not to return to campus after Spring Recess and to meet academic requirements remotely until further notice. Students who need to remain on campus will also receive instruction remotely and must prepare for severely limited on-campus activities and interactions. All graduate students will transition to remote work wherever possible. Schools will communicate more specific guidance and information, and we encourage everyone to review prior guidance about both international and domestic travel.
 

We are transitioning over the course of the next few days to non-essential gatherings of no more than 25 people. Please note this is a change from prior guidance.
 

The decision to move to virtual instruction was not made lightly. The goal of these changes is to minimize the need to gather in large groups and spend prolonged time in close proximity with each other in spaces such as classrooms, dining halls, and residential buildings. Our actions are consistent with the recommendations of leading health officials on how to limit the spread of COVID-19 and are also consistent with similar decisions made by a number of our peer institutions. The campus will remain open, and operations will continue with appropriate measures to protect the health of the community.

 

For regular updates and additional information, please visit this dedicated webpage. Provost Alan Garber, Executive Vice President Katie Lapp, and HUHS Executive Director Giang Nguyen will continue to send you updates by email as needed. You will also continue to receive School- or Unit-specific information from local leadership. If you are a student or faculty member and have specific questions or concerns, I encourage you to be in touch with the contacts identified by your dean. If you are an employee, I encourage you to be in touch with your manager.

 

Despite our best efforts to bring the University’s resources to bear on this virus, we are still faced with uncertainty—and the considerable unease brought on by uncertainty. It will take time for researchers, a good many of them who are our colleagues, to understand enough about this disease to mount a reliable defense against it. Now more than ever, we must do our utmost to protect those among us who are most vulnerable, whether physically or emotionally, and to treat one another with generosity and respect. Please remember that Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services and the Harvard Employee Assistance Program are available to help you manage anxiety and stress. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.

 

To our students, I know it will be difficult to leave your friends and your classrooms. We are doing this not just to protect you but also to protect other members of our community who may be more vulnerable to this disease than you are.

 

To our faculty, I recognize that we are asking you midway through the semester to completely rethink how you teach. We do this because we know that you want to avoid putting your students at risk.

 

To our staff, I understand that we are expecting you to go above and beyond in your efforts to support our important mission of teaching and scholarship. We do this because we know we can rely on your creativity, flexibility, and judgment through these challenging times.

 

I am proud to be a member of a community where people put the greater good above their own self-interest. Thank you for your patience and your resilience as we all learn to temper increased distance with deeper care for one another.

 

With appreciation,

Larry

Why not do socioeconomic affirmative action instead of race?,suavegoose,"That will never happen for multiple reasons. 

First, even if they wanted to, the SAT gap between rich and poor students is twice as large as black and white students. To admit a large amount of low-income students would mean the school would have to lower their standards even more than they do for special interest groups they already preference. 

Second, poor students are less likely to become future donors that the school can draw from for financial support. Therefore, there's no incentive for them to do so. 

Third, and most importantly, the whole point of going to Harvard and similar schools is to surround yourself with the wealthy elite. Low-income students benefit by meeting these kids, being brought into their circles, and forming life-long connections with them. 

Kahlenberg's model would make Harvard 50% economically disadvantaged. Rich kids don't want to be surrounded by poor kids and they would just go elsewhere. That other college would become the \*new\* Harvard.

Politics isn't a quality that some things have and some don't; it's a lens through which to see things. And Peterson has thrown himself into the political sphere, so it's a fair way to criticize him.

Also, you don't know what Marxism is.

Peterson claims that Marxism is related to postmodernism as both ""claim that power structures govern society."" This is a truly inane statement. Every political philosophy seeks to explain power. Post-modernism rejects the existence of a telos, which is 100% antithetical to Marxism. I would even say that post-modernism is anti-empirical, which is so in opposition with Marxism, I can't even find the words to emphasize it enough. They are related in the same sense that Darwinian evolution is related to young-earth creationism. 


Marxism fundamentally posists that there is a “logic” 
to history, and that it was possible to get on the “right side” of the historical
process by carefully interpreting its inner dynamics and figuring out where one
stood on the timeline of development. Marxism also sees that the all social orders are built on economic structures; that the development of “productive forces” propelled societies forward; and that societies would evolve from their primeval origins

On average, they are of comparable difficulty. I switched from Biological Engineering to Computer Science at MIT during my sophomore year. With no prior experience in programming, I'm graduating with a good GPA and a somewhat stable job (COVID has introduced uncertainty). Graduate school is definitely an option for me, in case that's your M.O. Comparing notes with friends at Harvard has led to the conclusion that the core CS curriculum is of similar difficulty. MIT has notorious outliers that are amongst the toughest CS classes that exist, but they are not required to graduate, such as 6.172 Performance Engineering and other graduate-level electives.

Harvard or MIT for an undecided (but leaning towards comp sci) student,crharvard,"As a senior, I would echo everyone else's comments that you should take into account other aspects of college. Personally, although looking back Harvard wasn't the best school for me among the options I had (I got interested in CS and EE during college, but I do not like SEAS here), I did not want to attend MIT because I didn't identify with the overly geeky/nerdy culture, and I wanted more academic diversity in the student body. I also really like the house community here, and I think it makes for a much more enriching social experience. So all in all, socially, I think Harvard trumps MIT for my taste. But seeing as you're the type to apply and get into MIT in the first place, maybe the MIT community is just what you're looking for.

Academically, to me the situation depends on how much you're invested in studying CS. I think no one would disagree that MIT is a better school than Harvard for CS. The CS department at Harvard has really talented faculty doing great research, but I don't think they have their undergrad pedagogy really figured out. Many of the courses are notoriously poorly taught, and the elective offerings are few and far between. Additionally, the department is heavily bent toward CS theory at the expense of programming, and a lot of my friends and I have had to look toward other resources (projects, internships, online classes) to hone our programming skills. MIT is great at both theory and the practical parts of CS, and they have elective offerings that span all areas of CS. (you'll never hear about MIT students cross registering at Harvard for a CS class --  why would they? lol)

Like u/Willing_Breadfruit mentioned, I also think that a lot of the Harvard CS classes are harder than the MIT ones (but not better!). So I don't think it's necessarily true that by choosing Harvard you're gonna have an easier time with your courses; quite the contrary in many cases. One major difference is that MIT's majors have a higher number of course requirements than do Harvard's. But Harvard CS courses tend to pack a lot more material per class than MIT, so overall, it probably evens out as far as the total work you have to do. But I think MIT's more spaced out degree plans give you some more breathing room, as well as a chance to do well in more courses and give yourself more time for certain subjects by spacing them out across multiple semesters. But on the other hand, Harvard is more generous with grades (people *rarely* ever straight up fail classes here, whereas at MIT there's a non-trivial amount). Additionally, because the CS degree here has fewer total requirements, you'll have more room in your schedule to take whatever elective courses you want outside of CS. 

You mention you're just leaning toward CS, so Harvard could definitely be better for other interests, especially if you have interests in non-STEM fields. You should let us know what your other interests are, and, as I said above, what social climates you think you might prefer. If you came here telling us that you wanted to focus solely on CS, and academics was the most important thing to you above everything else, I'd tell you to go to MIT. So more information is needed here, IMO.

P.S.: You don't need to be an awesome programmer to major in CS, anywhere! I didn't program before coming to college. But of course, I'd recommend you spend time getting better at it, as it'll only help you hit the ground running when you get to college.

**EDIT:** Notice how everyone is saying ""you can always take CS courses at MIT by cross registering"", as if there's an expected deficiency by doing CS at Harvard that you'll need to make up for. Cross-registering is obviously great, but it's not as easy as people make it out to be. The 2 schools don't share the same schedules, and the \~15 minute commute + time waiting for transportation can add up when you have a busy schedule, not to mention the fact that you'll need to go there multiple times a week for things beyond your lecture meetings, like section and office hours. Not a huge deal, but something to consider. Moreover, I personally hate the idea of having to go out of your way to supplement your courses. So all in all, I don't think cross registering is a perfect solution to make up for the difference between the two schools, but again, this only really matters if you want to really focus on academics.",6,,1586401845.0,fmujodx,False,False,1586392733.0,2020-04-08 19:38:53
Harvard or MIT for an undecided (but leaning towards comp sci) student,Visible_Professor,"Hi! CS undergrad, Software Engineer at FANG, and back to grad school here. My personal preference would be MIT for CS undergrad.

Edit: o wow. People here really don’t like hearing contrarian views huh. I’m gonna guess most of you are undergrads? First off, in SWE, name brand matters less. You see high school dropouts making it in tech. Forget about credentialism. If you ever did a google internship, you’d have noticed you see a lot of kids from Cal Poly or Waterloo. They are ranked like far far down as a comprehensive uni, but their CS pedagogy is strong enough go mint new SWE by the batch. So no. Choose the program that suits your pedagogical tastes. I just think MIT has a slight edge in trying out mew ways to make you think about these things.

Harvard or MIT for an undecided (but leaning towards comp sci) student,prefrosh202444,"If you're leaning towards STEM, I'd wholly recommend MIT. While Harvard does have a strong pure maths department (Harvard/MIT interchangeably place first for the Putnam every year), MIT's strengths lie in its CS and engineering for undergrad, and its \*made\* to be accessible for ""newbies""! Your first semester would be pass or no record, and your second would be A/B/C or no record, allowing you to ease into your college and social workload. 

The culture of MIT is also extremely collaborative, and I'd generally advise against relying on cross-registering with MIT should you choose Harvard as its 1) logistically challenging (needing to subway back and forth – the T stops in Kendall square instead of along Mass ave., meaning its a significant walk to and from class, excluding how far you have to walk to Harvard Square from where you are on campus; the class schedules don't mesh well together) and 2) culturally unnecessary (as your CS friends at Harvard would likely be taking CS-50 and p-setting together, and you shouldn't spend all your time on MIT's campus).

Harvard 2024,,"Environment: 

it was nice to meet people who spent a lot of money on school apparel to advertise where they attended. People were nice. I mostly hung out with the pot heads and party crowd. Those are my kinds of people. People are just like any other college but I sensed we all shared a common goal, to be successful in what we do and to leverage the name to get us through closed doors.

My workforce experience:

Here's what will help manage your post graduate expectations (I was a grad student there bc I wouldn't have been admitted as an undergraduate. I was a party animal with average grades and no volunteering or significant achievements).

I make the same amount of money as my fellow colleague who graduated Michigan State University with an MBA. I work in a tech role as a manager for cloud. 

When people at work hear you're an alum:
People start listening to you in the room when you speak when they know you're a Harvard alum. But that romance only lasts for 1-2 minutes after introducing yourself. Then everyone is like well you had better be the next best thing since slice bread or we will write you off smart guy.

So be humble because you will meet some people who are smarter than you. I will admit, at least in my opinion,  I only got in Harvard because I filled a ”quota” and the timing was spot on and all the stars aligned. The universe had spoke to me and said...”this is your time now my child, go forth, and do not fck this up.”

In retrospect, it was a bit more expensive than it should've been for what I do. However the networking made up for that through higher offers which were facilitated by target companies (FAANG) feel like we should add Microsoft in there too. 

Working at big name companies versus a F500, well, I personally enjoy more established companies bc it feels more relaxed and less intense. I make relatively less money but I only work 40 hrs a week. That time vs money trade off was worth it for me.

The University will also sell $1.1 billion in bonds, according to a report last week from Moody’s Investors Service.

Its flagship faculty, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, has already netted $30 million in expenses and lost revenue due to the pandemic, leaving it unable to cover its yearly budget, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced last week.""

I understand that the endowment funds those things, but it literally *is* just a collection of cash and financial assets. A lot of the endowment is restricted in how it needs to be spent, but the incentive is to spend as little as possible because the gains belong to the general fund which is discretionary spending.

For example, as of 2018-2019, Harvard's net assets are $49.3 billion, of which the endowment is about $39.2 billion. So most of Harvard's value is tied up in that mountain of financial instruments, with about $10 billion being the net assets of everything else. If Harvard were to disburse $3 billion of its endowment, then the endowment would have $36 billion and the net assets would remain unchanged.

A lot of people think ""endowment"" means ""all of a university's assets"" and posts like OP's contribute to that.

We have great special dinners probably once a month or more and we have extra special dinners once a semester for traditions. That’s the Holiday Dinner and the Charles Eliot Dinner. Always something to look forward to!

Eliot Fête is probably one of the best memories I have of Eliot. It’s an elegant formal held in the courtyard. The entire place transforms for one night into a swing ballroom replete with classy cocktails and chocolate strawberries! The best part of it is that it is all student run so it ends up being very personal and special.

What’s The Best Thing About Your House?,oajm,"Sophomores are guaranteed n-1 housing (or possibly better). For your group of 6, this would mean 5 rooms. A room is counted as either a bedroom or a common room. It would be unlikely to get a suite with 4 bedrooms and one common room because there are very few rooms like this in Eliot house. All suites have one bathroom.

More likely, you’ll get two suites next to/near each other. At its worst, this would be one room that has a bedroom and a common room and another room with two bedrooms and a common room. Often, people convert these common rooms into singles. They are likely walkthrough singles, but not necessarily (bc Eliot had weird architecture). At best If you are lucky, you could get two suites with 3 rooms each that each have two bedrooms and one common room.

In the housing lottery, generally seniors pick first and then juniors. The rooms that are left are given to the sophomores. The way that Eliot structures the lottery leaves lots of 3 room suites left and odds and ends that weren’t picked up by the upperclassmen and a handful of rooms reserved for sophomores. 

You guys could go into the lottery as 6. You could also consider going in as 2 groups of 3. The two groups of three have no guarantee of being near each other, but you can note a preference to be near another group on the housing form. Because I said there are more 3 room suites left over at the end of the lottery, you might (no guarantee) have better odds of each getting the three room suites with this move. You could also run the risk of each getting two room suites. It’s sort of the high risk, high reward option imo.

What’s The Best Thing About Your House?,gacdeuce,"House community: Mather is far from the Yard and other class buildings. But we walk together from classes, eat together more frequently in the dining hall, take the Mather Express together. If you like partying, Mather is very good for that because of the many large common rooms. If you don’t like partying, no worries, you have your own single that is removed from the common areas by stairs and concrete. I can’t really comment too much more about community because I graduated almost a decade ago, but these are generic enough. Talk to current students if you want info on what the current community is like.

Dining Hall: I’ve heard the staff has changed a bit since I was there, but the food is generally better. Why? Simple. It’s not part of the central kitchen. The kitchen for Mather only cooks for Mather and Dunster. Lower volume allows for higher quality food. Also, the dining hall is never too crowded. It may take more convincing of your friends to get them to come out to Mather, but they don’t have community hours and don’t need them. I was a chem concentrator and had early classes. One of my great joys and memories from college was sitting in Mather dhall for breakfast and watching the crew teams go by on the Charles. Compare this to a crappy dining hall like Quincy that’s overrun by members of other houses, freshmen (no offense), and grad students. 

Views: the tower has the best views of Cambridge, hands down. 

Other features: it has a student art gallery in its lobby. The house library is spacious. There are many small group spaces (study rooms, music rooms, meditation room, multiple small dining halls) for student use. It has multiple causal common areas in the house with TVs, a pool table, and ample seating for people. It has a kitchen you can use in the JCR (my roommate once burnt some food and set off the fire alarm). We have two large laundry rooms. You can get from any room (except the apartment) to the dining hall without going outside. It’s close to the river and Central Square.  You are far from the main campus (furthest non-Quad house), but that means you’re very close to the river, some restaurants (Zoe’s for example; awesome breakfast), and Central Square (lots of great places to go out here, too).",7,,False,fn39r7w,False,False,1586616172.0,2020-04-11 09:42:52

Education Department Investigating Harvard, Yale Over Foreign Funding
Officials accuse schools across U.S. of soliciting funds from foreign governments, companies known to be hostile to the country

The Education Department opened investigations into Harvard and Yale as part of a continuing review that has found U.S. universities failed to report at least $6.5 billion in foreign funding from countries such as China and Saudi Arabia, according to department materials viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The investigations into the Ivy League schools are the latest in a clash between U.S. universities and a coalition of federal officials including law enforcement, research funders such as the National Institutes of Health and Defense and Energy Departments, and a bipartisan group in Congress that has raised concerns about the reliance of higher-education institutions on foreign money, particularly from China.

A Harvard spokesman said the university is working on a response. A Yale spokeswoman didn’t immediately have a comment.

The Education Department described higher-education institutions in the U.S., in a document viewed by the Journal, as “multi-billion dollar, multi-national enterprises using opaque foundations, foreign campuses, and other sophisticated legal structures to generate revenue.”

Officials accused schools of actively soliciting money from foreign governments, companies and nationals known to be hostile to the U.S. and potentially in search of opportunities to steal research and “spread propaganda benefitting foreign governments,” according to the document.

In addition, while the department said it has found foreign money generally flows to the country’s richest universities, “such money apparently does not reduce or otherwise offset American students’ tuition costs,” the document said.

U.S. officials say China uses a variety of means to target academia, including government-funded talent recruitment programs such as the Thousand Talents Plan. The arrest last month of the chairman of Harvard’s chemistry department on federal charges of lying about receiving millions of dollars in Chinese funding through the program while the U.S. shelled out more than $15 million to fund his research group catapulted the issue into the spotlight.

In a letter to Harvard dated Feb. 11 and posted on the Education Department website, officials cited the recent Justice Department case and asked the school to disclose records of gifts or contracts involving the governments of China, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran. It also requested records regarding telecommunications giants Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. of China; the Kaspersky Lab and Skolkovo Foundation of Russia; and the Alavi Foundation of Iran, among others.

The Education Department said Yale had failed to disclose at least $375 million in foreign funding after filing no reports from 2014-17, according to a document viewed by the Journal. The department, in a Feb. 11 letter to the university, sought records regarding contributions from Saudi Arabia, China and its telecom giants, Peking University’s Yenching Academy, the National University of Singapore, Qatar and others. It also asked the university to detail foreign funding of Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center and the new Yale Jackson School of Global Affairs.

If the schools refuse to disclose the information, the Education Department can refer the matter to the Justice Department, which could pursue civil or criminal actions.

I’m just about to join the fall cohort of TIE students and appreciate your viewpoints. My particular reason for doing the course is using as a springboard for a career change from the classroom to media/tech. I probably fit the bill for what you described many of your classmates wanting to do when they left.

Knowing that it’s going to be such a short stint and the fact that I’ll miss the J term (heading back to New Zealand for a wedding) I’m starting to feel the crunch to maximise my networking already. I’m already pesting as many people as I can on LinkedIn and making the most of the Harvard email account.

"Review of Harvard Graduate School of Education Technology, Innovation and Education Program",beonewithyuri,One of the biggest differences I found is that MBA/JD/MPP etc. programs are way more career centric than an Ed.M. All of those multi year programs typically have a summer internship which is more likely to set you up with a job at graduation. The Ed.M teacher certification tracks are more likely to provide set employment than the other non teaching concentrations. Also the internships I saw at HGSE were more experiential within a startup or smaller company. Keep in mind that many of those roles were paying in the 50k per year range and often involved moving to a different part of the country.

What's your advice to the incoming first-years?,ynwa11235813," 1. Set some goals early on in terms of your health. For example, I will only get ice cream x times per week, I will get x hours of sleep per night, I will only drink x nights per week, etc. These goals don’t have to be super tough, but it’s really easy at college to form new habits, so it’s best to make them good ones.

2. Don’t worry if you feel lonely at some point. It takes a while to make friends that you actually feel close to, but a lot of people act like best friends after a couple weeks so it can seem like everyone is fitting in except you. Just know that eventually you’ll find a group of people you like.

3. Don’t feel bad about having free time. It’s okay to not be doing homework for 12 hours a day even if it seems like other people are. Take time to do things you enjoy even if they’re not productive.

4. Get a bike/scooter if you can afford one. It makes things a lot easier if you ever plan on going off campus.

5. Do primal scream. I’m pretty self conscious about my body, but I decided to just go for it and it was a lot of fun! 

6. Finally, don’t feel bad about quitting clubs. A month or so after you inevitably sign up for 18 clubs at the activities fair, think about which ones actually make you happy, and focus on those ones.

good sides of Harvard?,actekin,"Former transfer student here. I did my freshman year at Georgetown and the rest at Harvard. Both great schools, but I’ll focus on my experience at Harvard here. Full disclosure: I was class of 2015, but I don’t have any data points to suggest it’s changed that much.

Harvard was the most nurturing intellectual environment I have been a part of, and it has to do with the people as much as the resources. The resources point cannot be understated though—within a 15-minute walking radius you basically have some of the best experts in any field you can imagine, and that translates into great dinner conversations and extremely abundant opportunities if you’re willing to put in even a minimum amount of effort. The school is simply overflowing with opportunities (scholarly or otherwise).

Is it competitive? Yes, but not not in a cut-throat way. You simply have quite a number of capable and deserving people applying for the same positions/fellowships etc.—but the saving grace is that there are so many of those anyway. 

I guess there are pockets within the huge student body that can translate into bad experiences for some, but I found it very easy to avoid those. Just to anticipate a concern OP might have, apart from my walks back to Eliot, the existence of final clubs did not even cross my mind for the most part for instance.

With that being said, I’m really against the university’s actions against the clubs. I was never a member and never attended a party, so I don’t have any real ties to the clubs, but I can’t understand exactly what Harvard’s grievance is against them. If you’re worried about sexual assault that’s one thing, but in the past few years it seems that the fight against the clubs has moved away from that aspect. You have male clubs and female clubs - is there inequality between them due to practical constraints (ie the cost of real estate for a house)? Absolutely, but i certainly don’t think the solution to this inequality is banning or throttling club membership.


I think Harvard will probably win any lawsuits on this front, but I don’t think it’ll win Harvard anything tangible.

(If this weren’t the case, we wouldn’t need to recruit them!) We should first cut the programs that most stack the deck for prep school kids (sailing, skiing, crew) and the ones that oft-injure their players (football).

I agree with football. It's objectively harmful. I was devastated by what happened last year. 

As for sports with high barriers to entry like sailing, skiing, and crew, I don't believe Harvard should simply abolish those because they skew high income. Yes, I acknowledge that classism in athletics is problematic, but that doesn't mean we should ban or ignore certain sports outright. I think sports are still valuable extracurricular outlets/activities. I know a lot of girls who are great athletes and super passionate about rowing.

For my last Crimson column I just wrote a bunch of loosely connected Harvard-related hot takes,thedietitian,"Hey Trevor! Here's my super respectful challenge to your comments.

>We should adopt Stanford’s “open-door policy” for alcohol. It’s absurd to think that banning alcohol from the Yard will stop freshmen from drinking rather than making their habits more irregular and dangerous.

I would say I'm generally in support to promote safer drinking practices, but I will have to look at the data and rationale behind the policy before I make a conclusion. I will ask my psychopharmacology professor what he thinks and get back to you. Overall, however, we still need better drug & alcohol education to dissuade students from making poor decisions in the first place. I feel like that's an important first step. I'm a psych major, so I have familiarity with the psychopharmacology of alcohol and other drugs. From a strictly health perspective, it's better not to drink because alcohol has little to no nutritional value as well as profound disinhibiting effects.  

>Harvard should abolish General Education and foreign language requirements. They mostly serve to add headaches and complexity to the process of choosing classes, which should be driven by actual intellectual interests or practical concerns.

Do you think we should be more like Brown with the open curriculum?

I respectfully disagree. Personally, I love the GenEd program. In fact, I'm now a psychology concentrator because of the whole system that forced me to explore courses outside my areas of interest. I also just took my very first philosophy course this semester to fulfill my ER requirement, and I'm honestly surprised by how much I love the discipline. I'm that kind of person who thought philosophy was a waste of time before taking a course in the field. I think a lot of students either take the wrong courses (stuff that's not compelling or memorable) or choose classes for the wrong reasons (e.g., they're gems, it's an easy A, no work, etc.). Especially with the expansion of the GenEd program to accommodate more courses, you can still take classes in a broad range of disciplines that still align with your personal interests. You can take the classes you want to take while pushing your intellectual boundaries.

>Relatedly, as Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker wrote in a 2014 article in The New Republic, Harvard should refocus admissions away from extracurriculars and intangibles and toward academic potential, mostly measured by test scores and grades (even if I would not have gotten in under this regime).

Do you want Harvard to resemble CalTech, whose admissions system is based on this approach? I'm just curious!

Personally, I like Harvard's admissions policy just the way it is. We still have very high academic standards in the admissions office. However, Harvard also searches for passion and diversity of interest to create the most amazing school possible. We have such a vibrant student and extracurricular life because that's what Harvard wants. Harvard wants to train diverse leaders for a diverse society. We're all about academics and extracurricular excellence. I think we'd lose such a part of the culture if we solely focused on academics in admissions. This school has so much personality.",3,,1543912002.0,eb234fk,False,False,1543911345.0,2018-12-04 02:15:45

For my last Crimson column I just wrote a bunch of loosely connected Harvard-related hot takes,literallytrevor,"Thanks for what is indeed a very respectful reply!
1) Alcohol definitely has dangers, but I have two responses. First, the optimal amount of drinking is not zero, because people enjoy it, so it has benefits as well as costs. We should be focused on targeting drinking for which the costs outweigh the benefits, i.e., drinking to excess and avoiding medical help. In my own experience that has been echoed by many people I've talked to, banning alcohol meant that when I did get alcohol I would try to capitalize on that limited access as much as possible. Make it less special!
Second, banning alcohol does not necessarily lead to less binge drinking. See actual prohibition.
2) I had Brown in mind, yes. I suppose I have more faith in the ability of fellow Harvard undergraduates to choose their own courses: people continue exploring new disciplines long after their gen eds are satisfied, for example. And I think abolishing gen eds would lead to a reduction in easy A's and gems! Those are overwhelmingly concentrated in gen ed programs. Though I do think non-gen-ed gems exist for precisely the goal that you seem to have: getting students to take classes outside their concentration, exploring in low-stakes environments.
3) I think Harvard would still be markedly different than CalTech, just as Harvard's graduate student body—which is admitted on very similar admissions criteria to the ones Pinker and I are proposing—is different from CalTech's. As Pinker argues, admitting the highest academic achievers  would mean getting a whole lot of passion and diversity of interest! Nerds are not boring. In fact, I'd argue that the people with the *least* passion and diversity of interest that I've met have been recruited athletes, the group whose numbers would most decline under my proposal.
I agree that we would lose a part of the culture, but I disagree that this culture is worth saving. It's a culture of filling up your resume with extracurriculars by vastly overcommitting and never specializing. One of the most common complaints about Harvard culture that I've heard is exactly this pressure to find a dozen extracurricular engagements and continue them until you get leadership positions (see my previous column ""Asking the Right Questions"")—which we've of course been trained to do, because that's how many of us got admitted in the first place. Admitting a population that actually studies more and joins fewer clubs sounds like a healthier, more productive, and happier culture to me.

For my last Crimson column I just wrote a bunch of loosely connected Harvard-related hot takes,literallytrevor,"Good questions, but I am not worried about that potential. I think those are good outcomes. Black students wanted to live in the same house (Pfoho, iirc) for understandable reasons: it was presumably a more comfortable environment with a stronger community. It's very strange to me that the administration decided to break that up, seemingly for the benefit of white students who needed more diversity at the expense of black students who needed a safer house.
I also see absolutely no problem with final club members living nearer their house. Or athletes living nearer the athletic complex. Or Jewish students living near Hillel, etc. These reflect choices people make for good reasons!
Finally, this self-segregation already happens *within* houses. Walk into your nearest dining hall, and you'll likely see final club bros sitting together, athletes sitting together, blockmates mostly hanging out with each other, and some degree of racial self-segregation. It's not like randomization created a utopia where people constantly interact with people unlike them (and it's unclear why this would be a utopia!).
Edit: by ""it's unclear why this would be a utopia,"" I mostly mean that people naturally prefer to hang out with people who share their extracurricular/academic/personal interests and personalities; not referring to race or SES.

What's your LEAST favorite thing about Harvard?,H_throwaway_p1,"Made a throwaway to reply to this. Goddamn it's so fucking true. Brief disclaimer: you can for sure find people here who are nice and genuine and sincere.
 
But there are a large number of people here, more than I've ever encountered in one place before, who (for lack of a better metaphor) lack **substance**. They are almost like ghosts - they seem real at first glance, you snap your fingers, and suddenly their transparency is evident. In true Harvard fashion, these people are invariably friendly and will greet you whenever they see you, even though they would walk around you if you were bleeding out on the floor as so to avoid staining their shoes. But there isn't any way to hold the briefest of conversations with them. Unless you are higher status than them, where higher status involves being invited to parties and having over 1000 Instagram followers, they just don't want to know.

It feels like a large number of people here are compensating for the fact that they were unpopular in high school by attempting to metamorphose into some kind of party animal/raging asshole. I think I was just shocked by the shallowness of it all - that these people who were quite antisocial when they were younger and under their parents' thumb get into Harvard, come here, and then decide to completely change everything about themselves in an attempt to create an image of some A-getting worry-less party gremlin to climb some pointless social ladder.

How bad are online classes?,SmartRefuse,"This is a bit of a loaded question, so I'll just give my two cents on what I think you should consider. Yes online classes are not the same as in-person. None of the experience is. You can still learn all you need to know, but I've found that discussion-based classes are kinda painful. However, that may just be a product of the emergency sat/unsat system, which means people don't really have an incentive to do readings. Who knows if that will continue in the fall.

You should think hard about your own situation. I used to say that I would take time off if classes were online in the fall, but after some reflection I realized I would be better off graduating and getting a job sooner rather than later. 

You should think about what ""normal college life"" will look like post-covid. Will the class of 2025 be abnormally large, and how would that affect you? Will covid/social distancing become seasonal? Will online learning be combined with in-person learning? What's your biggest grievance about online learning, and can you be certain that waiting a year will solve that? There's speculation that social distancing will be enforced if colleges come back in person. 

You should think about what you're going to do with your life during a gap year. I know people who take them in a normal situation oftentimes travel or have a project they're working towards, so how will you make the year more valuable than it would be doing online learning? Is your plan for how you will spend your time worth delaying your graduation by a year?

Ultimately you have to weigh the costs and benefits of each route for yourself. I have decided to swallow my pride and get on with it -- you may be feeling robbed of the college experience you wanted, but the situation is not unique to you. My own decision was swayed largely by the fact that I already have some momentum in the job search, and a semester off may compromise that. Obviously yours will be different as you are an incoming freshman.

Be critical of your own thought processes and think about the big picture. Good luck with the decision!",60,,False,fqtpw2l,False,False,1589643777.0,2020-05-16 10:42:57
How bad are online classes?,clementine_,"I honestly think the quality of online classes is a combination of the instructor's skillset - and, how students approach it. I am an alum now, and part of an organization that is still having incredibly rich training, community building, and collaboration online. But, I go into other spaces where participants have cameras off, don't speak up, aren't prepared, are multitasking. It's awful. I think the quality of students' experience will depend on the community and norms they build. I hope that Harvard freshmen will rise to the occasion.

And of course - instructor skill with creating that collaborative environment is key as well. So shopping period, and really judging if the professor is ready to own the transition to online learning is essential.",12,,False,fqtyduw,False,False,1589648489.0,2020-05-16 12:01:29
How bad are online classes?,thelonelycerebellum,"Hi OP, rising senior here. I just completed my junior year online. I personally experienced a rather smooth transition to online learning, but I'm strongly considering taking time off if classes are online again.

There were definitely some aspects of online learning that I enjoyed. I certainly had more spare time to complete assignments, and I relished learning at my own pace. It was easier and more productive (in my opinion) to watch lecture recordings when I felt like it than to attend a bunch of lectures in person. All of the stressors that I experience on campus just went away, and I was able to direct 100% of my focus toward schoolwork. I'm not saying this was a completely positive thing, and obviously not everyone had the same experience. I know I'm very lucky to have a safe home and a supportive family. 

I strongly disagreed (and still disagree) with Harvard's decision to impose mandatory sat/unsat grading on us. (I'll spare you my soliloquy but let's just say that people struggling this semester have gotten more sympathy and accommodations than anyone who has struggled with equally tough issues in semesters past.) I don't think that we'll have another sat/unsat semester in the fall because both students and faculty will have a lot more time to prepare for online learning, but if we do, I am definitely taking leave.

Honestly I'm not 100% sure what I would do if I were you. Compared to older students who may need to be on campus for research, recruiting, etc., you may not have as much to lose from an online semester. That said, half of the value of a Harvard education is found in experiences that take place outside of the classroom. Friendships, extracurriculars, networking -- those are things you can't necessarily replicate online. I'm not sure what you're looking to do on campus, but I know personally that none of my extracurriculars translate well to Zoom. And screw all the curmudgeons commenting on Crimson articles that ""spoiled Harvard students"" need to suck it up and accept that the university doesn't revolve around us -- we and our families have sacrificed so much to attend Harvard, and there's nothing spoiled or selfish about wanting to be able to take full advantage of its opportunities.

Something additional that we both need to consider: if we were to take time off, would we be guaranteed a spot in spring 2020 or fall 2021? I don't think we know yet. Unfortunately I can see Harvard coming up with a system to disincentivize leaves.

Class of 2024 Waitlist Usage,Huge-Sell,"I've never thought of it that way. Completely makes sense. Assuming all of this is true, what would the waitlist numbers look like this year? I've been talking to a lot of admits, and many seem quite adamant in taking gap years if there is an online or hybrid semesters. By defer, I don't mean giving up the offer of admissions, but rather doing '25. If students did that, Harvard would just fill those vacated spots with waitlisted people. This seems like the only logical reason why a school like Princeton would go to waitlist this early when they didn't even use it last year.

 Also, compounded with the incoming recession, wouldn't that also contribute to smaller enrollment across the board, and thus more waitlist movement. Obviously, the recessions wouldn't have as large of an impact on the ends of the income brackets, in terms of ability to pay tuition, as much as it would for the average middle class working family. For low income admits, Harvard would meet full need, as it is the richest school in the world, and recession or not, the very wealthy still have the means to pay for school. It is the middle class that have to make financial sacrifices due to partial aid that I see being most affected. Do you think these admits could contribute to a situation causing lower enrollment? I had friends who were forced to turn down Wharton and Stanford due to financial problems last year, so it isn't out of the question for someone to elect not to take loans, and forgo Harvard., especially given the current economic climate.

If anything, they will not accept many, if any, people for z-list and instead accept those admits directly into the class of '24.

The brother of President Lowell (of Lowell house and the entire house system fame), Perceval Lowell, lived in my old room. So did US Olympic Hockey Team member, Noah Welch. Ulysses S. Grant lived in the dorm. 

Holworthy is very close to everything, but especially the science center (and therefore Cabot Library) and Annenberg. It is farther from Lamont, but not too far. It is very far from the MAC. For this reason, many Hokworthians used the Hemenway gym near the Law School. The law school library was also a common study once for some Holworthians. It is split into three entryways, Ho East, Ho Middle (or Ho Central), and Ho West. The entryways are not connected. There is a common space with a kitchen in the basement, but the basement can’t be accessed from inside the entryways, you had to go outside and around between Holworthy and Canaday. When I lived there, you had to use the Thayer laundry rooms. 

Each room is a two-bedroom suite for four people (no singles, which is unfortunate and has a common living space. The suites are large, and the bedrooms are large enough to debunk. Each suite is connected to the other suite on your floor by a hallway where the shared bathroom is. Each floor is all male or all female (as of 2007-08). This means that if you keep your hallway propped open, it’s like having an 8-man suite. If you get locked out, it’s not uncommon to knock on your neighbor’s door to cut through to your room, but this can get annoying if you have a neighbor that forgets his or her keys frequently.

It is vitally important, however, that applicants be qualified.

So I am cautious about the suggestion that Harvard itself can solve the problems of public education. It is not the right entity to do so. But for well-qualified applicants, it seems obvious that there will be significant societal benefit to considering the challenges of socioeconomic context out of which an applicant nevertheless excelled.

Of course, an applicant's high school record is fully visible to admissions officers, whereas her/his commercial prep services are currently not.

Harvard Undergraduate Experience,makosako,"First of all, congratulations!!!

Second, please don’t be discouraged by what you have read or heard so far. I graduated from Harvard this past May and spent the next few months wishing I could go back and live over my time there again.  This is not to say that the things you have heard are wrong, but they also don’t paint a complete picture of what my experience was, at the very least.

I was a premed, and it’s true that there are some cutthroat people in that community. But it’s also true that I’ve met and made friends with some of the most wonderful, selfless, caring people who were also premeds. One of my best premed friends, who I met at the beginning of freshman year, has been nothing but supportive to me these past four years, to the point where we’d always celebrate each other’s accomplishments instead of envying then, and always turn to each other in times of trouble instead of tearing each other down.

I applied to many clubs in freshman year, and was rejected from quite a few of them. Yet the ones I eventually joined were such loving, friendly communities that by sophomore year, I’d forgotten the sting of rejection and instead spent the next few years trying to give back to my club communities so that new folks would feel as welcomed as I did.

I took classes with some professors who never knew I was even there. But I also took classes with professors who would reach out to me without my asking to see how I was doing, or to schedule a time to chat about my career or my concentration.

I’m rambling a bit, but I hope I’ve made it clear that even with all the annoyances and grievances and troubles, both big and small, my time at Harvard was full of amazing people and wonderful experiences. Really, anywhere you go, there will be all sorts of negative moments, but ultimately, the quality of your college experience is really up to you. Whatever you decide to do, I wish you well.",22,,False,ei8q2rl,False,False,1552262079.0,2019-03-10 18:54:39
Harvard Undergraduate Experience,the_bririonman,"Hey, class of 2021 here. 

Use visitas to your best opportunity and get a feel for the school.

You should always remember that people are more likely to talk shit about their school, especially when they have very high expectations. No one talks shit about Harvard like its students. 

But, I also don't want to disillusion you either. I've observed a lot of the things you're worried about, so to be honest there is some truth in the perception. Yes it's very hard, socially and academically competitive, exhausting, stressful etc. But it is definitely manageable. STEM classes here are definitely hell though, but I'm pretty sure STEM is hell everywhere. Try to use this time to think critically about what you want from the Harvard experience, and let that guide you through your time here. You can definitely mitigate the bad by finding an environment where you feel comfortable.

About the dorms: yeah most suck, and a few are nice, but the nicest ones are all the way in the quad. Dorm quality is radically inconsistent depending on the house, location, etc. Oh also no air conditioning. Move in is always the absolute fucking worst.

About the food: lol yeah it does suck ESPECIALLY Annenberg (where you'd getting your food all of frehshmen year).  It might look like Hogwarts the food certainly doesn't taste like it. Also tourist sneaking in through the back door while you're just tryna eat lunch is annoying. But get used to bold tourists. They're everywhere, especially in the yard. But they sure do make for funny stories!

About the Harvard Vloggers: LMAO pay them no mind, their content is comedically ridiculous. Both I and many of my friends have made fun of that stupid ""why 4.0 at Harvard is a failure"" video. They exaggerate a lot to make things more interesting, but I can tell you it's really not that deep. Honestly I haven't heard anyone say particularly nice things about the vloggers and their content.

You'll do fine wherever you end up, just focus on your own college goals and you'll be ok. Lmk if you have any questions since we'll be on campus in the same era. Good luck!!",9,,False,ei9ca4i,False,False,1552282150.0,2019-03-11 00:29:10

Harvard Undergraduate Experience,TrunaDragon,"Heya, class of 2022 here – I'll try to give you an honest rundown of my < 1 year so far lol, but as a potential visual arts student most of the academic stuff I can say probably doesn't apply to you. I do know that a lot of concentrations (CS included) are criticized for being too theoretical and not practical. However, no college is perfect, and I cannot stress this enough. Harvard's flaws are just even more disillusioning than usual because of the ""Harvard"" name.

&#x200B;

The social atmosphere is what you make of it. I have the most wholesome, incredible roommates who I'm so lucky to be blocking with next year, and I couldn't have asked for better friends or supporters in my first year. I've joined all the extracurricular groups I wanted to (the Crimson, HSA, the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, etc.), and I've met amazing friends in all of them. My only limitation is that I overcommitted, lmao, which is absolutely a personal problem since I'm not taking cutthroat STEM classes or anything.

&#x200B;

I know you can meet amazing people anywhere, but I feel like being immersed in a community of great peers is an aspect where Harvard is almost unparalleled. ""Amazing people"" doesn't just mean everyone's a genius; the most important consequence of this, for me, is that people **dedicate themselves to the extracurriculars they commit to.** There's less flakiness, more passion, and more interesting things happening on campus because people, on average, try to make time for a more balanced academic life.

&#x200B;

They bring in Richardson's ice cream consistently every Sunday, there are KBBQ ""Bistro Bowls,"" sweet potato tots, etc. There's rarely a day when I dislike everything on the menu. I like to think I have decently high standards for food, and I literally do not know how other people are getting that Berg is horrible.

Harvard Undergraduate Experience,brokecollegekid69,"Hey man I’m a grad student at HES and IMO the experience is just like any other university. Yes there are smart people and they may be competitive (making generalizations as I did not go to the college) but I did my undergrad in engineering at Rutgers and the students there were equally competitive. Remember in general terms, everyone is competing for the same jobs and opportunities at this level (be it ivy or another large university) so it’s natural to be more competitive that HS. With that said, I don’t think that it will impact your experience. You will still be able to make friends and join clubs and take full advantage of what Harvard has to offer. 

Again from a graduate perspective at HES, everyone has been supportive and engaging in my time at Harvard. Classmates are great, professors are interesting and the overall experience has been phenomenal.

This is very true. It’s what *you* make of the experience there is what really matters.

Viewing videos of John Fish saying how his 4.0 was a failure actually could be looked at that self care is more important than school work.

Pretty much go and enjoy the amenities and experiences offered (meeting friends, going to parties, whatever you enjoy) and dont stress over school work.

For example, D. Gaitsgory is famous for making it a brutal class with students averaging 50+ hours a week on the homework alone. But other profs who teach it often just treat it like any other honors freshman class. 

Regardless of who teaches it though, the actual material is somewhat tame (looking back on it at least). It basically covers Sophomore level math (Real Analysis, Group and Ring theory, Topology, and Manifolds). There are other freshman classes that cover most of those topics (e.g. Math 25, which I took), but the difference is how in-depth Math 55 goes. It typically teaches the material at a much more mature level, closer to an upper level course or graduate course. This is because it expects the enrollees to be already very familiar with the proceedings and conventions of higher math. The homework is also *significantly* trickier than any other freshman math class.

Harvard vs mit (cs),Visible_Professor,"This became a long-ass post.

tl;dr: *Think long-term. Think of what you envision doing in twenties and what field in CS  that makes you feel great.*

Hi. I'm an incoming graduate student. I feel the need to help these cute duckling aspiring CS undergrad students :)

I did a CS undergraduate, worked in FAANG as a software engineer for half a decade. I've been an interviewee for FAANG, then an interviewer for my company, and gave too many interviews I lost count, made hiring decisions, turned down several ivys and Stanford (hehe), and hired several non-target grads. I feel like I am qualified to help people reach this decision (seen more than one MIT vs Harvard CS posts), as I've struggled myself with figuring out if I want to be academic or industry, and how to achieve success and excellence.

Both are fantastic programs, and you can't go exactly wrong in either. I've also seen my friends from both schools go on to successful careers in tech. That said, the devil is in the details.

For example, do you think you might like compilers? Do you like to work on demanding kernel-level code to squeeze out some performance gains and relish that? Do you like to pore over the details of, let's say, speculative execution and figure out if implementing that with X amount of L1 cache is worth it? Or do you think you want to create a new algo for an unsupervised learning method that can increase the target success rate? Etc. These interests might actually help you make the difference of whether you want to attend MIT or Harvard. Some have professors that are stronger than other. And the labs you worked in, or the prof you worked with for your senior thesis will make a difference in what you do in your first few steps after undergrad, and that will start building your expertise. So that's where things come down to.

Lastly, I decided not to pivot to management/generalist too early in undergrad. It served me well. CS and tech now is a very deep discipline and takes a while to build up deep knowledge that is hard for other people to replicate and steal/replace you. You will literally become so indispensable because of your expertise, that they have no other option than to give you that raise, and make Facebook, say, outbid you by 100k cash bonus with more in stocks to steal/retain you. So, even if you want to make a lot of money doing Venture things, I'd advise you to stay technical for majority of your twenties, and plan bigger. At least that's what I believe in, and has served me quite well.

Feel free to PM me for any advice, for what it's worth.

Harvard vs mit (cs),sunfl-wer,"a lot of these commenters are from harvard (understandably, since were on the harvard sub), but I think there are a lot of assumptions being made about mit culture and social life. here are thoughts from a current mit student:

while harvard and mit culture are definitely different and mit gets the more nerdy or socially awkward rep, when I came to MIT, I was surprised by how “normal” a lot of of people are. yeah, some of these kids are geniuses that grinds their way through high school, but that doesn’t mean they don’t know how to socialize or be a normal person. in a similar thread, I saw a commenter describe mit as more blue collar than harvard, which I agree with completely. there are many many kids from public schools, first generation students, immigrants, etc at mit which I believe makes the community a lot more diverse and welcoming to everyone 

it’s hard to convey through stuff you see through mit, but there are so many groups on campus and you can definitely find a social group that will fit you. also there are a lot of different dorms that each have their own culture, but that’s something you need to be in to understand. the i3 videos imo are pretty cringey and aren’t a great representation of each dorm. 

a very large percentage of campus is affiliated (~50% of men, ~30% of women), and the frats and sororities have different cultures, but the greek community is very real and it’s easy to meet new people through it.

as for business school, mit let’s you take classes in sloan as an undergrad, so you can get a head start on these and figure out if that’s what you want to do, as well as make connections that can help you into sloan or any other top business school. 

for internships, I’ve honestly never felt like I was competing with my fellow mit students for spots. even when we’re interviewing at the same time for the same position, it’s more of a “I hope we both get it” mentality instead of “I need to beat them” mentality. I really doubt companies have a limit on how many mit students they’ll accept. also, having so many cs students just means you know more people at more companies, which is a plus to me. i can easily get a referral at top companies just by hitting up friends

Harvard vs mit (cs),crharvard,"I said this in the other thread, and I'll say it again. I think MIT is better than Harvard at undergraduate CS pedagogy. But no, you will NOT be disadvantaged when it comes to jobs. All the major tech companies, and many prop shops, HFs, quant places, all come here as well and hire plenty of kids, as long as your skills are up to par. Please do not let this be the deciding factor. I can't tell you how many kids I'll see from Harvard if I look at DE Shaw's LinkedIn page. (it's still hard to get into those places, btw, no matter how great your school is, but Harvard only improves your chances) And when it comes to tech and quant recruiting, the school you attend will help you a lot at getting an interview, but during the interview, it's all up to you. So I'm telling you -- this doesn't matter.

I know this is a really tough choice. I can't tell you what the right one is, unfortunately, and I agree that cross-registering is an imperfect solution. On top of the logistical hassle, you also just want to be attending the school you chose to attend, not supplementing it by going somewhere else for a bunch of classes. Plus, things like finding groups to work with can be difficult since you won't be embedded in the other school's social culture.

In my comment on that other post, I mentioned that I didn't want to attend MIT back then (I never even applied) because of the nerdy social culture. While I am still not the biggest fan of that culture (and other people in this thread have hinted that it's not as overbearing as one might think), in hindsight, if I had the choice between the schools, I would have rather picked MIT. I love Harvard, I love the friends I've made here, the house community, the research and career opportunities I've been afforded, but I did not realize how stuffy the social culture would be, and I also didn't appreciate the nuances of the differences in quality between SEAS at other schools and at Harvard.

Harvard vs mit (cs),The_Moorish_Guard,"In my opinion, if you are purely STEM-oriented, Harvard is nowhere near the best school that you should opt for. MIT hands-down should take the cake for this area of study. 

Harvard, like all other Ivy League schools, is HEAVILY liberal arts focused. Especially for undergraduate programs, Harvard students take a large number of humanity and social science courses throughout their years at the institution. When's the last time you've heard Harvard bragging about producing engineers and computer scientists? Exactly. 

Lots of STEM people I know don't even respect Harvard that much because they know it's an arts-oriented university with little in the way to offer for their interests. If you want to succeed in STEM, go to MIT. If you want to succeed in anything other than STEM, then Harvard is the way to go. 

Trust me, an engineering degree from MIT is far more prestigious and recognized than a gender studies degree from Harvard. Most people I've heard who got into Harvard come from grade-inflating private schools whose parents literally bought their way into a sports scholarship. MIT students are actually smarter and career-oriented, while Harvard only tends to care about bragging rights. 

If you want to become a world-class surgeon I can definitely understand the post-grad push for a Harvard program. But for undergrad? I'd steer well clear of Harvard unless your parents are millionaires and are connected like hell. Nobody cares about the school you went to when you're making the big bucks and are this close to entering an assistant CEO position at a Fortune 500 company.

This is a blazing hot take I always see on the Internet but rarely on campus. As someone who has seen all of campus and read quite a bit on the architecture on campus and the urban planning of campus (thanks O'Robert Simha), I can't help but disagree, honestly.

Maybe all of your classes were in the 35 - 38 buildings or 24/26? That's the closest that gets to this description, and 34 is being renovated pretty heavily. Not to mention the [aggressive](https://capitalprojects.mit.edu/projects/kendall-square-site-4) [East](https://capitalprojects.mit.edu/projects/kendall-square-site-5) [Cambridge](https://capitalprojects.mit.edu/projects/kendall-square-site-1) [expansion,](https://capitalprojects.mit.edu/projects/kendall-square-site-3) the Sloan Buildings, the Media Lab, MIT Nano, and the various historical buildings (main group, Walker, 70 Amherst). 

Then you have the Koch buildings, the renovated Daggett Chocolate Company buildings (E17-19), and whatever-the-hell Stata is. Another under-rated building is probably 66, with its nice art and color scheme and close approximation to the golden ratio. I've had my friends' jaws drop walking into 6C, the theoretical physics building.

I feel like a more apt description is ""varied exterior architecture with Silicon Valley Herman Miller interior design"" because that's what I'm seeing. IDK, it just kills me every time I read this re-hashed take. Like, yes, it's OK to not like MIT's campus (and I don't like Harvard's), but distilling the surprisingly rich variety of architectural thought and design into ""IBM office building from the 1970s"" is frustrating.",1,,1586890977.0,fnejad5,False,False,1586890376.0,2020-04-14 13:52:56

Harvard vs. Somewhere Else,Fake-Plastic-Stars,"I think the greatest thing about Harvard, struturally, is the freedom it affords you. You are in the driver's seat. You have the freedom to make your experience whatever you want it to be. If that means taking hard classes and pushing yourself far beyond anything you've done before, you can do that. If that means taking it relatively easy, you can do that too. It's up to you how you want to spend your time, and lots of people have classes/clubs across all their interests and really follow their curiosities. 

Harvard is a lot of things, but I don't find it to be cutthroat or competitive at all. You have a lot of hard-working, ambitious kids in one place, but everyone is going through the same real struggles, so usually people are far more collaborative and just want to learn and become the best person they can be. Don't let this make you underestimate how difficult classes can be however, they just aren't competitive in that the focus is on learning.

Socially, I think Harvard is very special. I've never met so many unique, interesting, like-minded, and generally good-hearted people. The community is wonderful and very tight knit, even though we might spend too much time on PSETs. Everytime I walk around campus I see familiar faces and it always brings a smile to my face. 

Finally, Cambridge and Boston are wonderful places to spend your college years. I really don't think New Haven is even comparable.

Harvard vs. Somewhere Else,Wrkncacnter112,"When I was in college, I dated a Yale undergrad and spent a lot of time on campus at Yale for a few years. I later went to Harvard Law School, where I had a job with a lot of Harvard undergrad colleagues. In other words, I did not attend Yale College or Harvard College, but had years of up-close experience with both communities.

The first thing I would say is that you should attend the school that’s better for what you want to study. They’re both excellent schools, and that should come first. But assuming both are roughly equal in your intended major, or you don’t know what you want to study, read on.

I am from Connecticut, but I have to admit that New Haven is not the greatest city. Cambridge is far, far better, and Boston is also great and very close to Cambridge. No comparison there. Yale feels a bit like a fortress surrounded by an unsympathetic urban landscape. Harvard is in “friendly territory”: a city with about forty colleges and universities in and around it. New Haven isn’t scary or anything. But it’s a bit gritty.

I would say that Yale focuses much more on its undergrad experience than Harvard does. Yale has really excellent facilities for undergrads at the Colleges. They’re little worlds unto themselves. Harvard Houses are also great, and some are very impressive facilities, but they’re not as self-contained. Yale Colleges are bubbles; Harvard Houses are more connected to the surrounding area. Also, Yale Colleges have very strong identity and spirit. Harvard Houses have spirit too, but not to the Yale extent. 

If you were a grad student, I’d say Harvard for sure (all else being equal). But undergrad is really what Yale prides itself on, and it does seem to be a very special experience. Yale undergrads feel like a very elite, special cohort (even if mainly to themselves), even more than Harvard ones do. Yale’s actual campus is much more architecturally beautiful and emotionally engaging (to me, anyway) than Harvard’s, but its surroundings are uglier and less fun. Yale felt like more of a pressure cooker than Harvard; the undergrads are all trying to subtly prove how awesome they are through their impressive activities and clubs, even more than at Harvard. The prevalence of Secret Societies feeds into this. Harvard has Final Clubs, but they are arguably closer to (elite) fraternities than to Secret Societies. I personally think the Secret Societies, though alluring, are mostly a bad thing. But if you want to attend mysterious ancient-seeming rites in a windowless “tomb,” Yale’s the place to do it.

Overall, Harvard is bigger, a tiny bit more relaxed, and more “normal,” in a way. Imagine a large, prestigious university in any medium-sized American city, but just older and more historic and famous, with prestige turned to 10. Yale feels more cloistered, elite, and set-apart, with its neo-gothic courtyards and Parade of Comestibles. Think Hogwarts, but in the ‘hood, with prestige also turned to 10 but everyone inside Yale believing it’s turned to 11.",21,,False,flr927h,False,False,1585415460.0,2020-03-28 12:11:00

What makes Harvard great is that you will find people from everywhere across the globe and whatever little thing you're interested in, you will - I guarantee - find a community of people who are world-class in that too. It's a fantastic intellectual community and the people there are friendly. I don't know how this meme about people being ""cutthroat"" and ""competitive"" got started, but that's just a dumb stereotype - not. true.

I visited Yale because I was admitted into their MBA program years ago and I actually made friends with the guy who showed me around campus and keep in contact with him to this day. Yale has the same vibe, but is a much smaller community.

If Harvard is baroque, Yale is rococo.

You can't go wrong with either - you'll make lifelong friends and have a great time.

The comment one person made about people in the northeast being ""colder"" …. well, there is some of that, but mainly what I've observed is that people are simply BUSY and have a lot going on.

In the Ivy League I think we have one of the more up-and-coming engineering departments, especially considering how our life sciences are so incredibly strong. We just built a hugeeeee School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex that is stunning and was set to open this year. There is the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and the Wyss Institute for Biologically-Inspired Engineering at Harvard which are both A M A Z I N G places with no other real alternatives anywhere else on the planet from a research standpoint. Plenty of undergrads I know are working in amazing labs. My freshman friend is in the process of getting into Pardis Sabeti's lab, she won TIME Person of the Year for her work on infectious diseases surrounding ebola--oh, and she teaches one of the introductory bio classes. I took a freshman seminar with--quite literally--one of the top 5 most important people in gene editing / CRISPR (David Liu). Only 10 other people were in that class, and learning from him was one of the most surreal experiences of my life.

Pre-med is competitive everywhere, but it's a spectrum. I've met a ton of really chill premeds and a ton of not-so-chill premeds. In my experience, advising has been very great: from academic advisers, to first-year proctors and major-specific advisers. But seriously though Harvard people are not cut-throat / competitive on average, stereotype is bullshit. Maybe we have less chill than other schools but I definitely don't feel pressured.

Pre-professional life here is very strong. I think you would fit right in in many of the pre-professional organizations we have on campus, which there are a ton of.

I am not sure about film organizations though almost every week there seems to be a screening of some movie pubbed around campus. 

Plenty of opportunities for art! One of our big GenEd classes is a painting seminar, that is super chill and you paint for several hours each week. There is a freshman-only art room and many of the upperclassmen dorms have similar spaces I believe. 

I write for one of the school publications. Publications on campus are absolutely f a n t a s t i c. The Crimson does incredible work. The Lampoon is weird as fuck but amazing all in its own. The Advocate is a cult and creates awesome literary works. Harvard Political Review has some amazing opinion pieces. The Harvard Independent exists. Harvard Science Review is pretty cool. There's a slew of smaller publications that are also awesome reads.

> If someone looks lost on campus, will someone typically approach them to help? Are people friendly?

as others mentioned, this is New England / East Coast, lol. People are less approachable but as an East Coaster I'm used to it and like it that way.

Often, when I'm drunk somewhere, I like to parlay the conversation into ""What are you passionate about?"" Through doing this, I've learned a lot about what other people are passionately into (much more diverse than ""I'm going into investment banking/consulting"") and I've told them what I'm passionate into, and I learn something and they learn something. This made me realize, pretty early on: I'm with the best students in the world and I know more than them about something and vice versa."" 

This made me realize the kinda-surprisingly-profound truth that at the apex of intellectualism, everything comes down to specialization. I've heard from Fulbright Scholars—they have a big pub crawl group—that they all end up making dumb dick jokes at the end of the night, because beyond ""Hey what are you studying?"" nobody can comprehend what the fuck the other specialized scholar is talking about. So they drink and make dumb sex jokes, because that's what unites all humans, you know? Ultimately, at the highest level, specialization is the reality, ""smarter"" is an oversimplification, and, statistically, students here disproportionately experience a lot of imposter syndrome. So what could unite us more than experiencing the same paranoid sense of not belonging? And if it is paranoia, and it's normal, is it really paranoia? So I basically take comfort and confidence out of the fact that I'm not only normal in this regard, I am aware, which gives me comfort and confidence.

I am high fwiw. Sorry if that was poorly written, but this is a great question and great discussion",5,,False,eazl69b,False,False,1543822577.0,2018-12-03 01:36:17

Depression and How to Not Fail Everything bc of it,Lareine,"Other commenters have given great advice regarding CAMHS and speaking to your res dean and/or academic advisor.

&#x200B;

Regarding how to talk to your professors:  I'm a professor, although not at Harvard.  The vast, vast majority of professors are absolutely understanding of mental health difficulties.  There are all kinds of ways they can support you, from extensions to alternate assignments to postponing exams.  I promise you, 98% of professors wish their students would communicate \*more\* about mental health status.  We are rooting for every single student, and it is so heartbreaking when a student drops of the radar, and we can't help, because they don't talk to us.  


How exactly to do it?  A short email.  

>Hi Professor So-and-so,    
>  
>I am a student in your Whatever Class, and I'm writing to seek some extra help.  Unfortunately, I am dealing with some mental health issues lately \[feel free to be more specific if you are comfortable!\], and I have been finding it hard to keep up.  This class is very important to me, and I really want to stay involved.  Would you be willing to consider allowing me to \[complete late assignment X\]/\[have an extension on Y\]/\[take Exam Z at another time\]/\[meet with me privately\], to help me re-engage with the class?    
>  
>Many thanks,   
>  
>americandragonfruit

There is no scenario where I get an email like that and don't immediately start brainstorming ways to make it work.

&#x200B;

For the 2% of profs who are assholes:  This is another reason why communicating regularly with your res dean, advisor, and tutors (once you are Housed) is super important.  They will document that you are truly in need, and they will advocate for you with professors.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps, and good luck.  Remember, you are absolutely at Harvard for a reason, and everyone defines success differently.  Grades aren't everything, following a traditional 4-year graduation path is not required, and your health is far more important than your accolades.

"Thinking back to your freshman year: what advice do you wish you could give yourself? What'd you do right, and wrong, and how can I be happy at Harvard?",MiaHavero,"I went a long time ago, but hopefully what I learned is still valid:

* Take advantage of shopping period. (They still have that, right?) I took a freshman seminar that sounded cool but turned out to be a total waste of time. I wish I had tried out another course or two the first week, chosen to stay in a better one, and dropped the dud. You're at a place with a huge range of courses and some of the most amazing professors in the world. Don't waste it on a class you're getting nothing out of.
* Talk to professors. For much of my time at Harvard, I thought you only went to see professors when you were having trouble with the work. What an idiot. It turns out that most of them actually care about their specialty, and would love to talk to students who want to know more about it. Some of them are Nobel Prize winners or other amazing people -- how often do you get a chance to talk to people like that? (If you're wondering what you'd say, one possibility is to go discuss ideas you have for an upcoming paper or project in the course.)
* Find at least one activity you're interested in that lets anyone participate. I made the mistake of comping for some things that I didn't realize were hard to get into, and ended up not accepted in any, and discouraged. ",9,,1534374305.0,e49emk7,False,False,1534374062.0,2018-08-15 18:01:02

I wanted to thank you for this really awesome and thoughtful response. I wrote this question in a rush and on a whim, because I've been stressing a bit about making the most of college and finally unlocking my 'best self' when I get there. I've done well, but I haven't felt that well for most of my life. So hearing these suggestions on wellness is really great. 

I plan on studying the Life Sciences (probably neuroscience w/ a comp sci secondary) but I'm also such a glut for the NYTimes and snazzy essay-type writing, so I'm really hyped to try and comp for the Crimson (thanks for kind of affirming trying that out, I was on their comp website earlier today!). I partied a bit in high school, went way overboard one night and felt embarrassed and miserable, so I hope I learned my lesson there. And I actually got ankle surgery this summer so I'm arriving at Harvard in a boot. Soon as I'm out of that - joining the friendliest seeming sport ASAP to keep depression at bay. Right now I'm thinking Boxing or Jiu Jitsu.

So yeah. Just thanks a ton. I'm gonna try and a)join a club sport, b) get out of the Harvard bubble, and c) try to not get sucked into the stress culture you spoke of - had enough of that in high school, and I'm stressed enough as is.

I tried to give food to homeless guy in the square and he turned me down...,Dodge-em,"I was homeless in Cambridge. Had you offered me a basic Clif Bar (oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip), I would've gratefully accepted it in a heartbeat. I'm a ""crunchy kid"" (as a Kevin from Rhode Island once dubbed me), so, I lived on something like that. 

I also have my own variety of allergies/intolerances, so if you had offered me a bag of bar b' cue chips, protein-enriched Clif bars, or something with MSG (not connected to gluten), I would've had to politely turn you down.

Thing is, I never once panhandled. I ate every dollar of the very necessary food stamps I was issued by the state (and on rare occasion, I'd treat one dude who used to hang out in the cafe area of the Star Market that was at Sidney and Green streets to a dessert and a frappasomedoodle-thingy from Starbucks-and he was incredibly grateful each time.)....and this was part due to the fact that some of the community meal spots sometimes made foods I couldn't eat.

Thing is, some of the guys panhandling are too busy panhandling instead of hustling about (as I did) from one social service area or meal spot or another just to stay afloat with things like laundry, storage, showering, getting mail/messages, making phonecalls, finding new clothes, getting meals, going to food pantries, getting legal aid, getting health care, making appointments for assistance, sustaining shelter, etc....than again, with the way the virus is ravaging, are most of these things open anymore?

There was an old dude who used to hang out in front of the Food Co-Op with a sign and act real rude. I'd give him a Quacker bar, and he tossed it the minute my back was turned. On two different occasions, I saw a red convertible show up to pick him up, and he'd just toss his sign and drive off. It's like he was fulfilling some obligation to turn public sentiment against the homeless (wouldn't be the first time I've seen things like that).

What you did was right. Yet, as one person suggested, next time they are ""under extenuating circumstances"", offer to go in and shop some items directly for them. Never give them money. 

Also, never give homemade food unless you are working under the umbrella of a greater ""established"" organization (be it church or something like Food-Not-Bombs) and within the guidelines they operate by.

Point is: I've seen it as a homeless person. I've also been as one who provides assistance to people on the streets (I even volunteered with places that served meals though I was staying at a shelter).

There are a broader range of interdisciplinary life sciences concentrations at Harvard that focus on different areas (or at least there used to be). There's very little organismic/evolutionary biology at MIT.

Favorite Restaurants near Harvard?,xiipaoc,"Dumpling House.  Best food around.  And I'm including Five Spices; Dumpling House is better.  It's also better than Shanghai Fresh (that restaurant always disappoints me; I think it's going to be so good, but then... it's good, just not as good as I expect).  Better than Mulan.  Haven't been to Mary Chung's in forever, though.  Also, better than Flame and Cilantro.  No comparison with the Kong.  Holy shit there's a lot of good Chinese food in the Central Square area.

If you want something a bit nicer but not crazy expensive, there's Waypoint.  It's a pretty trendy-ish seafood place, but the food is actually really good.  Speaking of seafood, my wife really likes the Hourly for oysters.

Asmara is really good Eritrean food.  There used to be another Ethiopian/Eritrean restaurant nearby, towards Porter, but now Asmara is the only thing around.  I *love* that injera.  (Also they serve raw beef!  Yum!)  You can actually just buy homemade injera at Shalimar ($5 last I checked, not recently), but they make you pay for the injera with cash because they sell it on behalf of the person who makes it.  No preservatives, so the injera sours pretty quickly.  That's why it's so fucking good.

Monkfish (formerly Thelonious Monkfish) is pretty good.  I like it.  Wife doesn't.  The sushi is overpriced, but the duck curry with lychee is awesome.

For Japanese, this is a bit far, but go to Wafu-Ya in Porter Square.  I think it's less than 20 minutes from the Science Center.  They have great specials and a great menu.  Though last I checked they were closed for ""renovations""... again.  Maybe I'll walk over there this weekend and take a peek, because I can't get those specials to go at Cafe Sushi.  Speaking of which, Cafe Sushi has *really* good specials, but you're going to need a reservation and a fuckton of cash because it's also expensive.  I did their omakase once, I think it was $85?  It's definitely not an everyday meal, but for once in a while, if you can afford it, it's worth it.  Note that if you want stuff to go, you can't order their good stuff.

That's all I can think of within a 20-minute walk of Harvard.  If you want to go 30 minutes, there's stuff in Union Square that's pretty good, like Macchu Picchu (get their alfajores, holy shit) and some, like, trendy places that I wouldn't know.  There's also a good restaurant scene in the South End, which is annoying to get to (you can take the 1, but it's more than 20 minutes, I think).

We still need affirmative action — just not by race - Kahlenberg H'85 HLS'89,labormarket,"Quoted due to paywall:

&#x200B;

>A recent [WGBH](https://www.wgbh.org/news/education/2018/09/16/poll-72-percent-of-americans-oppose-considering-race-in-college-admissions-but-even-more-value-racial-diversity) poll found that 86 percent of Americans value having racial and ethnic diversity on college campuses, and yet 72 percent said they disagreed with a Supreme Court decision allowing race to be “one factor in deciding which applicants to admit.” Are Americans nuts in thinking universities can get racial diversity without racial preferences?  
>  
>Not at all. Because race still matters in American society, blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately poor, and therefore disproportionately benefit from socioeconomic preferences. At the same time, the class-based approach recognizes that disadvantaged whites and Asians deserve a leg up, too, and that privileged underrepresented minorities, such as former President Barack Obama’s daughters, do not.   
>  
>  
>  
>Needs-based affirmative action makes sense to people. Whereas only 24 percent supported using race as a factor in the WGBH poll, 58 percent said admissions officers should include “overcoming hardships such as poverty or health problems” as an admissions factor — more than supported considering leadership, or athletic or musical talent.  
>  
>  
>  
>Extensive [research](https://tcf.org/content/report/future-of-affirmative-action/) finds that if colleges create a genuinely fair admissions system, which factors in economic obstacles students have had to overcome, then African-Americans and Latinos can succeed without racial preferences. New [research](http://samv91khoyt2i553a2t1s05i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Doc-416-1-Kahlenberg-Expert-Report.pdf) my colleagues and I conducted as part of a lawsuit by Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard affirms these findings.   
>  
>Using actual applicant data, we were able to test whether socioeconomic preferences would work to produce the educational benefits of diversity, using Harvard’s own system of rating students based on academic, extracurricular, athletic, and personal criteria.  
>  
>  
>  
>We began by simulating what would happen if Harvard eliminated the blatantly unfair obstacles that it throws in the path of disadvantaged students, such as the substantial preference provided to the privileged children of alumni and faculty children, and a back-door “Z-list” admissions system that favors, among others, those who make it on to a special “dean’s interest” list. We then provided a preference to economically disadvantaged students that is about half the size of the leg up Harvard currently gives to athletes. Students of different races were treated equally.  
>  
>The result? The admission of African American and Latino and other underrepresented minority students rose from 28 percent to 30 percent. Meanwhile, the proportion of first-generation college students increased from 7 percent to 25 percent, a development that would surely make classrooms discussion more interesting at a university where in recent years, the number of high-income students has [outnumbered](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/papers/coll_mrc_paper.pdf) the number of low-income students by 23 to 1.  
>  
>Harvard nevertheless [claimed](http://samv91khoyt2i553a2t1s05i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Doc-416-3-Kahlenberg-Errata.pdf) this alternative system would fail to maintain “the standards of excellence that Harvard seeks in its student body.”   
>  
>  
>  
>In reality, however, under socioeconomic preferences, the average high school grades of admitted students would be just as high as they are now, and SAT scores would be at the 98th percentile.   
>  
>Incredibly, officials at Harvard also raised questions about whether the nation’s richest university could afford to provide financial aid under a system socioeconomic preferences. This was a surprising claim from an institution whose $37 billion endowment is larger than the GDP of half of the world’s countries. Indeed, Harvard’s own financial aid director testified that Harvard would have no problem doubling the proportion of disadvantaged students eligible for financial aid programs.  
>  
>Racial diversity on campus is important, especially in the age of Donald Trump, when our nation is so deeply divided. But there is a better, less divisive way to achieve the goal by opening the doors of elite universities to disadvantaged students of all races who are now largely shut out of elite higher education.

The problem with it is (1) Harvard likes wealthy families, especially potential donors. It's hard to stay elite with a class filed with economically poor geniuses without family or business connections (2) Harvard cares more about looking diverse than being diverse. (i.e., Having a bunch of poor asian immigrants who worked at their family's small laundromat or restaurant after school isn't going to cull liberal racism about personality-less un-creative asian ""drones"")

Self-administered tests & self-quarantines,Oregon_4000,">Is it possible Harvard's decision to go ""self-administered"" with Covid testing is a way to give plausible deniability to the campus?

No. The self-test kits are in everyone's interests. The self-test kits help the already busy students save time. It is also safer to not have clusters of students going to the same place to get tested, rather they can administer the test in their own room. Moreover, having self-administered tests opens up Harvard to more liability, not less.

>There will be a percentage of students that send back blank samples or don't follow the instructions well.

There will be ""a percentage,"" but there is no reason to believe that this percentage of students is higher than the percentage for missing test days or having inconclusive samples in a system without self testing. Actually, since it is easier for students to complete the self test there is reason to believe that the percentage of bad/missed samples will be lower with self testing. Also, students are promptly notified of bad/missed samples.

>Harvard will drop off a 7-day supply kit to positive cases in the dorms, *and they recommend self-quarantine (unenforced honor system)*.

The latter part is of this statement is untrue. Self-quarantine is not only recommended—enforcement is done by all Officers of the University, Securitas Security, and the Harvard University Police Department.",16,,False,g4aco53,False,False,1599440815.0,2020-09-06 20:06:55

I would say that people at Harvard are generally somewhat stressed, but that the stress is self-induced more than externally-induced.

Struggling Student,wakeupmrwes1,"The competition can be fierce while you're there, especially as a freshman adjusting to college life. You will likely have to change your study habits from high school, depending on your coursework and extracurricular balance.

It may be useful to reach out to one of your house tutors, concentration advisor, or an upperclassman/PAF. Especially for the upperclassmen and PAFs, they will give you real advice from their own (possibly similar experience).

As for grades, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Unless you're gunning for a top consulting position or a top 10 med/law school, your grades don't matter as much as graduating from Harvard. The name itself will carry a lot of weight post-grad. And things get easier post-grad, as you'll notice how rigorous your classwork and peer competition was compared to others. It can be difficult now, but definitely make sure to keep the big picture in mind and that exams and p-sets are only a small part of the Harvard experience (and thus the benefits that the school can provide for you).

Struggling Student,whatjanet,"Hi student, I felt exactly the same way my freshman year. I felt like everyone around me knew what to say, how to ask questions, how to form relationships with professors, and how to study effectively. Harvard has a culture that many students coming from Andover and Choate (#noteanoshade) are already familiar with. I came from a public school and did not learn these skills. 

As for studying (I was STEM and can’t say much about humanities), I would study a lot by myself, but later realized I can cover a lot more studying as a group. I tried videos, notes, anki... the important skills are active recall and spaced repetition, but also using your peers as a way to make sure you’re covering your bases. 

Set goals, meet nice people to work with. It’s better to struggle with friends than struggle alone. Every Thursday was an all-nighter with my friend as we furiously tried to finish the pset.

What made me feel more confident was to tell myself that I deserved a seat at the table. I deserved to be comfortable around professors and freely ask questions or just say “I really don’t understand this.” Freshman year is hard! Be honest, take this year to make your mistakes. Good luck.",7,,False,f33y769,False,False,1570647701.0,2019-10-09 14:01:41
Struggling Student,rough-hewn,"Reposting some hopefully useful comments I gave to an earlier post about someone who was struggling after their first semester:

My first semester grades of freshman year (waaaaay back in 1999) were, my worst of all of college. I kept them pretty steadily climbing every semester after to where I had mostly As with one or two A- grades late junior and senior years. I got my overall GPA up to a pretty respectable level and have had great opportunities since college.

Here's what I learned that most helped me:

1. Let go of all but one or two extracurriculars that demand major time/effort commitments (more than, say, an hour per week). You can stay on email lists and keep up with the interesting parts of the others, but don't let yourself commit to stuff. You mentioned an initial goal to try all possible opportunities at Harvard. In just four years a hundred people together couldn't take advantage of ALL Harvard has to offer; trying will just run you ragged. Now that you've had some time to explore probably just a small sampling of those opportunities, pick a few and focus on the quality of that experience for yourself and others. How do you pick which ones to keep? I suggest choosing ones where you a) really enjoy the activities, b) care about their purpose, and c) enjoy spending time with the people. For most of my friends years after graduation the most meaningful part of the extracurriculars is the friendships they developed. Which groups do you want to nourish your friendships with most? If you've taken all those factors seriously and STILL have too many to choose from, then consider which will best help you develop skills for careers that interest you.
2. In terms of both classes and activities taken, try to balance your workload and pace yourself. Two tough classes this semester? Try to balance it out with some less challenging ones or scale back a bit on extracurriculars for a semester. You seem to have already diagnosed this issue so not too much to add here. Just realize that if you've built a system that requires delicate balance, that also requires minimal disruption from outside forces. Midterms, romantic relationships, family situations, roommate drama, illness, all kinds of other things can be big disruptive forces. If you don't have a bit of ""slack"" to handle those unexpected increases in stress it's easy to get into a downward spiral.
3. Take advantage of office hours. This totally deserves its own point; I wish I had picked up on this my freshman year. Your professors and TFs want you to succeed. They can often tell who's struggling but can't really come running to all of you. The easiest way for them to help is if you come to their office hours and get some help on part of a problem set that you're stuck on or when you're struggling with a topic on a paper. Even if they seem standoffish in lectures they're often very personable and helpful one-on-one. Go early, well before the deadlines, before you're panicking, before you've wasted a bunch of energy banging your head against the desk. Don't ask for answers or special favors but do make it clear you want to understand the material and do well in the class. They can clear roadblocks, steer you in useful directions (e.g. ""that's not a very interesting paper topic but have you thought about this other angle on your idea?""), better signal what they care about in grading, and prevent SO much wasted effort in your work. Two other advantages: they'll better understand what some students (at least you) are struggling with and may be able to adjust their lectures to be more helpful for you. You'll also often build good relationships with them that yield other cool opportunities. In my junior year I regularly visited the professor's office hours for my Thermodynamics class. I was not at the top of the class but at the end he asked me whether I'd like to be a TF the following year, which turned out to be a really awesome opportunity.
4. Join or create study groups. Again this prevents you wasting time banging your head against the desk when someone else in the group can quickly help you see something you were missing. It also reduces your feeling that you're alone in finding things difficult and will hopefully give you a chance to help others. Helping others with their challenges often helped me learn the material better myself. In my time Prof. Morin had a Thursday night study session in the Leverett dining hall for his Physics class. He and one of his TAs would just be on hand for any questions. Lots of other science and math Profs did the same. About half the class showed up to work on problem sets together those evenings. Whenever a bunch of us were stumped one of us went to the Prof or TA for help to unblock us. Working in those groups helped me a ton and I made some good friends at the same time.
5. Get help early. Meet with your proctor or freshman dean or whatever they have these days and tell them you had a tough semester and want to know what kinds of help is available going forward before you get into a panicked or bad situation. They will gladly open a ton of doors to people willing and eager to help you.",2,,False,f34suuj,False,False,1570659884.0,2019-10-09 17:24:44

I understand some of the author [Nathan J Robinson's](https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/nathan-robinson) points, but much of the piece felt like it was digging for talking points to be critical.  For example, Buttigieg has had privilege and many opportunities in life due to his upbringing that few people have.  At least he seems to have taken a better path than many people with similar opportunities take.  I'd say McKinsey is the least ""noble"" part of the path, but I can't automatically discount someone because of that.  I'm sure we all know decent people who have worked at these consulting firms.  I was also put off by what I perceived to a style in the piece of being critical because Buttigieg did not express outrage about by X, Y, Z inequality.

My Sad Freshman Experience,rough-hewn,"This happened to me in my first year at Harvard (1999) and I'm sure it happens to lots of others too. You're not alone in this experience. My first semester grades of freshman year were, I think, my worst of all of college. I kept them pretty steadily climbing every semester after to where I had mostly As with one or two A- grades late junior and senior years. I got my overall GPA up to a pretty respectable level and have had great opportunities since college. Things can get better for you too. Here's what I learned that most helped me:

1. I agree with shoogenboogen's suggestion to let go of all but one or two extracurriculars that demand major time/effort commitments (more than, say, an hour per week). You can stay on email lists and keep up with the interesting parts of the others, but don't let yourself commit to stuff. You mentioned an initial goal to try all possible opportunities at Harvard. In just four years a hundred people together couldn't take advantage of ALL Harvard has to offer; trying will just run you ragged. Now that you've had some time to explore probably just a small sampling of those opportunities, pick a few and focus on the quality of that experience for yourself and others. How do you pick which ones to keep? I suggest choosing ones where you a) really enjoy the activities, b) care about their purpose, and c) enjoy spending time with the people. For most of my friends years after graduation the most meaningful part of the extracurriculars is the friendships they developed. Which groups do you want to nourish your friendships with most? If you've taken all those factors seriously and STILL have too many to choose from, then consider which will best help you develop skills for careers that interest you.

2. In terms of both classes and activities taken, try to balance your workload and pace yourself. Two tough classes this semester? Try to balance it out with some less challenging ones or scale back a bit on extracurriculars for a semester. You seem to have already diagnosed this issue so not too much to add here. Just realize that if you've built a system that requires delicate balance, that also requires minimal disruption from outside forces. Midterms, romantic relationships, family situations, roommate drama, illness, all kinds of other things can be big disruptive forces. If you don't have a bit of ""slack"" to handle those unexpected increases in stress it's easy to get into a downward spiral.

3. Take advantage of office hours. This totally deserves its own point; I wish I had picked up on this my freshman year. Your professors and TFs want you to succeed. They can often tell who's struggling but can't really come running to all of you. The easiest way for them to help is if you come to their office hours and get some help on part of a problem set that you're stuck on or when you're struggling with a topic on a paper. Even if they seem standoffish in lectures they're often very personable and helpful one-on-one. Go early, well before the deadlines, before you're panicking, before you've wasted a bunch of energy banging your head against the desk. Don't ask for answers or special favors but do make it clear you want to understand the material and do well in the class. They can clear roadblocks, steer you in useful directions (e.g. ""that's not a very interesting paper topic but have you thought about this other angle on your idea?""), better signal what they care about in grading, and prevent SO much wasted effort in your work. Two other advantages: they'll better understand what some students (at least you) are struggling with and may be able to adjust their lectures to be more helpful for you. You'll also often build good relationships with them that yield other cool opportunities. In my junior year I regularly visited the professor's office hours for my Thermodynamics class. I was not at the top of the class but at the end he asked me whether I'd like to be a TF the following year, which turned out to be a really awesome opportunity.

4. Join or create study groups. Again this prevents you wasting time banging your head against the desk when someone else in the group can quickly help you see something you were missing. It also reduces your feeling that you're alone in finding things difficult and will hopefully give you a chance to help others. Helping others with their challenges often helped me learn the material better myself. In my time Prof. Morin had a Thursday night study session in the Leverett dining hall for his Physics class. He and one of his TAs would just be on hand for any questions. Lots of other science and math Profs did the same. About half the class showed up to work on problem sets together those evenings. Whenever a bunch of us were stumped one of us went to the Prof or TA for help to unblock us. Working in those groups helped me a ton and I made some good friends at the same time.

5. Get help early. Meet with your proctor or freshman dean or whatever they have these days and tell them you had a tough semester and want to know what kinds of help is available going forward before you get into a panicked or bad situation. They will gladly open a ton of doors to people willing and eager to help you.

Academia? What do you like? What makes you feel energetic? 

Also, you're what? 19-20? Relax a tiny bit. A lot of successful people only realize what they ""should"" be doing in their mid-20s-30s.

You have also only taken 8-10ish courses so far. It's not like you've explored everything. If you don't know what you like, what do you know you don't like?",24,,False,g54g44h,False,False,1600011899.0,2020-09-13 10:44:59
Career Path,the_protagonist,"I used to be the pre-careers tutor in one of the houses - a huge number of students feel this way. And I did too, as a student, which is specifically why I went back and became a tutor. What’s happening is not that your options are narrowing, it’s that those fields you mention (plus academia, law school, and maybe teaching) attract the most Harvard students due to a combination of prestige, compensation, interestingness, ability to keep your options open for later career changes, and simply the amount of money those companies can afford to spend on showing up to Harvard recruiting events. Some of those reasons are valid and some totally suck. But the real world of options is very broad!  

So here’s what you should do as a sophomore and beyond.  A 3-pronged strategy, all related:

1. Test career hypotheses. Think about what fits in the center of the Venn diagram between what you like and what you’re good at, and keep pursing it and gaining expertise and trying it out. Could be lots of different things. Form a hypothesis based on your interests and skills, like “maybe I would like doing x because I enjoy team environments and engineering puzzles,” and figure out ways to test it experimentally: through a project, a class, an internship, even an informational interview with an alumnus (try emailing them with a really short “can we have a call” email, you’ll get a really high response rate compared to cold emails out in the world!) or shadowing them for a day. Etc. Different experiments have different levels of fidelity and that’s OK. As long as you’re learning, you’re making progress!

2. Proactively learn more about what’s out there, to counteract the “OCS Effect” you’re currently experiencing. This can happen naturally through #1 but it’s also good to do things like: look through the alumni database in no particular order, to get a sense of what alumni’s actual distribution of jobs are. Read the OCS data on that and look through the diverse long tail of career paths that aren’t the Big 5 or whatever, and dig in on what some of them are. Get an alumnus to lend you their 5- or 10-year Reunion Red Book with classmates’ updates to each other on what their life has been like since graduation. 

3. Actively open yourself up to serendipity. This sounds goofy but in reality a large fraction of job offers come through luck rather than the standard codified processes. Create that luck by: going up to talk to your professor after class when there’s something that piques your interest. Signing up for the clubs and email lists for both Harvard and MIT or other local schools on subjects you’re interested in, and when an event catches your eye, show up, and engage with the speaker afterwards in person. (Post-COVID of course). Submit to the mind-numbing haystack that is career fairs - just go, and read through the lists of companies, because you only need one to catch your eye and work out, even if it means going through hundreds. Get out of your room, and say yes to things and see where they take you.

Really? I've heard that tenure review boards at Harvard put very low weight on everything teaching-related. I've heard a number of faculty complain that they put tons of effort into pedagogy and get zero points for it among their colleagues, and that this is why Harvard (at least the College) has a reputation for distant professors.

Totally agree that student evals should not be overused in performance review, though. What little research has been done on them there is shows that there's very poor or even negative correlation between a teacher's eval scores and their ability to prepare students to succeed in subsequent related courses, but there's a big penalty for female and minority faculty that doesn't correlate with actual performance.",1,,False,fblov1i,False,False,1576966484.0,2019-12-21 16:14:44
Grade inflation or deflation?,slightlychaoticevil,"First, you're right that it's about money, but not the way you think you are. Doing basic research outside of academia is almost impossible, since companies want to find research that will result in a product. It is definitely more profitable if you do applied research to go find some well funded company to give you a lab. But for everyone else, academia is really the only place for us. Which sucks.

Secondly, it's not all about the money. Honestly, I love teaching but academic research doesn't seem to be how I want to spend my life. Knowing that I will most likely leave academia one day, I already miss it. The community, the discussions, the collaborations. If I could find a way to stay in academia, teach, and not have to apply for grants, I'd take it in a heartbeat. 

Lastly, teaching is a skill. Whenever you start something new, even with training, you suck. But some academics don't get training to teach at all - they get training to do research. Think about that for a second. Trying to do a job you weren't trained for, knowing you'll get dragged across the coals. It's daunting and hellish. Harvard is fantastic and we have the Bok, but even still, it's a long learning curve to being a good teacher. Don't judge someone too harshly for being youngish and being a bad teacher. Emeritus old? Go for it. They just don't care at this point, either about teaching or caring to improve themselves. But for everyone else? Help them improve, rather than hating them for being bad, because honest and thoughtful feedback from students (rare, but not imaginary) is one of the few things that makes the learning curve easier.",2,,False,fbn3722,False,False,1576992125.0,2019-12-21 23:22:05

How easy is it to jump into an entirely new field at Harvard?,crimsonchin68,"Came into Harvard thinking I was going to be an engineer but quickly realized it wasn’t going to be for me and I moved into Econ, which was completely new to me in terms of my high school course load. My experience was that Econ was very doable regarding of the difficulty and course load of all my classes, but my friends who took CS definitely had a ton of difficult work. With that being said, it was also my impression that if you get into Harvard you are almost certainly capable of studying anything you really want to try.

How easy is it to jump into an entirely new field at Harvard?,crharvard,"This is a really good question. I say, like in all situations, it depends on your background and what you're trying to break into. Generally, I think that it is easier, logistically, to explore new things at Harvard than at most other schools. Most concentrations don't have too many requirements, so you have lots of room in your schedule to take electives in new fields and explore a lot during freshman and sophomore year. Additionally, so many people end up switching concentrations, and this tends to be easy at Harvard because as long as you can show that you have the prereqs, time, and room to satisfy a concentration's requirements, you can switch (whereas many other places will make you formally transfer departments in a selective application process). Hell, I know someone who switched their concentration senior fall. 

However, I still think exploration and switching around is, in many ways, actually more difficult at Harvard. Some fields more than others, particularly Math and CS, benefit very much from early exposure and practice no matter where you go. When you combine this with the fact that at Harvard, you're likely to find those who were some of the *best in the world* at those fields in high school, it can feel demoralizing when you first begin your journey. Then additionally combine this with the fact that courses at Harvard tend to be more rigorous than those at lower ranked schools. This can make things pretty difficult. For example, I was super into physics in high school, but when I came here, I started to grow interest in Electrical Eng and CS. I felt soooo stupid all the time in those classes (I already felt dumb enough in physics anyway). I don't think I was actually dumber than the average EE or CS student, I just had less experience and was taking classes that were already difficult on their own with people who lived and breathed this stuff in high school and during their whole time in college.

This definitely tends to more pronounced in hard STEM fields, really. I think it's a lot easier to explore interests in the social sciences or humanities with a STEM background than vice versa. It's not uncommon to find someone who later gets dissuaded from hard STEM and claim they took ""the easy way out"" by switching to Econ or Gov. Of course I am not at all saying those are necessarily easy fields but that there are many more easy ways to do Econ or Gov versus ""easy"" ways to do CS or Physics or Math etc (but there are still super hard ways to study Econ).

Conversely, you'll be hard pressed to find someone who, after mostly studying a social science or humanities field, ends up getting a Math degree or related. It's not that they weren't capable of studying Math, but Math more so than I think every other field really benefits from early exposure (most Math concentrators start with Math 25, and if you're not at that level freshman year, it can be hard to get there later on). And personally, when I think about how much I've struggled with my physics degree at Harvard, even after winning awards and doing research starting in high school, I can't even imagine what it must be like to experience physics for the first time at Harvard. More than just pure content, the style of thinking necessary in STEM fields and your mathematical maturity is something that you slowly develop over time.

This does suck, but I think it's good to understand early on that the barriers surrounding certain fields of study are higher than others. Knowing this, you're better able to manage expectations of your performance when you will inevitably encounter challenges and come across people whose abilities blow your mind. And as a prefrosh, you are at the position where it is easiest to jump around and explore other fields of interest, but this gets much harder to do with each year that passes by in college. I still ended up getting a CS secondary, and funny enough I feel even though CS is one of those aforementioned fields, so many people at Harvard end up switching to it anyway. If you think you want to explore CS and Econ at Harvard but you don't have experience in them, it doesn't hurt to dabble in that right now and do some early prep. For CS and more quantitative Econ, it's really important to improve your mathematical skills, so work on that, too. 

EDIT: Just to add more personal examples to my already excessively long comment: Throughout my years, I've taken super interesting upper level electives in History, Econ, Gov, and English and didn't feel like my academic background held me back (i.e. I did not need to complete whatever standard intro sequence exists for those concentrations). But I can't imagine a history concentrator jumping into, say, upper level electrodynamics, without having the years of physics background.",5,,1590039683.0,frapdev,False,False,1590023640.0,2020-05-20 20:14:00

How realistic is this courseload for next semester?,UniformlyConvergent,"I would advise against self-studying STAT110 since it is an extremely fundamental class and Joe does an amazing job of teaching it. You will definitely learn a lot of stuff taking the class in person that you would have otherwise missed by self studying. Also, if you decide to take another class such as Stat 111 (which was taught by Joe this year as well) which are basics an extension of 110, you will suffer a lot as it makes a lot references to stories and proofs in 110. Also, Stat 110 is definitely more useful to interviews than 124, so take it seriously. Coming to 124, most crypto or algorithms classes teach you the required number theory on the fly, so don’t worry about it. You will not be asked more number theory than covered in CS 124 (which is one weeks material) anyways. If you want rigorous intro to math, please consider something like Math 112 (this is unlike 23 real analysis which is fake), 113 (if you think your analysis from 23 is good enough), 121 (if you want a chiller but more useful class), 130 etc. 

Also, most classes are pretty useless in the real world aside the ones that teach you the fundamentals (math 25ab, stat 110, CS 124, 61, 161, 181) and the part of the material that is useful you can probably pick on fly, so imo you can invest your time more smartly into research or a project. You will learn so much in the process and also discover the material which is actually useful for your work that you can study in school later. My freshman year, I was tempted to take a bunch of classes like you mostly because my surroundings were all math 55 kids, but then I realized that is not what matters the most unless you want to become a theoretical scientist.

I'll offer some additional information in regards to auditing.  This information is accurate as of the last time I audited a course, but it will need to be validated for anyone wanting to just drop in on a class.  I suspect that the zero-cost nature of auditing has likely changed.  I was a student who had taken courses for credit previously.

Auditing a course for no credit is possible at HES, but the requirements are that you register as a non-credit student for the course so that an ID can be granted and proper arrangements can be made for seating,  There was no cost to me at the time.  Courses so audited will not be graded and no work will be required of the student, but the fact that you audited will show up on an official transcript.

Not to self-pub, but I think the rest of [this column](https://www.thecrimson.com/column/after-the-fact/article/2018/11/19/levin-asking-the-right-questions/) is pretty solid first-year advice, too—I wrote it with your question in mind.

Other miscellany: go abroad, go abroad, go abroad. Do things you know you'd kick yourself if you didn't do, even if it means risking failing. As many have said, take easy classes your first semester. Don't get super drunk more than a couple times a semester. Actually reach out to people you want to befriend (offering specific mealtimes and locations is a good idea). Don't stress too much about post-graduation stuff. Do the corny stuff like entryway study breaks and HoCo and generally try to meet the people Harvard pseudo-randomly puts you in proximity of.

But I can tell you this.

(1) Stanford has a very friendly campus. It is not at all like Harvard.
(2) Berkeley has a very, VERY diverse campus. With lots of Asians. Asians are, in general, considered ""outsiders"" in America. They are not likely to be labelling virtually everyone non-white as ""having large families"", ""not being able to read"", et cetera.
(3) Another thing is that Harvard is in the Boston area. Boston is far more white than the Bay Area.
(4) Much better to compare Harvard to Big Ten Universities. Those campuses are just *much* more chilled out. Harvard is snooty. Harvard is full of rich kids. Who act like assholes whenever they can. That is Harvard for you.

My theory at the moment is that HES intentionally doesn't publicize its admission figures because a lot less people might try to gain admission if they knew how hard it was to do, and given that one must pay several thousand dollars to them before they can even submit an application, the school could stand to lose a lot of money if very low admit/pass rates were made public.",4,,False,g3sf0nb,False,False,1599091956.0,2020-09-02 19:12:36

"Econ undergrad students, what’s your favorite class/professor?",everwriter,"Ec concentrator here, DM if you’d like more info. 

*Ec50* was a fantastic course. The course is about solving societal problems (e.g. systematic income inequality, education reform) using economics and big data. It’s taught as an intro course in large lecture format, so even with no economics experience, you’ll have a rewarding time. It’s taught by Raj Chetty, the smartest Harvard professor I’ve ever met. The content is super interesting and the course is structured super well, plus Raj is an incredible lecturer and seems to know the answer to everything.

*Ec10a* is, of course, the intro Ec course at Harvard. It’s a solid intro to microeconomics and really good if you’ve had little economics experience since they try to walk you through the concepts. Make sure that you find a TF that you like for *Ec10a*, and you’ll be fine. I enjoyed this course since it got me really excited about basic microeconomics.

From personal experience, I don’t recommend *Ec10b*, the *Ec1010* series, the *Ec1011* series, or *Ec1123*. They start to become less exciting imo and more technical. *Ec10b* might be good if you’re particularly interested in macroeconomics but otherwise wasn’t particularly engaging.

Your mileage with *Ec970* will really depend on who your preceptor is. Since all classes follow the same assignment structure, your choice of instructor will heavily impact how your assignments are graded and how well your course is taught. I strongly recommend thoroughly reading the Q guide if you’re interested in these courses. Also, note that it’s best to have the *Ec10 series* under your belt for these courses; taking *Ec1123/1126* will also be hugely helpful with STATA.",11,,False,ft2lfng,False,False,1591426393.0,2020-06-06 01:53:13
"Econ undergrad students, what’s your favorite class/professor?",bayesleaf,"commenting bc i think i have the opposite experience of that other guy — i think which ones you like will largely depend on how much you like math. imo there is somewhat large divide in the ec department between the math-heavy econ courses where you model things, etc vs the more conceptual ones. this begins largely with 1010 vs 1011 (with 1011 being more math focused) and continues thereafter.

depending on your post-grad aspirations and joy for mathematical thinking, you’ll probably gravitate toward one of these sets of classes and enjoy one more than the other. because of this, i’ve probably enjoyed 1011a the most out of any econ class (seriously, glaeser is incredible) and other electives that require it.

But if you’re curious now you can look up the concentrations online and get an idea of what they require. For example physics is like 12-16 required classes out of the 32 you’ll take. So if you were doing that you’d balance 1 or 2 of those quantitative classes per semester with lighter ones, and the early basics courses would count for multiple possible concentrations usually so you’re able to switch. 

So exploring in year 1 is the main focus, and including a healthy dose of courses that are intro requirements for hypothetical majors doesn’t hurt to help you get a head start.

While it's true that Yale has no final clubs, it has something even more exclusive: secret societies.

Recent admit questions!,randomnese,"1. Stress culture is pretty bad but that's pretty much universal across most top schools these days. Competition isn't all that intense since there's such a large variety of opportunities. Make good friends outside of your concentration and great friends that align with your interests.
2. There's elitism. Same advice as above: make good friends and you'll never have to really deal with it.
3. Parties are in suites, in final clubs/frats, and in party spaces (usually in the quad).
4. I wish I could change the mental health and academics policies here: it's hard to get recognition for legitimate mental health struggles from professors who aren't accommodating of depression, anxiety, etc.
5. Boston winters last pretty long. The weather usually turns cold by October and it's still pretty cold today (end of March).
6. Suites w/ 4 usually have their own bathroom depending on your dorm. Suites aren't generally connected to adjacent suites in the frosh dorms. Suites are always same gender in your frosh year (edit: unless you choose gender neutral housing)
7. Housing is fine; you fill out a survey your first year and the deans put you with roommates. After your first year you block with a group of up to 8 friends and you get put in one of 12 undergraduate houses together. Housing selection varies; usually it's by lottery and you pick housing in order depending on your lottery number.

Recent admit questions!,extra88,"> it's hard to get recognition for legitimate mental health struggles from professors who aren't accommodating of depression, anxiety, etc.

It’s entirely improper for faculty to recognize any medical condition, that’s the job of medical professionals who advise AEO who then determine the scope of accommodations. Accommodations must be compatible with the essentials of the course and that’s something the professor needs to work out with AEO’s help.

It’s bad that there’s such a stigma associated with mental health problems compared to other health problems but when a condition affects one’s ability to think, there’s a fundamental conflict with learning. There are many kinds of aids that can help with, say, mobility but every student has to do their own thinking. Everyone has to do the work, otherwise what is the corse, and ultimately the degree, worth?

I think it’s more important for the College to do more to help students recognize problems and receive care (sometimes including taking a leave) than for professors to make a lot of changes to their courses.",2,,False,ejxciyz,False,False,1554177515.0,2019-04-01 22:58:35

A much more important skill is working at that same level of effort for tasks you don't give a shit about or actively hate, that's a far more useful ability in life, although it's admittedly one you'd have a difficult time measuring on candidates.

Secondly, leadership is about the ability to lead others, inspiring them to work hard at things they may not necessarily enjoy, pushing them on to be the best they can be.

Neither of the examples you gave show someone inspiring other people to work their hardest, A climbs a mountain and gets people to donate to charity on his behalf, whereas a good leader would inspire people to do activities to convince others to donate to charities on *their* behalf, as well as donating to the leader.

As for B, he might be inspiring his siblings to work hard and eventually tutor others, but there's no evidence of that yet, so to claim he shows leadership qualities is about 10-20 years too premature.

"Cultural differences Harvard, Cambridge & Stanford?",pear40,"Harvard undergrad, studied abroad at Oxford, summer at Cambridge. Econ secondary at Harvard and PPE at Oxford.

In my experience, Harvard is more intense academically. That's more of a personal opinion, though. At Oxford and Cambridge, you have 1-2 hours of ""class"" per week when you meet with profs. Everything else is self-directed and you have the option to go to lectures. That was way easier for my work style. Ultimately, you'll get out of your education what you put in, regardless of institution. Oxbridge grading relies heavily on all-or-nothing end of term tests, which I despise. 

The colleges at Oxbridge have way better comradery than Harvard houses. In general, there's a much healthier social atmosphere. The drinking age being 18 makes a huge difference because people go to clubs and social organizations don't act as social gateways. I did like that Harvard was right next to a proper city - Oxford and Cambridge are too far away to just pop down to London. Oxbridge are definitely more old money. Harvard tends to have a stronger activist community, from what I've seen. There's also a different emphasis on extracurriculars. It wasn't unusual for half or more of people's time to go to extracurricular activities at Harvard - and most of these activities are pre-professional groups. It's not unusual at Oxbridge for people to have no organized extracurricular activities beside hanging out in the JCR. Organized sports are also less emphasized, as is the standard outside of American universities. One plus for me is that Harvard is four years, where as most degree programs at Oxbridge are only three. That could definitely be a positive for someone else, though.

On US vs UK

(1) the more flexible, less academic focused environment that allowed for more academic and career exploration, and at age 18 I wanted space to try different things — I could still work closely with faculty doing intense academic work if I wanted to, but that wasn't the only thing I could do to a high level. Since coming to Harvard I've pivoted my academic and career direction completely, and I really wouldn't have been able to if I went to Cambridge.

(2) the more relaxed, diverse, open, warm culture which fit my personality better. I regularly visit the UK to see my friends who are there and the sense that I get is that so much of social activity consists of mindless drinking, which I personally really didn't see the point in. You can still mindlessly drink here but at least you have more options if you didn't want that.

(3) on being entrepreneurial, there's not really a better place to be than the US —  other country's companies try to copy what business models that began years ago in the US, rarely vice versa; the opportunities you will get in tech in the US if you studied CS or were interested in VC is unparalleled.

&#x200B;

On Stanford vs Harvard

  
(1) I felt that Harvard preserved more optionality than Stanford for me — I was hugely interested in CS and entrepreneurship but also wanted to learn more about government & life sciences. I could study anything at Harvard and would still be in a world leading department with many peers and alumni in those paths, which was murkier for Stanford...

(2) City life - being from a big city, I hated Palo Alto. I'm so glad I now live in Boston and can go into the city in under 15 minutes any time.

How to widen your connections at Harvard? [Introvert Edition],timohypower2,"Hello! Definitely make sure to do a preorientation program first off. Its the easiest way to start the school year off already knowing people. I always recommend fall clean up, partially because i did it last year, but also because it provides you with the oppportunity to meet other students in your year and gives you time to learn the campus. There’s also the fip (fall international program) which my international friends loved because of all the other students they got to meet. I think this year you should be able to do both if you choose.

After preorientation, annenberg, the dining hall, is your next best bet on meeting new people and making connections. There are going to be so many people who don’t know each other, so it definitely makes it easier to meet new people early on in the year. 

Make sure to also use the class of 2022 facebook page to meet new people as well.

How to widen your connections at Harvard? [Introvert Edition],RagsIIRichesMedia,"Going into college, everyone is worried that they won't find friends or they won't fit in, but honestly, don't worry about it. Everyone finds their friend group and Harvard is such a welcoming place with so many nice and friendly people from all different backgrounds that you should have no problems finding friends! Since you're an international student, I recommend that you sign up for FIP (First-Year International Students Program), which is a pre-orientation specifically designed for international students to interact with their international peers. One of my international roommates did this program and enjoyed it a lot, he met a lot of great people and made a lot of close friends through that. Also, the first week of campus, or freshman week, is full of a lot of great events, socials, and parties to go to where you could meet a lot of new people. Also, Harvard does a good job with regards to creating a great entryway community in your dorms. You guys to have weekly study breaks where you can interact and chat with other people in your dorm entryway along with you PAF's, who are upperclassman carefully selected to help incoming freshman with any social or academic issues. Or, you can meet people at clubs, classes, or other social events! Overall, freshman year at Harvard is a time like no other, you are constantly meeting new people and there's always something fun to do. I miss it a lot. Congratulations on your acceptance and enjoy!

Tips for Freshmen?,truflove,"I was a freshman last year and I wish I knew what I know now. Definitely read that slow down article someone else linked here. What follows are my personal experiences, which not everyone will agree with, but since my friends experienced the same things, perhaps this will help. 

\- Manage your time well. Out of all things, this was my biggest issue and led to lots of stress. Perhaps you're already excellent at it, but chances are you're not. Buy a serious planner. Write down EVERYTHING you need to get done every day. Don't just write academic stuff down \- write extracurricular, social, and personal obligations. Include time for your personal interests and projects. AND SLEEP. This might sound obvious, but seriously, don't neglect it. Knowing what needs to get done and physically etching out what your week will look like will save you so much stress. Also checking tasks off is really satisfying haha. 

\-  Take that slow down advice seriously. When I arrived, I was instantly affected by the intense ambition I saw in my peers. I began to feel insecure with taking ""moderate"" courses and chased the hardest ones I could possibly take. My ego wouldn't let me do anything else. This was horrible for my physical and mental health. My grades ended up fine but I had to sacrifice so much for them. Ambition is healthy, but it often clouds judgment. You might think you want to drown yourself in real analysis and Kantian ethics simultaneously because the *idea* of being intensely absorbed in fields you're passionate about sounds appealing. And it actually is, but what you don't consider is that there are very few hours in the week, and being constantly sleep deprived, eating extremely quick meals at the berg, barely seeing your friends, and sitting in the same damn chair at whatever library for 8\+ hours every day 7 days a week is not fun. It's soul\-sucking. And come August, I guarantee your ego will shoot through the roof pressuring you to take a bunch of hard ass classes, but take a step back and remember that for the majority of people, there is more to life than doing problem sets all day. Everyone in this thread is echoing this. Take it seriously. And I'm not saying don't challenge yourself. Do that, but appropriately. 

\- Do NOT neglect your personal health. This is similar to the advice above but I mean it seriously. Sleep deprivation is extremely unhealthy, so manage your time effectively so you can get your 8 hours every night. This won't happen all the time, and that's okay, but I guarantee you that you will be very unhappy if you get carried away with not sleeping well every night; coffee will stop working at some point lmao. And more importantly, do your best to stay fit. Head to the gym and be active. Human life has changed so much in the past 10,000 years, but our bodies are mostly the same. We were not meant to stay sitting down cooped up indoors all day; that will make you unhappy. Go out, experience the world, and make use of your physical body, not just your mind.

\- Control partying and drinking/drugs. This is something I saw get out of hand for lots of people, me included. It's the first year you're actually independent, and most kids who get into Harvard probably didn't drink or do drugs in high school. Definitely go out and have fun, but try not to go out and drink multiple times a week. Harvard is gonna make you watch this alcohol harm reduction series right before the term begins, and it'll be super cheesy, but take it seriously. You don't know how many people I saw go to the hospital for over\-drinking. Remember that getting completely shit\-faced is not that fun. You feel horrible. If you choose to drink, try keeping your limit at the tipsy/kinda drunk level because past that it's just nausea, vomiting, and a shitty hangover the next day. Alcohol is physically damaging for the body, so also don't drink frequently, even if you don't have too much each time you do. Every week, as you approach Friday, a lot of your friends will be itching to to party to sort of dull the pain of an exhaustive week. It'll sound appealing (and it actually is fun), but also consider your personal interests and projects. If your week was full of academic work and you wanted to explore a personal thing of yours, don't let drinking and partying get in the way of that. Those things are fun, but only in moderation. Don't let them get in the way of things you actually want to do. 

\- Be wary of the social ladder and people who try to climb it. Yeah, it's Harvard and we're past high school, but the ""social ladder"" of popularity still exists. It will be obvious who's popular and who's not when you're in the dining hall. It will be obvious to spot someone whose goal is to get into the Phoenix. This can get to you if you feel like you're not one of the cool kids lmao; it's human to feel bad when you're not included. I also see a lot of people faking it to climb the ladder as well. I'm not really sure what my advice for this is tbh because everyone's social desires and expectations are different. I guess just take some time now to consider what you really want out of your social life.

\- Don't be afraid to reach out to the mental health services at Harvard (like CAMS) if you feel you need to. I didn't at all freshman year even though I was depressed (personal reasons). I will next year though. They're confidential and, from what friends tell me, actually help. 

Sorry for the long post, I just really wish I knew what I know now before I started. You'll make mistakes but that's just life. You'll be okay and have a blast this summer. Cheers ",22,,False,e0l7y1h,False,False,1528873561.0,2018-06-13 02:06:01

Best 200-level math classes?,gdavtor,"I did math physics and graduated a few years ago and am now four years into a Math PhD (at another institution). The following are my recommendations (in decreasing order) based on my experience. 

I would highly recommend the 232 series. The more algebraic geometry you take in undergrad, the better (unless you definitely won't study it in grad school, then don't bother). It's also just a good way to learn algebra. For example, the theory of discrete valuation rings is best learned (in my opinion) through the language of schemes. However, I am an Algebraic Geometer now, so this is a biased recommendation. 

Of course, 231 is a classic Harvard math course. No math student should graduate without taking that at some point. It's also pretty accessible. I believe this semester Hopkins is teaching it, which is awesome. He's a fantastic teacher and is one of the foremost in his field.

Another recommendation I would give is 222. Lie group theory is wonderful and I regret not taking that one. Not sure how accessible it is. 

Finally, 229 is always good. Noam is a great guy and is hilarious and an absolute genius of course. You're unlikely to find another analytic number theory course like his elsewhere. Perhaps a little less accessible. 

Overall, I would prioritize classes that are especially good at Harvard because of the experts that are there teaching them. You can take Complex Analysis anywhere (e.g. in grad school); but where Harvard shines bright is the courses I mentioned above (and others).",14,,1598034049.0,g2afrse,False,False,1597979963.0,2020-08-20 22:19:23

Final Clubs Questions​,crimsonchin68,"Hey man! I can share my knowledge, though I must add the caveat that I did not end up receiving an invitation to join a club. (I was punched and went to a couple events before being cut by the two clubs who punched me)

1) Dates vary by club. My recollection was that they went out in the middle of the fall; probably closer to the start than the end of the semester

2) Clubs are always watching and evaluating. Pre punch events start the year before, as you mentioned, but there’s no summertime eval sessions as far as I know haha

3) The process is basically a escalating series of parties/events. The first event is usually always just a party in the club’s space. The middle events are usually short outings (outdoors/NYC/etc). The last events are usually formal dinners.

4) Someone in the club might tell you - otherwise it’s pretty hard to tell. I will say that it’s impossible for me to imagine you getting invited to a pre-punch and then not get punched, unless you made some kind of horrible mistake.

5) I’m not in a position to answer that hahaha

Edit: Turns out you guys already figured out why you don’t know anything about the process. That’s a feature, not a bug. But (as far as everyone knows) it’s not as though the clubs are giving invites simply based on your zip code; they’re inviting other kids they like, and 99% of the time, it just so happens their buddies from back home are the kinds of kids they like.

If you don’t already have actual connections to the club via sports/friendships/etc. the best advice I can give you is to be someone who stands out. They’re definitely not looking for wallflowers, try to go out of your way to highlight something cool about you when you go to the event. If that sounds arbitrary, that’s because the whole process is.",12,,1561415253.0,eryn62b,False,False,1561412448.0,2019-06-24 16:40:48

Why exactly was the arrest on Yardfest night a case of police brutality?,Cowed,"The reason why people consider this to be a case of police brutality is not because there was physical force used against the student. It is considered police brutality due to the level of physical force employed to deal with (at least what most people consider to be) a real problem. As you said, the student was clearly unarmed and did not pose sufficient threat to have been beaten as severely as he was. Personally, I consider the punching to have been excessive. Regardless of how severely the student was resisting, there are ways to restrain him without beating him senselessly. I think this is why people consider it to be a case of police brutality--not because there was force employed, but because the degree of the force was excessive. I'm not sure if in the context of police brutality in the US this would be considered to exemplify the issue, but because this case is particular to the Harvard/Cambridge community, it's reasonable to see why people are considering it to be so severe. This doesn't happen often around here, and especially not to Harvard students-- until now, police brutality towards black Americans has been very foreign to most of the Harvard community, but the issue becomes a lot more real and personal when it strikes as close to home as it did this past weekend.

Whether or not you consider the arrest to be overly violent is irrelevant. I know cops get a bad rep but they are trained how to restrain people. This isn't wrestling where there are specific moves you use so as not to break the rules. They wanted to subdue the student as quickly as possible so he wouldn't risk harming himself or others. Again, I'm not a cop, but when I see people say that they believe the force was excessive it shows a certain level of arrogance that they know how to be a cop better than a trained cop does. I would like to reiterate I am not a police officer, I am a student. I do not know police training and perhaps they are trained to deal with people tripping a certain way. I just think it is ridiculous how much stock we place in the perception of this arrest when our opinions are more or less worthless.

Why exactly was the arrest on Yardfest night a case of police brutality?,TheGrammarBolshevik,"I appreciate the importance of epistemic humility: most of us here aren't cops, most of us probably don't have any expertise in how to subdue or arrest someone, etc. However, the fact that the police ""are trained how to restrain people"" is hardly decisive evidence that they acted properly. For one, police do not always adhere to their training. For another, we can't just uncritically accept that whatever police are trained to do is what they ought to do. Among other things, the police have a natural incentive to prioritize even remote threats to their own safety over the actual safety of the people they interact with.

According to the Crimson, ""[w]hile the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report."" I think we can recognize the limitations of our own knowledge while still doubting whether punching someone five times contributes reasonably, let alone proportionally, to handcuffing them, especially when they are already pinned to the ground.

The alternative seems to be like saying ""Who are we, who know nothing about guarding hen-houses, to question whether the foxes, who are trained for this sort of thing, were justified in eating a few of their charges?""",3,,False,dxolemk,False,False,1524235269.0,2018-04-20 09:41:09

That being said, this simply isn't a case of clear-cut police brutality. For the Rodney King case or Eric Garner case it doesn't take a police officer to recognize that what the police did was both unnecessary and abhorrent. What the officer did here was (in my opinion) well within the ""well I'm not a cop so I don't know what I would've done"" margin of error. I think taking down a person on psychedelics is no easy feat and the fact that the UC among other organizations jumped to call this police brutality is immensely frustrating.

Well, so you say, but if I think that punching someone repeatedly, while they are already on the ground, being held down, by two other people, is outside the margin of error, I'm not seeing what reason you've given for me to change my mind. If these discussions are going to be settled by saying ""margin of error"" and giving no further justification, that seems little better than saying that the margin of error is infinite, or at least that the only cases where we're going to second-guess the police are those cases where our gut instincts tell us to.

At any rate, this all seems rather hypothetical. If we had no way at all of knowing what's reasonable for the police to do here, that would be one thing.

This is not evidence of grade inflation.  It's evidence that people take classes that are too easy for them.  I did not get A's in all of my classes, not at all, but when I got one, I earned it -- and I was near the top in those courses, because there were relatively few A's, but if everyone had done as well as I did in those classes (or as poorly, in my other classes), they should have received the same grade as me.

Bragging,throwawayacc2K19,"It all depends on the intentions.

* When I announced I was accepted at Harvard, I did try to be as tasteful as possible, but a part of me did feel worried, as I didn't want to be perceived as bragging. Especially when I announced it to my friends.
* Then I got to meet people who were accepted at other high prestige graduate schools, and they were not only bragging - they were feeling upright superior just because an acceptance letter.

I believe there are many factors to all of this, psych is out of my field of expertise to name all the factors, but I think it has to do with self-worth, and a person's own experiences and culture.

About self-worth, a lot of people that get accepted at Top schools measure themselves by a certain aspect, maybe their  intelligence, their dedication and hard work, or even on their ambitions. This is not definitely a bad thing, at the end of the day you have been accepted to an exceptional school, but it is immature to define your self worth by it. Going to school is just a part of life. Sure, a lot of growth happens, but such growth will happen in some way or another, regardless of where you go.

About personal experiences and culture, not everyone is raised with concepts of propriety. I've read many answers on Quora saying that the richest of people, the ""old money"" type, don't really like to announce their successes that much. Why? Because it may be perceived as boastful, which is a trait of those ""uneducated"". This is a limited, and personal perspective, and while I'm by no means rich, I was raised with the same values.",4,,1557664709.0,en7kugw,False,False,1557663683.0,2019-05-12 07:21:23

How do you survive/make it through Boston winters?,chanfest22,"I came to Harvard as a freshman from California, never having seen snow in real life before. Even though folks are (hilariously) trolling you below, a lot of them probably cannot empathize with having lived in a place with good weather year round (shots fired). So here is what I recommend doing:

1. Embrace the fact that it will be freezing during the winter (though the coldest time in January you'll hopefully be away for break). First snow is actually super fun to play around in. It's the melty slush in February that will be miserable. Most of the time though, you'll be inside with tons of heat so it'll be fine.
2. Do **not** buy winter gear before coming to Boston (e.g. in Tennessee). It won't be warm enough.
3. Go to a store near Harvard Square/Boston like REI, Patagonia, North Face, etc. and get the following items. Sometimes you have to wait until \~October for all the winter stuff to come into the stores. Just call and ask.

* Warm winter jacket (e.g. [pea coat](https://www.google.com/search?q=pea+coat&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDt-aMv4PcAhWGKHwKHY-jCoEQ_AUICygC&biw=1440&bih=711) and/or [patagonia](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1440&bih=711&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=frg7W7S0MczS_wSD1Zu4Cg&q=winter+coat+patagonia&oq=winter+coat+patagonia)/[north face](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1440&bih=711&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=nLg7W9vVBKrb0gLg5J7IBg&q=winter+coat+north+face&oq=winter+coat+north+face) style jacket)
* Few warm layers (i.e. micro down jacket)

How do you survive/make it through Boston winters?,taskhomely,"Background: went to Harvard after living in the Carolinas my whole life.  Walked everyday from Union Square to HBS for several years.

Summer: There is no Spring or Fall. Winter runs from November to May then it immediately gets hot. Bostonians are in denial when they say it doesn't get hot. It does. And because no one has central AC and you have to walk or take a crowded, non-AC bus or train anywhere outside of Harvard, so the heat is far more miserable. You will think you need to dress more warmly when you start school. I did this. Big mistake. Dress like its the middle of summer. You will be walking outside a lot and classes will be crowded during shopping period and have poor AC. Also, there will be a cold snap in October, they'll turn the heat on but then it will get hot again and you'll be sweating for the rest of October in class.

Winter: In the dead of winter, pants with long johns underneath, scarf, and a long jacket with big pockets for your gloved hands. Pockets are more important than gloves. Keeping your face warm will be hard, so be ready for your eyes to freeze. I wouldn't go nuts on the winter gear though. Layers work miracles and can be put together cheaply. Also, an umbrella in the snow might look goofy but it will keep you dry and warm.

Infrastructure: Bostonians don't give a flying fuck about snow. There will be a travel ban in place if snow is really bad and you'll still see people speeding up and down the highway. Sidewalks will be shoveled on campus but will be very narrow so you have to walk single file. When the snow thaws, the sidewalks will flood between the snow banks with up to an inch or more of water. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT: GET TALL WATERPROOF BOOTS. 

Rain Noreasters: This is the hardest part to get ready for. Walking North from the river towards campus is a bitch during a noreasters - you will get soaking wet. Ponchos, rain protector for you book bag, and a wind-proof umbrella are a must.",6,,False,e1q8gcp,False,False,1530638477.0,2018-07-03 12:21:17
How do you survive/make it through Boston winters?,helveticaman,"There’s a world of logistics and infrastructure here that y’all don’t have back home. The sidewalks are almost always cleared and any snow is moved out of your way. So don’t worry about any of that. 

Instead you’ll need to plan on keeping warm. Snow boots, at least one heavy coat with a hood, gloves, winter hats or beanies, a scarf are all pretty much required on the coldest days. Proper undergarments like thermals help too. All this you can get when you’re here (it also doesn’t make sense to buy it in the South honestly).

Harvard Extension School Questions,bakamanju,"*""For the ""Earn-Your-Way-In"" admissions, I was thinking of taking the three suggested courses that are on the Extension School's website (EXPO 15, EXPO 25, and MATH E-3). The advisor I spoke to mentioned that they would count towards the degree itself. Any thoughts on this? How were the courses themselves?""*

Can't speak about these since I didn't take these classes. It will depend on your field whether you take two or three classes for admission. As someone in the ALM Bioeng/Biotech thesis track, we only required two classes for admission - Proseminar and a life sciences course.

""*I noticed that there's an on-campus requirement. How was this for folks? Was it a pain trying to find parking/getting a parking pass from the university? (I live a little under an hour north of Cambridge in Maine)""*

I live in the area so the on-campus wasn't difficult for me. However, I have met people who have traveled in to take classes and some even just do the on-campus during the January and summer sessions. It really depends on what you can manage given your day to day life. Many people pursuing the graduate program are working full time in either the small biotech space, pharma, consulting firms, private businesses, etc. It is a pain if you drive, but if your class meets late enough, you may be able to snag a spot. I'd park at one of the Red line stations and commute down (Alewife down to Harvard) if you are worried unless you want to try your luck.

*""How were the online classes/courses? I'm no stranger to online learning, but I do know that every school has their own ""spin"" when it comes to online education.""*

This is a hit or miss but most of the time it was enjoyable. Certain professors make the most out of the platform while others struggle to find a happy medium since they have primarily only taught on a board and gave a physical lecture. They is very good discussion during the classes and I found most to be very helpful in my learning.

""*How's financial aid for the Extension School? I noticed that it was mentioned online, and briefly said by the advisor I spoke with, but is it generous (if needed, I would only be taking sixty-four credits for the degree, as I will have sixty-four credits transferring into the program itself; also, I currently have a 3.67 GPA, if that goes into academic scholarship decision-making).""*

This is also dependent on your financial need. My understanding that there is slightly more financial aid opportunities for those pursuing a ALB than anyone pursuing a graduate degree (we get a piece of a nice grant and loan options).  As for transfer credit, I'm not qualified to answer that question since I pursued a traditional Bachelor degree at another institution but chose a job afterwards rather than jumping straight back into a traditional degree program.

*""And lastly, for those of whom who have graduated from this program, is it worth it? I've read other comment sections/blogs/posts where some have had difficulties with their degrees, due to the phrasing of the degree itself (""Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies,"" even though they majored/concentrated in Environmental Studies), and was just wondering if there was any sort of ""stigma"" attached to the degree, or if the majority of what I read was just a bunch of hot air.""*

The experience is what you make of it. If you are honest with your credentials, your effort will speak for itself down the road. Respect the guidelines in place. Harvard Extension School is **not** Harvard College. It is easy in conversation to say you went to Harvard University but can easily be taken out of context leading to either trolls or ""stigma"" which I'm sure you have encountered by just sifting through this sub-Reddit/Twitter/etc. I am taking a class where someone graduated from HES with an ALB and is now in medical school at Mayo Clinic doing an MD/PhD but also is a Teaching Assistant for the course. His track is a bit unique all around but definitely motivational for those that wish to pursue the program. Thus, it is what you make of your experience and leveraging your network/experience whether you are going to pursue further education or go into the work force.

I'd be happy to provide more context if you're interested. Just DM me.",5,,False,f0jyl8v,False,False,1568666052.0,2019-09-16 15:34:12
Harvard Extension School Questions,PeptoBismark,"* I took Expo 15 and Expo 25, mostly to get my confidence up after being out of school for a decade. They're pretty much the same AP English course/Freshman English course every school requires to prove that you an write can essay. Expo-15 had a smaller class size and more English-as-a-second-language students, though I took that in 2001, so that may no longer be true.

* Can't answer, I lived and worked on the Red Line while I attended.

* Online courses were just starting up while I was there. The videos were available to the local students as well, I remember being impressed with the triple-synced-screens from one of the programming courses that let you watch the lecturer, his programming terminal, and the board at the same time.

* Can't answer, I was using tuition reimbursement from my job. You'll find that the technical classes are priced significantly higher than the liberal arts courses, as most of the students will be professionals taking a particular course, rather than degree students.

* Yes, it was worth it. The vast majority of the instructors are masters of their craft, and teaching in the evenings to have even more students to teach. Highlights for me were Boston history taught by an emeritus BU professor, intro to geology taught by an emeritus MIT professor, and Chaucer taught by the editor of 'The Riverside Chaucer'.

As to the stigma, I've always put Extension School on my resume, and in conversation started with, ""You know those posters on the T about Discover Harvard in the Evening? I did that."" I also refrained from wearing anything with a Harvard logo until after getting the degree, so I probably avoided a lot of drama. 

One final note - if you're transferring in the maximum 64 credits, you'll want to keep an eye on the Harvard Instructor(HI) requirement. I wound up taking an extra two classes at the end to fulfill that one.",3,,False,f0kidvr,False,False,1568680119.0,2019-09-16 19:28:39

Harvard Extension School Questions,hungryforbread,"* I'm a bit jealous that prospective students have this option now! I would definitely do it, as these three courses are cheaper and easier than other courses that one could pick and jeopardize their admission chances with. While they count towards the degree itself in terms of overall credits, I don't believe EXPO 25 fulfills the writing intensive course requirement. I think Math E-3 does indeed count towards quantitative reasoning though. These courses are very easy. I had to take EXPO 25 with two other courses of my choosing to get in. EXPO 15 is an easier version of 25.
* On-campus requirement is fine. Most HES classes that I've taken in person started at 7pm. Just be careful with traffic on exam days. There were times that I was nearly late driving my car to an exam, and I lived close to campus. You need to account for the time it takes to get out of the parking garage and walk across campus to wherever your class is. Parking can be difficult to find on the street without a pass, but one of my peers sometimes had luck parking on the street next to Sever Hall. Once you're an admitted degree candidate, you could get a parking pass for \~$120 for the year at the place where you get your ID card.
* I thought they were generally fantastic so long as you're disciplined enough to watch the lectures and do the readings. You need a stable internet connection for web proctored exams and web conference classes. And you will be told to leave the class session if you're entering from inside a car.
* Not sure as I didn't qualify for financial aid.
* Can answer this one at the end of the Fall semester.",3,,False,f0jtbkq,False,False,1568662551.0,2019-09-16 14:35:51

For my admission essay I wrote about my ambivalent attitude towards science as a form of knowledge, that it had to be approached with a humanities understanding. It was a pretty subtle piece of work for a teenager. While at Harvard I knew plenty of hard-working ethnically Asian students. None of them showed that subtlety. There were lots of non-Asian kids who had done exceptional things (like, for example, my roommate who got his board game published). Individuality is a Western creation, it is not Asian. This lack of personal uniqueness has big consequences. There are no Asian counterparts to Galileo, Newton, Edison, Einstein, Steve Jobs. The Wright brothers are a perfect example. Why didn't some smart Chinese mechanics invent the airplane first? Were any even trying? Harvard is recognizing this lack of individuality in its admissions, as it should.**",10,,False,e3hwmbz,False,False,1533243360.0,2018-08-02 15:56:00

I feel like this is the ultimate truth that everyone is uncomfortable expressing. People are generally going to support the policies that help them the most, and I guess a lot of my frustration is people pretending like that's not the case.

> If names and race were stripped from applications, schools like Harvard would have a much larger population of Asian Americans.

Absolutely. Historically the rates of white students at Harvard have floated around 50%. MIT (my alma mater), has slightly weaker affirmative action, and around 40% white students. Caltech, which only factors in race at the waitlist level, around 30-35%, and Berkeley, which is by California law not allowed to consider race in the application, is at about 25%. Berkeley has so many Asian students that it breaks out its Asia demographics by specific country. The evidence is pretty overwhelming that while affirmative action may disproportionately help under-represented minorities, it also significantly helps whites, almost entirely at the expense of Asian applicants.

I wonder how much of this is a holdover from a much data-poorer environment.

I think this is true to a certain extent, but the interplays between race and class are fairly complex such that AA is more than a proxy for SES diversity. [This NYT Upshot article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html) offers a good explanation of why affirmative action based on race might be better even when it does help high-SES minority students.

These are difficult questions. Anyone at the school knows that Harvard is not like other colleges - it's more competitive, and many would say that it generally seems more stressful than many other colleges. (Obviously there are similar colleges across the country) Just like going into a stressful, competitive job, there will be challenges along the way. Not everyone is cut out for every job, and not everyone is cut out for Harvard for some of the same reasons.

I'm glad that there are conversations about mental health at Harvard.

However, do you guys think that Harvard isn't doing enough? I receive updates about CAMHS and SMHL fairly regularly. I firmly believe that Harvard takes mental health issues at our school seriously.

If anything, I believe Harvard should make it abundantly clear about what prospective students are getting themselves into. Harvard can be a pressure cooker, and students can burn out just as people burn out of high pressure jobs.

How is the CS department?,InternetPerson29,"The CS department is small compared to big CS schools (MIT, CMU) but has really top-notch faculty and is in the midst of huge growth (hiring new faculty and building in Allston). It's really easy to get to know professors and do really cool research. Since there aren't that many graduate students in CS, professors spend a lot of time working with undergraduates as well, which is great if you are interested in doing research and connecting with professors.

You can take a look at the CS course list to get a sense of what you could see yourself taking. I would recommend jumping in with CS61 instead of CS50 if you have CS experience (you don't have to know C beforehand imo) and are up for a challenge.

I have no complaints about the CS department so far.",21,,1513286621.0,dr9bsp0,False,False,1513286364.0,2017-12-14 15:19:24

Profs, for the most part, are ridiculously approachable. If you are interested in their work you can you can drop into their office hours and discuss it with them. This is something you don't get at most schools. As for taking cs50, if you have cs experience it is a pretty easy class.

How is the CS department?,thunderfox,"Background: I did my undergrad at Harvard in electrical engineering and I'm a CS PhD student at CMU now.

It really depends on what you are interested in, but I found Harvard's approach to CS to be a lot more theory-based than I would like compared to CMU or MIT. That's not to say that the department is not a strong department, its just that there needs to be more time for the department to mature and move away from its Applied Math roots. Conversely, the few ""hands-on"" courses that are there seem to have way too much busywork and end up just being a ton of implementation work. I found the Machine Learning course (CS 181) to be straight-up awful but from what I understand there has been some faculty changes since when I briefly took it and dropped the course before the Add/Drop period.

I would mirror what others have said in this thread and I would strongly avoid CS50. It was what turned me off to CS and if it wasn't for a particularly amazing CS faculty member who took me under his wing and mentored me, I would have not ever considered CS. CS50 caters to its own brand not to those who are genuinely interested in computer science. You would never see anything like that course in any ""real"" CS department.

Woah... Just admitted to Harvard for graduate school.,GregoryPecker,"Congratulations! I'm sure you are incredibly excited to begin school as you should be! I finished up a Master's last year, so I can speak to the experience as a grad student, albeit on a slightly different schedule and far shorter timeline than you'll see as you pursue your Ph.D. Here are my thoughts: 
   
1. One challenge with answering this question is that you didn't state what you'll be studying and since Harvard's campus is incredibly dispersed throughout Cambridge, it's hard to give you precise suggestions. As an extreme example, it's roughly a [30 minute walk](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/John+G.+Wolbach+Library,+60+Garden+St+MS-56,+Cambridge,+MA+02138,+United+States/Harvard+Innovation+Lab,+Western+Avenue,+Boston,+MA/@42.3727972,-71.1308142,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e3776c9a6f8f65:0x66319a9a21855456!2m2!1d-71.1276599!2d42.3815243!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e377602b41553f:0xfdc59254062cc57a!2m2!1d-71.1241457!2d42.3640707!3e2) from the Wolbach Library to the Harvard iLab. There are dozens of places, both on campus and just off campus, for coffee and food and the best options will be dependent on where you live and are spending most of your time. Each academic area tends to have only 1 or 2 actual on-campus locations though, so you'll likely find yourself venturing off-campus. Some of my personal favorites: coffee and sandwiches at Darwin's (locations on Cambridge St & Mt. Auburn St), food and drinks at Cambridge Common, burgers at Shake Shack (no In N' Out, but it'll do), breakfast at Zoe's, healthy-ish food at B. Good, pizza at Angelo's, waffles at Zinneken's. Oh, and since you're from California, people are going to tell you that the Mexican food in Boston is good, but it's not. It's pretty bad. Yes, even Ana's and Felipe's. I found that Mexican, and for that matter any other cuisine that uses a lot of spice (Indian, Thai, etc.) to be pretty bland in Boston. Get your fix while you're still in burrito-heaven!  
  
2. Harvard has a couple of athletic centers, with the largest being Malkin. I purchased a yearlong pass, but I ended up not using it very much, preferring to exercise outdoors and explore Cambridge/Boston while running and cycling.  
  
3. I also moved from California and this is the question I feel most competent to answer, having made this move myself. Things you'll need: 2 jackets- one waterproof jacket that you can wear in rain/snow and one down jacket that will keep you warm. You can find some brands that combine both into one jacket, but I preferred the ability to layer. At least one pair of good waterproof boots. I had some cheap ones and the first day that I had water soak through and had cold, wet feet was a terrible one. Gloves, a scarf or two, wool socks or socks designed for boots and the cold, a beanie, and something to keep your ears warm if you aren't going to wear a beanie. I also bought long johns that I could layer under jeans if it got really cold. While I didn't get them, I'd recommend at least one pair of water-resistant pants that you can wear for the really cold, rainy days.   
Honestly, I would wait until you're in Boston and then go to some clothing stores to pick up clothes if you aren't in a rush. It will be easier to talk to salespeople to figure out what you need and it will be fewer items of clothing for you to ship out there in advance.  
  
4. Harvard has a CRAZY number of libraries. [73, to be precise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Library). This all depends on your study style. I was personally a silent-floor-of-the-library type of person and would go to different libraries that had silent floors. Study at least once in the main room of Widener Library. It's like something out of a movie.  
  
5. I lived in a house I found on Craigslist, which worked out phenomenally, so I can't speak to this as much. I had friends who lived in Cronkhite, so I can mention that briefly, but don't know any of the other graduate dorms. The biggest pro to Cronk is that the students living there had some of the strongest bonds and social networks of all of my classmates, by virtue of living in the same place. The biggest con, in my opinion, is that the meal plan was mandatory and students got pretty sick of the food after a while (even though I thought it was great when I visited!). There are common kitchens, but we all know using a dorm kitchen isn't like using a kitchen in your own apartment.

Woah... Just admitted to Harvard for graduate school.,xiipaoc,"Harvard Square is *full* of food.  Some of it is even very good!  I graduated a while ago so there's new stuff now, like food trucks in front of the Science Center.  You will not be allowed into undergrad dining halls, by the way.

No idea whether the gym/pool/rec centers are good or not.  I didn't really go.  The gym was fine for my uses.

Winter clothing, OK.  So.  I'm from Florida.  I have three jackets: a light jacket, a medium jacket, and a heavy jacket.  Light jacket is basically just a windbreaker, useful if it's 55° like right now.  Medium jacket is useful from the 40°'s to the 30°'s, so much of fall/winter/spring.  Heavy jacket is for anything below; it's a big puffy ski jacket.  I think there are other choices, but that's what I have.  I have a wool hat and some gloves in my heavy jacket's pockets.  I don't wear scarves.  Same kind of pants all year round, same kind of sneakers, too.  (I'm a guy; my wife does things differently, I think, though she sometimes borrows my jackets.)

Good places to study will depend on your style -- likely, though, your office is where you'll want to study.

Didn't go to Harvard for grad school, but living off-campus is probably not a bad idea.  However, I know rents have gone up in Cambridge and Somerville, so maybe it's less good now.",2,,False,d023jki,False,False,1455644203.0,2016-02-16 11:36:43

> 2. Does Harvard have a nice gym, pool, or recreation center?

I know there's some kind of recreation center, but there aren't too many pictures of the interior online.? 
Hemenway is supposed to be the graduate student gym. It's on the law school campus, so it''s mostly law students, but I do see students from the other graduate schools there. It can get pretty crowded, and you're lucky if there's an open treadmill when you walk in between 7-8am or 4-6pm. The weight area can get pretty cramped as well. I haven't been to any of the other athletic facilities, so I can't speak to those.
> 5. Have any of you guys lived in graduate dorms? I believe there are four buildings to choose from. Which one would you recommend?

I live in one of the Gropius dorms, similar to Richards or Child hall. While it cannot be beaten for price or convenience, I'm literally living in a concrete box. The standard rooms are just over 100 ft^2 so it can get claustrophobic at times. Also, there's no air conditioning, and only one window, so it's miserable in the heat.  It also bears noting that you share a kitchen with several floors, so cooking is also a hassle.",2,,False,d02i333,False,False,1455663919.0,2016-02-16 17:05:19

Quincy House hype,WikiTextBot,"**Narcissism of small differences**

The narcissism of small differences (German: der Narzissmus der kleinen Differenzen) is the thesis that communities with adjoining territories and close relationships are especially likely to engage in feuds and mutual ridicule because of hypersensitivity to details of differentiation. The term was coined by Sigmund Freud in 1917, based on the earlier work of British anthropologist Ernest Crawley. In language differing only slightly from current psychoanalytic terminology, Crawley declared that each individual is separated from others by a taboo of personal isolation, a narcissism of minor differences.

FUP is a fantastic program for learning about engaging in social justice issues at Harvard and in Boston, which, as someone noted, is totally doable without doing FUP.  FAP is an amazing gateway into the arts community.  Dorm crew is great for making some cash before starting school.

FOP is peerless as a more holistic orientation to life at Harvard.  Not only do you come into opening days with a tight group of friends you spent an incredibly fun week bonding with in the woods, but also the leaders are specifically trained to give FOPpers tools to navigate the fast-paced and often stressful transition to college.  By facilitating reflection, building self-awareness, and creating a safe and open space for people to just get to know each other and chat about their hopes and fears for a week, FOP provides a solid intro no matter your interests or background.

Having missed out on these programs, I can tell you that you don't miss out on too much. If you want to do one of the programs, then it is probably going to be fun, and your choice won't matter ultimately. If you are an extroverted person, then you will have no problem making plenty of friends. The nice thing is that these programs give you an opportunity to meet like-minded people, which can be helpful during the transition to college, especially if you feel that you are shy, introverted, etc. If you want to do one, whatever the reason, pick something that you would genuinely enjoy. 

Moreover, if you want to earn some money and meet some cool peeps, dorm crew is great. (I know people who need to do it for money, and rich students who didn't need to, and did it anyway, so you shouldn't feel hesitant to do it in any way!)

That said, I think that FOP gives you an opportunity to explore the outdoors and go on a camping trip in a relatively safe way, which is something you may not have the time to do for again. You will definitely have the time to volunteer through PBHA and there are lots of arts programs during term-time.

No matter which you get though, make sure you get 16gb of ram.

If you can afford it, I'd recommend a 13"" MacBook Pro with a 10th gen i5 and 16gb of ram.

I was also amazed at how many people with CS backgrounds couldn't do this. Some had never written anything in college. There was one person in particular I worked with who did something cool technically and was asked by his manager to write up what he did so that others could learn from it and see how important it was.

Using that frame work, it’s not that I think Harvard is bad at engineering, it’s that *actual* engineering itself is a difficult field to get into and not as rewarding as your work to get there might suggest. Even graduate engineer friends at MIT are not trying to do engineering but rather something more analytical like consulting.

If you feel as though you have to prove yourself, good! Tell them what you got out of your education. Why would you want someone to assume your accomplishments based off the university's name anyways. Take all this place has to offer and make yourself an amazing person.

Secondly, let me reassure you that you are a student at none other than Harvard University. Your school color is crimson and your degree will read the same as ours. If it is the classes that makes a student, you attend the same classes. If it is the admissions that makes a student, you've proven yourself with your own means and determination. If it is the school that makes a student, here at Harvard, tell them you belong to Harvard Extension School, a school of people who have full time jobs on top of their education, of military service members who cannot stay in one place, of students from the most diverse demographics in the university. And I would add, that I'd have it no other way.

Harvard University Extension Student - Impostor Syndrome?,harvard12345,"Throwaway because I never post on Reddit. 

You are a Harvard student, point blank. The ""extension school"" or ""continuing education"" concept is not unique to Harvard, and hundreds of other colleges confer degree programs through the distance study or non-traditional delivery model. Do you think a student who has a degree from Columbia CVN (Columbia's online degree programs) graduates with a Columbia CVN degree? No. They're a Columbia graduate. The same is true with UPenn (having recently launched an online Bachelor's degree), Johns Hopkins (Engineering for Professionals), Cal-Berkeley (MS in Data Science), Georgia Tech (MS in Cyber/MS/Analytics), and many many others. 

Often times, as a society, we are hung up on the idea of exclusivity. Admission to Harvard College is, and always will be, a sign of prestige, hard work, and dedication. However, you have to remember the world is changing, and democratizing access to a high-quality education is crucial to forward progress. 

If people ask where you go/went to school, say Harvard. Or say a school in Cambridge. Or don't say anything at all. At the end of the day, most people don't care. The ones who do are just projecting their own insecurities. 

Context: MLA '17. I attend the Harvard club routinely in NY, go to alumni meetups, and have used my Harvard degree to secure Director-level positions at Fortune 500 companies.

Anyone in Winthrop have thoughts on the house climate controversy?,pear40,"Not in Winthrop but my ex was so I spent a ton of time there. Even before he decided to represent Weinstein people hated the housemasters. Apparently, they fired a beloved house administrator after she refused to to plan their kid's birthday party (which was absolutely not a part of her job description). They also allegedly have spent tons of the college's money on their own personal living space (like dropping $30k on a chandelier for their personal residence). Beyond scandals, they were just shitty housemasters --- always absent, not invested in the community, pretentious, etc. As for the current climate, I can't speak to that. All I can guess is that a shitty situation has gotten even worse.  


I honestly don't get why the administration is doing so much to protect them. The administration recognizes the social climate on campus is shitty and their proposed antidote is to beef up house life.

"A thought provoking article, should be noted though that it was written by a University of Pennsylvania graduate.",JS0D,"While certain arguments here certainly warrant attention, I feel like he is arguing that all students at selective colleges and universities have some sort of deep-seated inferiority complex constantly looming, governing all our thoughts and actions — something that is probably true in some cases, but does not resonate with me personally or with many people I have met. Sure, maybe there is a hierarchy built into people’s minds, but in any case it is more of a rough outline than a strict ranking, as we all know, and my personal opinion is that I have not felt the need to publicly validate myself by comparing Harvard to other schools.

That being said, as I write this I realize that deep down I believe that Harvard would probably be at the top of my rankings if I were to really make a “hierarchy”. Not for his reasoning though, probably more because I genuinely love the school. Still, maybe I’m a hypocrite, and he isn’t *so* wrong after all.",9,,1549338400.0,efrumv3,False,False,1549338201.0,2019-02-04 21:43:21
"A thought provoking article, should be noted though that it was written by a University of Pennsylvania graduate.",,"Well, this reads like an apologist article if I've ever read one. 

I'm a Harvard grad from nearly 20 years ago. I studied economics and work in finance. I'm happy to report that my peers from Harvard are significantly smarter, harder working, and more interesting than most other pools of graduates (particularly those of Penn).

My favorite anecdote of this (and its true) is from my training program at then investment bank I joined out of Harvard. The bank taught the program in modules, then gave tests after every week or so long module. The first module was accounting, which, as a Harvard grad I had no experience. After the test a snivelling graduate of Wharton-Penn came over to ask score I had gotten on the exam. Upon hearing my score, she exclaimed, ""I GOT THE SAME SCORE AS THE KID FROM HARVARD."" 

I congratulated her on having only taken two years of accounting at Wharton to achieve such a feat. Both her reaction to the respective exam results as well as those results themselves convince me that most of the stereotypes we have about those other universities are based in more than a grain of truth.

"Elitism, Harvard and Dumb Stereotypes",crimsonchin68,"From my three years spent here as an undergrad I would agree with the characterization that Harvard isn't especially outwardly elitist. I don't think anyone would disagree that the stereotype stems from a time when Harvard wasn't concerned with diversity or even absolute merit. Students during those times were probably also more outwardly elitist, which stemmed from the fact that so much of the student body came from the same areas and the same background, and by comparison students are extremely diverse both geographically and economically, and outward elitism has died off almost 100%.

With that being said, I still believe that there is some more subtle elitism that manifests itself in discussions about which college is best or who is credible in any debate.

It's really hard to articulate how exactly the elitism manifests itself, but it's everywhere at the law school.

Yeah, I went to law school in the late 90s, but I was at University of Texas. There *WERE* some pretty elitist attitudes there too, and I think that's just law school culture. I never could figure out why people acted the way they did - I remember thinking: why do these guys go around provoking each other all the time - don't they understand that these are their future colleagues and people they'll get case referrals from?? And this was back in ye olden days when grading in law school was a real tyranny. Didn't grok civ pro in first year and blew a C on your transcript? No summer clerkship for you. And wave dreams of being a law clerk on the circuit after law school farewell...

What I can say for sure - if it's any help - is that people DO finally figure out that all politics is *truly* local.

Incoming Freshman Concerns :(,xiipaoc,"> I know for a fact most Harvard students will be wildly skilled in all these departments, putting me at a severe disadvantage.

Heh.  No.  They'll be just like you.  Don't worry about it!  You will almost certainly be with a few people much smarter than you (unless you're those people yourself), but most everyone else will be on the same level.  Just don't procrastinate too much, I guess.

> For those of you who also moved from far away, how did you find adjusting to the environment at Harvard?

You should have money.  It sounds like Harvard provides everything you need.  It does not.  You may want to go out, for example, or buy things for your dorm.  You'll want to buy books and supplies.  Drinks from the soda machine.  Stuff like that.  You don't need a lot of money, but you do need some.  Obviously, getting a job on campus will help with that, but you'll definitely want to come with some or you'll find yourself unable to do basic things like take the T or attend events with admission.  Again, we're talking enough for basic necessities here, not being rich.  You don't need to be rich!

As for coming from far away, you'll definitely want to have a warm jacket and a medium jacket, at least.  And you may want to call your parents every so often?  Is it that hard to call your mother?  She poured her blood and sweat and tears into raising you and *this* is how you repay her?  ...Sorry, I have Jewish parents!  But it's really not a big deal.  I'm from Florida, which is pretty far.  Turns out I actually like it up here.  Who knew?  So I stayed up here after I graduated, and I've been here ever since.  It's nice!  You'll be fine!  Soon enough -- as in, like, within the first few weeks -- Harvard will feel like home.  You'll go someplace else for the day, and you'll come back and see Annenberg and the John Harvard statue and the annoying-ass tourists you have to maneuver around and you'll know that you're home.",22,,False,d5tjq2q,False,False,1469654879.0,2016-07-27 16:27:59

Incoming Freshman Concerns :(,reedolly,"I didn't go to Harvard for undergrad, but I attended a selective private liberal arts school on the East Coast. I also moved quite far from home and had some initial feelings of inadequacy and concerns about homesickness. 

About the inadequacy - I didn't let that hold me back and I did just fine, if not just as good or better than friends who attended elite private schools. (I attended a good, but not elite, public HS.) Don't be too hard on yourself because it's not worth the energy. Don't be scared of setbacks such as a C here and there and possibly even a C grade. Harvard is meant to be challenging, and you won't achieve perfection, so just keep a reasonable mindset and take pride in your work ethic that got you in the gates.

In terms of homesickness, I'm going to be honest - I did feel homesick the first year, but it got easier and easier with each year. Looking back on it, I grew so much and benefited so much from following educational opportunity and I'm still just as close with the most important people from back at home (best friends, family, mentor figures, etc.). That's not to say that you won't grow and change, but that's the point of higher education :)

Changing views of online learning?,SoulCacher,"I've always said that what works to teach one, may not work for all.  As an HES degree candidate, I find that online-live-lecture style classes let me absorb information faster than any of the other HES methods. When I say this, I'm actually including in-classroom where I do fine, but tend to get distracted.  So while the other 3 commenters don't think it's an ""equal replacement"" or ""comes anywhere near...the on-campus learning experience,"" if it's about the *learning* and not the *socializing* then each student is going to learn differently and we need to account for that.

There are *some* students who absolutely will learn better online, and *some* students who get distracted, *need* the in-person interaction (vs Zoom) in order to succeed.  This may be because they get distracted or have trouble separating workflows, like Wassukhani (not judging, just using your example).  It might be for other reasons.  And while I agree that peer-bonding is an important part of the college experience, and living in a dorm is a *fantastic* experience, neither of those things count toward a conferred degree from any accredited institution, and peer-bonding can still happen over Zoom. After-all, no one in the workforce current cares whether you lived on-campus, off-campus, or commuted to get your degree. If the curriculums for online and in-person are the same, then why should a degree learned online be any different?\*

If anything, as more people work from home, learning online collaboration skills, e-meeting etiquette, and how to follow the lead of someone you've never met in person I think become *more* important than the in-person college equivalent.  Case-in-point, one of my clients hired me to set them up for remote working, and is now discussing downsizing their permanent office space because distance-working has made them more–not less–productive (socializing in an office is fun, but it's also a productivity albatross).  It think quite a few companies are going to come to this same realization, and that we'll see a substantial increase in the percentage of America's work white-collar workforce that are working from home. If that happens, the people who don't have the skills/discipline/environment to work from home will weed themselves out.

Changing views of online learning?,SoulCacher,"As someone who's worked on-and-off, but now permanently, from home since 1998 I had this problem, too.  Here's how I overcame it, maybe it will help you out, too:

1. Physical separation
   1. My ""work"" computer (MacBook pro) isn't the same as my gaming computer (8700K, 2808 TI, Valve Index).
   2. My work desk and gaming area are in separate rooms
   3. Work stuff is in the work room, Game stuff is in the game room
2. Work/Play/Rest Separation:
   1. My computers are generally downstairs, and my bedroom is upstairs, climbing the stairs is a mental separation for me.
   2. My recording studio (I'm a voice actor, too) is also upstairs, but down the hall from my bedroom - I have a second dock for my laptop just outside the studio.
   3. My bedroom has zero screens in it.  No TV, no computer, no iPad, etc... My phone charges on the night-stand (in case of emergencies) but by my own rule I don't use it for anything other than emergency phone calls (actual calls, not text/video conversations) in the bedroom.
3. Visual Cues
   1. My lighting is different in each area
      1. Office area is yellow-ish light
      2. Gaming area is natural light + white
      3. Living/Family room is dimmable soft white + natural
      4. Bedroom is Phillips Hue (Energize in the morning Twilight @ Night)
   2. My office is decorated like an office Desk, printer, paperwork, whiteboard
   3. My game area has images of Ghostbusters, Supergirl and The Flash, and a puzzle-style workout floor.
4. I set a schedule:
   1. I wake up and go to sleep at roughly the same time every day.
   2. I use automatic Do Not Disturb on my phone to enforce this (with emergency people able to get through)
   3. I drink my coffee and read the news in the morning before I read/reply to emails/texts (as though I'm making my way into the office, and can't see it until I get there)
   4. I take regular breaks (like lunch) at roughly regular times during the day, and don't read emails during those breaks
   5. I don't play games until I'm done working for the day (usually 6-7p)
   6. I observe ""weekends"" and severely limit how often/quickly I'll respond to work emails on those days.
5. Collaboration issues are minimal once you're used to them, and if you use the right tools.
   1. I've been remote as part of Agile Dev teams where some of us are in WA/CA, some are in NV, and some are in India.  Collaboration is fine, when structured properly. (We used VSS for version control back then, it's now Team Foundation Server, I think.
   2. The Hollywood projects I've been involved with are often remote pre-and-post production, they use a different system than Agile, but it also works fine - Again, version / collaboration control is the most important - and everyone needs to heed the Director.
   3. My agency staff work remote on major ad campaigns.  We all do our parts, and online live files (Presentations, Artwork, Campaign strategy, etc) we have as many as 10 people literally working in the same file, but we all know what we're doing and have worked together for years (Google Docs / One Drive to facilitate)
   4. Multi-national companies, FYI, at the C, VP, and even Director / worker levels, have been doing this for years.  VW, for example, has a shared platform between Audi and Porsche, and the engineers for each team are in separate locations. Coordination is ridiculously important.  (There's a really good LucasFilm/Porsche example right now where the teams got together for a few days/week, then collaborated to build a Taycan/Star Wars fighter craft working remotely for the duration - [**https://tinyurl.com/swfzjpl**](https://tinyurl.com/swfzjpl)  they switch to remote collaboration around 5:30)
   5. Removing the non-essential water cooler conversation also tends to make people (as a whole) more productive, not less. Admittedly there are some who need that pseudo-friend-style interaction to form a bond with their coworkers, but in the current PC/# era - that kind of socialization/fraternization @ the office is dangerous anyway.
   6. It's true, there are some people who can't ""get used to it"" those people aren't part of any remote-team very long. Transversely the ones who excel at remote collaboration are the ones who become the project managers, leaders, etc.

Finally, nowadays I do VO and own an Ad Agency... I've learned one thing in my 25 years in the workforce:  In my trade, nothing is as ""emergency"" as everyone wants it to be, and panicking/responding without thought and consideration leads to bad results.  This isn't to say there aren't times when I need to act quickly, but ""Don't Panic"" is as true a mantra today as it was when Douglas Addams wrote THGTTG in 1979.

Maybe this will help you, maybe it won't.  Hope it does!

Changing views of online learning?,SoulCacher,"I'm not going to disagree with you that there's a difference, because there is.   I will say, though, that those same conversations don't necessarily have to be in person (reddit, as one example - TED talks as another).  And clearly the 'net is going to have a hard time replicating coursework labs... In Academia, I firmly believe that whether or not online collaboration will work comes down to the field, professor, TAs, and students involved.  In my dozen or so live web-conference classes, I've had some real winners, and real stinkers.  If you're talking about friends that aren't necessarily in the same classes getting together and chatting about coursework over coffee or in a club, that's a little harder, but I'm certain it's still doable. (I've met friends via HES in different fields and we get together and chat fairly often.)

Please understand that I'm not at all defending online-only pre-recorded classes (which aren't at all the same), but in a Zoom-style lecture setting with real interaction between the Prof/TA and students (in addition to the lecture), there's not much to be gained by being in the same physical room.  If there's something I'm missing, then I would argue that VR Chat/Big Screen (or something yet-to-be-invented by a Harvard grad that's a bit more advanced) could accomplish whatever's left over except physical touching of one another.

One thing I think is very true is that there are smarter people than I working to make online collaboration better than it is now.  I'm a fan of VR, so I hope that's the way it winds up going.

CS124 or CS51?,,"I took 124 when I was a freshman (after 50), and I absolutely loved the course! I thought it made sense to take Algorithms earlier, than to wait two years of college before taking it - in thinking about interview prep + future CS courses I could take. However, I didn't have any competitive programming / interview prep background going into the class, so I always felt like I needed to catch up with the top of the class to do well. On top of the 10-15 hours I spent on that week's pset, I spent another 10 hours each week reading the two textbook, doing section problems, and doing additional textbook/online example problems. You are also taking the class with many students who had already learned and practiced some amount of the material in 121 beforehand.

Having a strong math background really, really helps (like math 25 or above) -- the psets were 75% theory/proofs, and the exams were all theory and a lot of mathematical thinking. That said, I don't know how the class will operate given Jelani is no longer teaching it, though I think graduated seniors said Mitzenmacher values theory even more than Jelani. I recommend shopping both courses, and also start studying 124's material over winter break in case. Like many here have said, 51 is a great course for building programming fundamentals, so you can't go wrong either way. I also knew some freshmen who took 51 and 124 at the same time, so that's an option as well (though I wouldn't recommend them both if you're still planning to take a proof heavy math class too).

Writing Placement Test,randomnese,"A few tips for analyzing texts:

\- Start without any assumptions or agenda in mind. Just read and take in the text at face value. Don't get ahead of yourself and analyze as you go, since you'll definitely miss the forest for the trees.

\- On a second read, keep mental note of interesting trends that you may have osmosed through the first parse. Trends can be recurring images/symbols, structures (in-line poems, extended parenthetical sections, etc.), progressions (breakdown of narrative voice, shifts in mood, etc.), basically anything that has a pattern. Trends can be antipatterns as well: if you notice one text doing something consistently and a different text doing an opposite trend, take note of that as well!

\- Then you can start drilling in deeper. Start looking for meaning. Everything the author made is a choice, conscious or subconscious, and it's your job to determine which authorial choices are 1) worth pointing out and 2) why they are worth pointing out. If there's a recurring symbol, think of what purpose it serves (does it occur before significant points? does it bookend the narrative? does it connect/juxtapose with other symbols?). If there are sections of very short, telegraphic sentences, ask why that occurs (is the narrator becoming more urgent? what's the tone?).

\- Ultimately tie together things in an argument. You may find yourself holding onto good pieces of analysis that you want to shoehorn into your argument but they ultimately don't work. Be agnostic about your own process--don't force in evidence/paragraphs/arguments, however good, if they don't follow your main point. Concision, succinctness, and strength of argument are the main things of import. Everything else, including your command of vocabulary, your knowledge of other texts, and even your formatting to an extent are secondary to your logic and how well you convey them.

Also, yes, use MLA. 1'' margins, double-spaced, 12pt TNR, number your pages, proper in-line citations.",15,,False,eq062pe,False,False,1559678849.0,2019-06-04 15:07:29

Cause I can't post this on Facebook...,throwawayh22,"I know exactly what you're going through. As a senior, it's a realization that I've seen many people around me stumble upon. Harvard isn't a ticket to success, and you will need to work very hard here to get what you want. The kids going to Goldman/MS/JPM/etc, in most cases, arrived here wanting to go into banking/trading and did the necessary prep and networking to get there. Same goes for prestigious software companies or top consulting. People seriously underestimate the difficulty of getting these internships and joke about high finance/MBB consulting/FAANG as if those companies are begging you to work for them. 

This belief in the power of the Harvard degree ends up hurting a lot of freshman and sophomores who realize too late during junior year that many doors close if you don't have the right GPA, ECs, previous internships, or simply if you started too late (like finance recruits over a year in advance now I think). And unfortunately, those who figure this out too late are all too often students who come from families and backgrounds not exposed to this stuff. I get it man. It sucks, and I had to go through this. 

At the end of the day, you are, as a Harvard student, in a better position than kids from most universities. If you are still trying to find an internship for this summer, keep applying around, but be aware that most job portals are black boles. Have a good cover letter template that will allow you to to get those apps submitted as efficiently as possible. Consult with OCS and your peers if you think your resume is not the best it could be. 

To maximize chances for work this summer:

1) Use linkedin and the alumni directory to find Harvard alums, especially those in your hometown, who might have an opportunity, even an unpaid one. Connections are the single easiest ways to get internships, and many Harvard alums are very generous.

2) Consider trying to find a research opportunity with a professor here. You didn't specify your concentration, but if it's anything in the sciences, you can very easily contact a couple professors and organize something for this summer. Funding can come from HCRP. Even if you aren't in the sciences, you can still find research positions in the social sciences or elsewhere. Doing this is much better than doing nothing. Professors won't vet you like companies will.

I was in your boat, ended up doing research with a professor, then worked my ass off to pull my GPA. I'll be heading to a mid tier consulting firm (one tier below MBB) after graduation, so things didn't work out so bad. You've got this.",10,,False,ehso9ea,False,False,1551735810.0,2019-03-04 15:43:30

I'd be willing to bet that a lot of those people interning at Goldman or wherever had some kind of hook or had been building up to it for a while. Harvard will open doors but it's not an all access pass.

I would say since it's your first internship shoot for a start-up or somewhere less known but that will really give you a chance to learn.

According to their policy, any scholarships beyond the student contribution (besides up to $2k for a laptop freshman year) will reduce your Harvard grant 1:1.

In a case with no outside scholarships, Harvard seems to usually expect the student contribution to be used for unbilled expenses (plane ticket, etc). The scholarships will replace the student contribution, so in theory you should be able to use the money as you would the student contribution. 

In my case, I have a small tuition bill remaining even after financial aid. I’m going to apply all my scholarship money towards the tuition, and will simply be frugal with living expenses.

"Harvard's decision on ""unrecognized single-gender social organizations"" (USGSOs), including final clubs",gdavtor,"I'm not entirely on Faust's side about final clubs, but she did have some good points in her letter. 

What a lot of people don't know was that there was a similar debate about 100 years ago at Harvard. At that time, many faculty and leadership in the university thought that Harvard was becoming too much of a ""rich kids club,"" as the socioeconomic barriers became very pronounced at the College. This is the main reason the Barker Center was built originally. It was meant to be an affordable eating club/dorm for students of lesser means. The Houses were even conceived partially because the College wanted all students to live in an academically-tied house as a response to increasing student apathy towards academics. All of the issues of class division and academic apathy seemed to stem from the exclusive social scene. 

From this perspective, I definitely agree that Final Clubs are contributing to a campus that is less focused on academics and more on social status. This isn't a new problem in Harvard's history. To me, it is today's incarnation of what was happening 100 years ago. I don't like Faust's language of ""diversity"" and ""inclusiveness"" because it has so many nasty connotations from far Left college groups (like Evergreen State College fiasco). However, I do believe that she is right to point out a problem and attempt a gradual solution.",11,,False,dqtp3xq,False,False,1512514592.0,2017-12-05 16:56:32

In fact, the department is remarkably good at training students with very little advanced math background and turning them into some of the best math graduates in the country.

"Cross-admits w/ Yale or Princeton (or similar schools), why did you choose Harvard?",gdavtor,"I chose Harvard over Princeton. I mainly did so because I felt like the culture at Harvard fit my personality better. When you're talking about HYP+, there are very few differences academically (at least for undergrad), so usually the decision comes down to how well you feel that you fit in.

I can say this: the English department at Harvard is truly fantastic. It is one of the best concentrations here. I am not an English major, so I don't know first hand, but everyone says that Harvard's English department is best of the best. It's also super friendly and small. I also probably don't need to remind you that the Crimson is one of the best (if not the best) college newspapers to write for. 

With regards to your questions: no, I would not have chosen differently. I am very happy with my experience here. That said, I probably would have been very happy at Princeton too. Some things I don't like are  that the housing is hit-or-miss (some of it is great, some not so great). However, the university is in the process of renovating all of the Houses, so this might not affect you. 

Harvard has a really great community and has lots of very unique traditions that you won't find elsewhere. For example, one of the main reasons I came here was because of the Housing system.

"Students of physics, I summon you",SampleMeerkat,"Hello fellow physics enthusiast! 

I'm not sure I fully understand your specific question(s), but I'll give it a go. 

I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student studying physics at Harvard. On that note, I know there are PLENTY of ways for undergrads to get involved with research and tour labs here at Harvard. Even just emailing a professor (or grad student) of a group you're interested in and asking for a tour/to meet up and chat is an effective way to get answers to your questions.  It sounds intimidating, but in general we're so happy to share our knowledge and experience since few people actually choose physics. So when we find interested people we try not to scare them away. 

Masters vs PhD. In the States, not many people apply for and get just a Masters degree. Usually it is a step along the way to a PhD that you get for completing courses at the graduate level. Sometimes (I'm not sure how often, I've heard for all PhD programs across all subjects the number is as high as 50%) people will drop out of the PhD, but stick around long enough for the master's just to kind of get something for the time. If you are in a master's program, generally you are paying tuition - I'm not actually sure about income though. For a PhD at almost every school the school will pay your tuition and give you a livable stipend. The trope about 'struggling grad student' is an exaggeration in most cases, depending on your spending habits. But the income is certainly less than if you took your BSc straight to an industry job. But keep in mind you are also getting 'paid' in the form of tuition coverage and, at the end of it all, a degree.

In other countries (specifically Canada where I got a Masters) there was a research component + thesis, and I got paid a livable wage and tuition paid for. 

Since you are a freshman, I don't think you are limiting yourself by doing physics at all. Physics is so broad that if you find a particular love for computer science (for example, or bio physics, or astro, or even wall street risk assessment) you can tailor your degree to include more of those courses. Then near the end of your degree you can decide if you want to focus on making a portfolio and not do a PhD, or continue in academia. My friend from undergrad ended up doing this - and when I met him in first year he was dead set on a PhD. That's kind of the beautiful thing about undergrad, you can take a range of courses and the find the fit the works for you and you are excited by. 

Feel free to ask more questions, or ask for clarification. 
Also, if you're at Harvard currently, we could meet for coffee and chat!",3,,False,f2m0b2z,False,False,1570300101.0,2019-10-05 13:28:21

I will be on campus during finals, around Dec. 17th. Maybe we can plan something when that time nears, I’m sure you have some pretty thorough knowledge in these regards.

Basically, my stance is - if I need a PhD. to get my dream job in academia, I will get it done. The length of schooling does not intimidate me. I will be doing what I love, how can I complain?

What troubles me - I do not wish to come out with my PhD. and not find any jobs in academia (exactly what I spent six years of my life earning that degree to achieve). I do not want a PhD, find zero academic careers, and wind up becoming an engineer, analyst, risk management, etc. I would be extremely overqualified and doing things for the sake of helping businesses succeed. If I wanted to become one of those, I would’ve majored in that instead and I would’ve been saving a ton of student expenses as well. I don’t want to help some sociopathic CEO with his greedy agenda, I want to contribute to our knowledge of the world, scientific and technological advances and such.

I also think it's wrong to say that you would be 'overqualified' anywhere outside of academia.

1. Do you have a better chance of becoming a professor *at Harvard* if you have a Ph.D. from Harvard.
2. Do you have a better chance of becoming a professor *anywhere* if you have a Ph.D. from Harvard.

The answer to #1 depends a bit on what you mean by ""professor."" If you mean a tenured professor, the answer historically is No. In fact, the reverse is true: Harvard traditionally likes to hire faculty who have spent part of their academic careers elsewhere. (In contrast to MIT, which likes to hire and promote its own PhDs.)

The answer to #2, is not necessarily. It turns out that when a department is considering hiring a recent Ph.D. graduate, what matters is not the overall reputation of the university where they went to grad school, but the reputation of the *specific department* they came from and the *specific professor* who was their thesis advisor. For example, if you want to get a Ph.D. in Polymer Science, Case-Western is apparently the top-rated department in the country. For Philosophy, Boston College is rated higher than Harvard.

So the best thing to do if you want to get a Ph.D. is to find the program that's the best fit for your interest.

Nope. Track record of what you've done will get you a tenure position.

Anyone going for/became a professor after grad school here? Do I have a higher chance of actually getting a job as a professor if I get a phD here?,,"Honestly no one can answer that question. I know for a very solid reason.

PhD is just not enough for you to get tenure position or faculty position, as you already know you need a solid and good amount of work in the field to be able to be considered for the position.

PhD is generally followed by the post doc for some years and then you might be able to start interviewing for faculty position.

Backgrounds are so varied that there’s no typical one. People had every major. Some were straight out of college, some had been consultants or soldiers or rabbis or charity founders or paralegals. Most were impressive and fascinating.

Your GPA and LSAT will matter a lot. A low LSAT or GPA is not insurmountable, as HLS is large and Admissions really does look beyond the numbers, but you will need something compelling in your application to stand out if so. Having the right numbers is a very good sign that you will be accepted, unless something in your personal statement or LORs makes admissions wary. 

Average LSAT and GPA numbers are available on HLS's 509 forms, and for more information generally on the law school admission process the sidebar and sticky of /r/lawschooladmissions should be your go to.

The majority of students have at least a year of work experience out of college. Not all, but most. 

I am near the end of my time at HLS and have thoroughly loved it. In addition to /u/Wrkncacnter112's points, I've loved going to a ""big"" law school because it supports so much more in terms of activities. I did not come in expecting to love it, but I have made lifelong friends with truly incredible people.

New Harvard president Lawrence Bacow promises a more outward-looking university,miamiedge,"In April of last year, Harvard's president held a meeting at the Economic Club in Washington, D.C. to fret about losing the hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding Harvard gets each year. Rather than dissipating, the concern is reaching a fevered pitch behind the scenes.

The Trump administration's preference is not secret. The proposed federal budget for 2018 called for slashing federal funding for scientific research and education, elite universities which declared themselves ""sanctuary campuses"" faced repeated attempts at withholding funding for opposing federal immigration law, the Department of Justice backed an anti-asian discrimination lawsuits which if successful would prove a violation of federal law and take away funding, and lastly the president himself is quick to threaten it, as with this tweet  towards UC Berkeley's protests against a right-wing provocateur (Milo) visiting:

*"" If U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?""*

Of course the government has to prove a violation of federal law to withholding funding from a specific university. And the UCali president was quick to support Milo's right to speak against the wishes of liberal students and faculty who don't quite understand there's something more important than moral showboating (money).

All this comes to the third pillar - the public. A populist president can be moved by popular opinion (as he was vis-a-vis the separation of families controversy). But a history of elitism holds them back at the gate, and recent revelations of racial discrimination in admissions and (more damaging) large preferences for legacies, the wealthy, and the well-connected pushes them further back still. If you polled voters today with a loaded question: ""Should the extremely wealthy Harvard get $500-600M a year of your taxpayer dollars?"" The results would be worse than perhaps any other time in Harvard's history.",4,,1530830216.0,e1uwyp8,False,False,1530829657.0,2018-07-05 17:27:37

Public defenders are grossly understaffed and underpaid. The local effect of incentives being set up the way they are is that people do what is best for them and their family, economically. The nationwide effect is that people who need legal representation just have to make do with what they get. Criminal defendants seldom have much political pull, so who in our government is going to stick up for them?",5,,False,dp2ncn5,False,False,1509324760.0,2017-10-29 19:52:40

"Justice Department has ""ongoing investigation"" into Harvard admissions practice, according to Sept. 29 DOJ letter",Dkennemo,"I mean, as long as affirmative action in all its forms has been around (whether you want to call it holistic admissions or what have you), it's attracted controversy and will continue to do so because there just isn't a way to easily level the playing field that has favored white males from time immemorial.  And since the equal protection clause of the US Constitution means at any given time what the nine US Supreme Court justices say it means, then as administrations change, affirmative action will come under greater or lesser scrutiny. It is unavoidable when you're talking about massive resource allocation.

To the extent this debate involves Harvard in particular, it's only because it's really prominent on the national scene; ultimately the difference in value to society whether people attend one university versus their next best alternative, is small. Because - think about all the people who get rejected from Harvard who feel they would have gotten accepted had it not been for affirmative action - what's their next best alternative? Let's say they wind up at Boston College. Now assume some value delta of going to Harvard vs Boston College (hard to do, I know, but just roll with it...) Now sum up whatever that value is for all those people. We're talking about a hill of beans if the scale is against whatever the United States government should be spending its time doing. Is this worth allocating loads of government resources to chase THIS down, versus all the other challenges they have to face?

It's not. There's no way to argue it's even remotely worthwhile unless you want to pin it on a ""fairness"" argument, and then it devolves quickly because fairness is one of those suitcase-like terms that means many different things to different people.",2,,False,dofmczl,False,False,1508136444.0,2017-10-16 01:47:24
"Justice Department has ""ongoing investigation"" into Harvard admissions practice, according to Sept. 29 DOJ letter",JanetYellensFuckboy,"Late night Reddit study break for you too eh?

All joking aside, I 100% agree with you that this is a staggering waste of government resources. Bigly.

I don't even see the Constitution being relevant here given the fact that we're a private university. ""We can do whatever the fuck we want"" seems like it would be an inaccurate statement, but, honestly, I don't think it's far from the truth. (And over here in the other corner, we have Liberty University [sic], which somehow maintains accreditation while teaching young-earth creationism instead of basic science classes!)

Ignoring the whole Constitutional jurisdiction thing--and maybe the Equal Protection Clause *is* at the heart of the issue here, because God knows it's a stretch anyway--*Fisher v. University of Texas* was decided *just last year*, and that was a decisive victory upholding affirmative action in public universities. I'm no HLS student, but I highly doubt affirmative action will be put on the docket anytime soon.

Talk about *stare decisis*...*Fisher* was decided barely more than a year ago for fuck's sake! The wastefulness of Trump and his administration is disgusting. I wonder if Sessions is truly this ignorant or if he's consciously draining taxpayer money to throw Republican voters a white bone.

"Justice Department has ""ongoing investigation"" into Harvard admissions practice, according to Sept. 29 DOJ letter",Dkennemo,"You would *think* stare decisis would apply, but it's gone to the US Supreme Court over the years. Everyone thought it was decided in Bakke, actually, in the late 90s.

The key is that none of the affirmative action Supreme Court precedents is a blank check - specific guidance has been given as to what is a permissible affirmative action strategy vs what is not. The Feds could always be investigating to see, for example, if the way admissions is administered at Harvard adheres to those precedents, for example.

Even when not directly involved in a case like this, Harvard has in the past provided amicus briefs (translates to ""friend of the court"") in which they've suggested legal analysis. While amicus briefs aren't often used, Harvard's were deemed of high quality and informed the court's decision in several cases. The reason Harvard did this, of course, is because if a bad precedent gets set through one case not involving Harvard, that could impact Harvard down the road when someone, seeing the outcome of that case, decides to litigate. 

Edit: BY THE WAY, it's not quite true that you can discriminate however you want just by virtue of being private - if you're a university that receives material resources from the government (think: student loans) - then Constitutional requirements pertain.",2,,False,dofzl7u,False,False,1508164631.0,2017-10-16 09:37:11

Bollinger, and Fisher v. University of Texas all have reaffirmed and furthermore refined the practice of affirmative action, so what legal question could possibly bring the issue before the SCOTUS again? Fisher didn't even directly revisit the constitutionality of the subject.

I'll be frank and get political: it's a stupid hot-button topic because a lot of people cannot wrap their heads around why their middle-upper class educated kid has less a chance of getting into any university than a kid with the same SAT scores from, to use an extreme, some underfunded school in the ghetto, and why such a policy directly aligns university's interest of diversity. I'd bet anything they've never heard of *ceteris paribus* in their lives. People vehemently against aa are either simpletons, narcissists, devoid of empathy, or some combination of the three.

Harvard Extension School-Bad Rep?,ruthplace,"All the talk of a bad reputation should really be more precise. I don't believe and have not experieced that it has a bad reputation. I believe if everyone is honest, the question everyone is really addressing is whether or not an extension degree is the same as a Harvard college degree. It isn't. With respect to the undergrad degree, however, there was a time a few years ago, perhaps still, when one could probably have taken all Harvard College courses to complete their Extension school bachelor's degree.  I never counted them all and cannot swear to this, and don't know about today, but it is an interesting thought. One certainly could take many HC courses.
But to the question of bad reputation, I ask, compared to what?
As I was working on my ALM I often came across discussions in which posters were trying to find out the graduation rate. We never did find out, but I am graduating in May, so it happens. The extension school programs are excellent. Be prepared to work. By the way, CS50 is both excellent, and a Harvard college course.
As an extension student, one does not have to have an excellent prior academic background. Do not make the same mistake as the earlier poster and conclude that this proves that extension students must not have those excellent backgrounds. Some definitely do. There are many reasons that a person with exceptional abilities might not have attended an ivy. Many older stduents appreciate the opportunity now to study with some of the best academics,  enjoy the rigor, and yes, don't mind that the Harvard name is attached.
It's such an odd discussion. At Oxford there are claases of degrees. There are a few part time advanced degree programs and even a small number of online master's degrees. They are simply called oxford degrees.
Anyway,  for me the program was convenient, inexpensive, the best online presentation at the time...back when online programs were mostly text in a bulletin board, rigorous, up to date, and relevant. But everone has different needs.

Deeper Ties to Corporate Cash for Doubtful Climate Researcher from Havard - We Hock Soon,xiipaoc,"> Money in itself IS bad, ever hear of conflict of interest?

To start with, all scientists get paid.  Theoretically, there's no conflict of interest in science, because science should stand on its own merits -- there should be evidence for any claims.  In fact, this conflict of interest accusation is often leveled against *mainstream* climate scientists to allege that climate change is a hoax perpetrated in search of scientific funding, which is a serious climate concern due to the amount of methane given off by that pile of bullshit.  Your personal opinion shouldn't be involved in determining whether the evidence supports a claim or not, and funding can't buy facts, just research.  Obviously you'll only choose to do research you're interested in and believe in, but receiving money from groups doesn't automatically make your science unscientific.  If it did, we'd be in a lot of trouble.

(Obviously, ethical rules about disclosure and such still need to be followed.  I'm not excusing the guy's actions.)

You might be thinking of civil officials, for whom conflict of interest is indeed possible.  If you're legislating about, say, oil companies and are a major stockholder in a particular oil company, you have a conflict of interest because what is best for your constituents doesn't necessarily agree with what's best for yourself.  If you're a judge, you will be pressured not to rule against this particular company, since doing so would mean you lose a lot of money.  That's a conflict of interest.  But when you're doing scientific research, at least if you're doing it honestly -- which I realize there's an incentive not to do if you're getting paid -- it's not a conflict of interest, just a breach of ethics.",2,,False,cou0hvg,False,False,1424657112.0,2015-02-22 20:05:12

Class of 2023 Survey,thelonelycerebellum,"The “prefer not to say” option doesn’t make much sense to me for an anonymous survey, and I think it is misleading because it’s biased in one direction (wealthy students). There’s a lot of first gen/low-income pride on campus, so I don’t think those students would necessarily be ashamed to report themselves as such, but I know quite a few students from wealthier families that are really uneasy talking about money. My guess is they’re the ones choosing “prefer not to say”. This is just my hunch, so I could be wrong. 

It’s also interesting how the article says “Harvard is predominantly white, straight, wealthy, etc.” without acknowledging Harvard is actually less white than it would be if races were represented proportionally (in the U.S.) and more queer as well.

Is LS50 worth is as a non-premed?,PhantomJellyFish,"I did not take a class but I was good friends with two people who did. If you are interested in STEM research, I would definitely recommend the course, but with caution. They teach you a TON of material which means you will gain a huge body of knowledge on biology and chemistry. In non-corona times, they spend so much time perfecting their lab technique that you will be way ahead of your peers in the rest of the STEM department. Obviously during online classes a lot of value is lost from this course.

The training you receive in this course will prepare you to succeed in any STEM profession both practical and theoretical. The course will also prepare you for some of the most difficult courses at Harvard, because the work ethic required to succeed in LS50 is NO JOKE.

This brings me to the huge con of taking LS50 which is that it is all consuming. This course will define your freshman year and honestly yourself to an extent. You will always be working on the course, and will not be able to give a lot of time to much else. 

There is a huge pro which arises from this con, however. You will become thick as thieves with your classmates. Because it is a small class size and the problem sets are so difficult and time consuming, you will be constantly working with your peers in order to succeed. You will come out of that class experience with a solid community of life science experts who have shared a struggle with you. 

If you love a challenge, you are extremely committed to a future in STEM, and are prepared to work your butt off and dedicate your time fully to this course, then by all means take it.",11,,1597035097.0,g0yon7a,False,False,1597033401.0,2020-08-09 23:23:21

As a bonus, two pieces of general advice:

* The best place to hear what past students think of a course is https://qreports.fas.harvard.edu, not Reddit 

* Before you start a career in bio research, think carefully about whether you're willing to spend your time maiming and killing mice (or rats or chinchillas or axolotls or zebra finches or zebrafish) because if you don't talk about this with your mentors in advance, you will more likely than not end up in a situation where your project suddenly requires it and you'll feel like you can't back out or pass it off to someone else, even if you're not ethically comfortable with it.",3,,False,g0zid3i,False,False,1597061180.0,2020-08-10 07:06:20
Is LS50 worth is as a non-premed?,crimsonthrowawayacct,"More or less, you have 4 intro chembio options:

LS1a/1b

LPSa

PS 10

LS 50

LS1a/tb is the most bio-focused of them. Great for that, 1b is a solid intro to genetics (though OEB 50 also is good). Not as heavy on the chem side

LPS is the intro class if you want more a chem spin on things/ not just pure bio. Harder than LS1, from what I hear.

PS 10 is the hard version of chemistry, you basically learn quantum mechanics and other fun things. You need calculus for this one, and it's a lot. Still, a great class, and I highly recommend it - this is the one that gives you the most rigorous foundation in chemistry. Given that you aren't specifically thinking medschool, this is the one I'd recommend, if you can handle it.

LS50 is a lot. Definitely more work than an LPS or an LS1, not sure how it compares vs PS 10 - I think they're just different types of difficult. It'll give you a lot of breadth, more than other classes, but not as much depth as PS 10. Another thing to know is it's all-or-nothing for course credit: if you take one semester and then drop, you don't get any Gened/degree credit .

There are also other intro PS classes (PS 1, PS 11) that are offered in the spring, but that I have heard are good. They aren't as challenging as PS 10.

If you're interested in building a strong base in chemistry/Chemical&Physical Biology, PS10->Chem 20/Chem30 (Organic Chem) -> Chem 40(Inorganic Chem) is the fastest path to take.

Is LS50 worth is as a non-premed?,nekatydaerlas1,"Others have basically hit on all main points but yeah, take a look at Q Guide comments for the most thorough sense of opinions. I'm a non pre-med ""bio person"" and found the class utterly transformed how I approach science in general, and set me up with the theoretical background and mindset to better think about everything I've encountered since then in biology. The class practically destroyed me, especially fall semester - time, stress, sleep, and compounding effects thereon - but I think it was more than worth it in the end. 

Learning things like statistical mechanics or dynamical systems in the biological context and in this course generally won't equip you to feel as if you'd taken a dedicated course on them and apply them immediately to your work, but when you encounter these things in research presentations from grad students/postdocs, or your classes later on, you've seen them before and have an intuitive sense of why they are used, and are unafraid to question. This is one of the main ""soft"" things I gained from this course. 

As to who it's ""meant"" for, I had several friends in the course who came in thinking themselves ""bio people"" and were excited enough by the physics/math/computational aspects of the course that they went to focus on those.

The name of Harvard will no doubt open up some doors that a local university offering a similar degree will not have, but depending on what you want to do that local university may be much cheaper and may serve its purpose for your aspirations. 

The questions you should be asking yourself are -

2. Will this degree help me become the professional I want to be?
3. Will this degree take me where I want to be as a professional?

Most of my classes in junior and senior year had fewer than 10 people, some classes were four people or fewer as well.

If you put in the effort, you can really have close connections with both TAs and the professors. This isn't a unique feature of Harvard but it's more likely that some of the big people in the field you're interested in will be teaching at Harvard. Additionally, I found some close mentors in a field completely unrelated from my degree, and really enjoyed branching out into the liberal arts education that Harvard does well.

It's difficult and you won't always be happy (it's really not for everyone), but I am very grateful for the wealth of experiences I had.

"Are people happy at Harvard for undergrad? Sounds like there are big classes and lots of classes taught by TAs. What is the appeal beyond the prestige? Not being snarky, really want to know your why you like it.",xiipaoc,"I graduated... a while ago, so I don't know how things are right now, but yeah, there are some big classes... and you can take small ones instead if you'd prefer.  Introductory lecture classes are almost always pretty big and almost always taught by the professor, and then you'll have smaller sections once a week with the TF, and that's when the actual discussion happens.  There *are* some classes taught by TF's, but at least when I was there, that was limited mostly to basic math courses like multivariable calculus and linear algebra, probably because it would be silly to have a 300-person lecture for math classes and sillier still to have it be taught by a professor when pretty much all questions can be answered by undergrads anyway (I was a Course Assistant for these courses one year).

Anyway, the appeal is that everyone is very, very smart, so the work you'll be doing is very, very difficult (well, not in the basic math classes, but you don't go to Harvard because of the *basic* math).  Even in classes taught by TF's, the professor is the one who actually makes the assignments.  And you generally have the option of taking something harder and deeper if you want.  Don't want to take the basic math courses?  Take the advanced ones.  Or the honors one.  Or the advanced honors one (look up Math 55).  You may want to only take that one if you're competitive at the international level.  Most schools don't have anything like that; you'll take the basic ones and be happy with them.  Equivalents exist in other fields, too.

I'm of the opinion that there are many schools where you could get an education fairly similar to the one you get at Harvard; Harvard is not unique.  But it *is* at the top when it comes to the qualifications of its students, and the courses are geared to the people who take them.  You'll be expected to do higher-caliber work at Harvard than at schools with less-academically-inclined students.

That said, many times I wished I'd gone to MIT instead because of its residential system; I'd have been so, so much more social.  Eh.",4,,False,fovfnms,False,False,1588100514.0,2020-04-28 14:01:54

By sophomore year I was in at least two courses taught directly by tenured professors who i still keep in touch with (and those were both outside my concentration).

If you’re smart about the courses you choose, you can absolutely get personalized attention.

After largely semi-fucking around my first two years at Harvard, junior year I woke the fuck up and realized I wasn't taking advantage of anything here.

You can completely skate by here and no one will notice.

And yeah, the challenging academic environment is a real trade off between pushing yourself, learning things quickly and rigorously, and unhealthy, relentless self comparison with people who are talented beyond belief. Personally, I've never been able to find ways to cope with this in a healthy way.

Luckily, in my experience, the pressure to go into consulting/finance was not a big deal.

Should I Take a Gap Year?,SoulCacher,"IMO, gap years are for traveling and exploring the world, or working to get a feel for how the world works.  Unfortunately, travel/economic disruptions are likely for at least the next 6 mo, maybe the next 12 or 24, and hamper plans for either of those.  Transversely, if you can’t go anywhere anyway, you might as well be cramming in the knowledge and putting that time toward your degree (on campus or off).

So, if it were me and I was considering a gap before COVID, or were on the fence, I’d think this would tilt the scales toward the “no gap” side.  If was already 100% certain I was taking a gap, I’d probably reconsider, lest I be stuck on my ass @ my parents place doing nothing for 6-12 more months.

Harvard MS in Data Science,smerity,"I was in the first year of Harvard's MS in Computational Science & Engineering a half decade ago, which likely has a great deal of overlap with the MS in Data Science, and it was still a tremendous and rewarding challenge for me.

My background was in computing so I had similar early reservations but the access to advanced courses you have will guaranteed give you the set of challenges you'd want. The reading group I was in gave me the most fascinating deep dive into distributed systems in an environment with only a dozen other competent students and an educator leading the field whilst also entirely aware of the shortcomings. The machine learning course and connections had me on the cutting edge of technology that would come to the fore in a few years time. I don't think you'll find any lack of challenges if that's your desire.

The goal for most students is entirely varied and up to the individual. I have seen it serve as a jumping board for all the options you pondered. None of my friends would have had an issue getting a job at any of the standard big firms so I wouldn't worry about that.

I was very lucky in gaining many of those stepping stones but my time at Harvard, both community and program, certainly provided many of those early stepping stones free.

For the history however: I went and did a brief stint with Common Crawl in the summer break during my Masters. They're a small non-profit with an active and engaged patron and represented the exact type of non-profit work I wanted to do in the data science community. After a while with them I applied to MetaMind (only applied to them as they had the specific startup + research opportunity I wanted) as I wanted to transition from dataset creation to machine learning again. MetaMind gave me an opportunity to move back into machine learning and eventually led to the Salesforce acquisition where I was able to focus on research entirely, specifically language modeling in deep learning. I left Salesforce Research after a few years for my own venture, TBA and hilariously more about discovering what I want to do than being an effective mode for any work ^_^

1. Fantastic commute time (<1 minute) to my building (Maxwell-Dworkin)
2. Don't need to clean your restroom. You do have a shared kitchen that is frequently occupied, and you do need to clean up after yourself.
3. Dorm mates are antisocial. Social events are infrequently offered, poorly attended and generally awkward.
4. The dining hall is atrocious. Unbelievably bad. It's on the other side of campus, meaning you'll need to walk 10-15 minutes one way. The hours are limited, they shut down early, they close for every holiday or university vacation. There are only a few dishes offered, and most dishes are horrible.

Questions for Economics Students,crimsonchin68,"— I graduated in the past few years with an ec concentration —

I liked taking economics a lot. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do coming out of high school (didn’t take any economics courses) so I took ec 10 with my friends and liked it well enough, so I kept taking the courses. Ec 10a/b (freshman year) and 1010a/b (sophomore year) suck because they’re boring, can be difficult and have actual p-sets. For those classes you’ll definitely want to have a good section leader, but even if you aren’t assigned to the “best” TF there is tons of latitude for you to simply attend other TF’s office hours/review sessions and even join their section in many cases.

I mention section for a few reasons: material is actually taught by your TF, especially in 10ab, and because the ec department let me switch around my TF more than any other class or department. Take advantage of it. 

David Laibson taught an undergrad level class (jointly with another professor, although I cant recall that professor’s name) on behavioral economics that was really fantastic. It was lottery-ed, however. Jeffery Miron also teaches a class on Libertarian economic principles that was both easy and interesting, since it steps away from the otherwise Keynesian material that is taught in the department.

TL;DR The ec department is pretty great and is relatively easy from a workload and content perspective. Take 10a if you’re at all considering economics - it can be a gen ed requirement even if you don’t take it past freshman year, which many students do.",8,,False,ee2w201,False,False,1547506235.0,2019-01-14 16:50:35

The class itself was worthwhile to people who understood the class. Glaeser is brilliant and is fantastic to talk to outside of class. However, in lecture he just becomes this lecturing monster that plows on and gets exponentially quicker as time passes.

Midterm was miserable. Final was even more miserable. Psets are meant to be done in collaboration and nobody was free when I was free to pset.

Questions for Economics Students,randomnese,"1011 is not quant, it's microeconomic theory. You rarely deal with actual numbers and most of your time is taking partial derivatives to get comparative statics rather than making predictions and call-puts. Quant would be Stat 123 with Stephen Blyth, which is built on a very solid foundation of expectation, conditional probability, and predictive models. 1011 has almost none of that.

&#x200B;

As for the other part of your question, I have no idea how 1010a is except for what my blockmate said.

Word of advice: Don't listen to the professor when he says that ec intuition/background is not necessary. It absolutely is necessary and your life will be miserable without it.
