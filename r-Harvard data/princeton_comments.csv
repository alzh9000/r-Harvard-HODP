U. renames Woodrow Wilson School and Wilson College,Guluronate,"1) How did you miss the massive campuswide discussions on Wilson's racial legacy that's been going on for the last five years? It's not like people in the campus community don't have informed opinions on this. [The school's own report on this issue came out four years ago](https://www.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2017/08/Wilson-Committee-Report-Final.pdf) (though many have justifiably criticized that this report is a pretty kid gloves treatment of Wilson, it still more or less gets the point across)

2) The guy's entire comment was the answer to ""If not, why the change?""- it's an equally valid question to ask why we should keep the name in the first place. A name is inconsequential at best and harmful at worst, and the action that mitigates harm the most is renaming things.

U. renames Woodrow Wilson School and Wilson College,Guluronate,"The ""cut'n'paste"" answer was simply me pointing out that the amount of writing and conversation around this issue has been so extensive for half a decade that the fact that you're not aware of it says more about your knowledge of the topic than it does about the comprehensiveness of the post you were responding to. Your ignorance on the conversations around Wilson's legacy is certainly not my fault, and there's no need for every conversation about how we'll deal with Wilson on campus to retread this ground, just like there's no need to re-teach students how to read when we ask them to analyze writing.

Regarding cost, I simply can't see this as a serious argument. I can't think of many, if any, actual physical references to Wilson's name on things around campus- even the lion statues that mark the entrance to what was Wilson College are labelled ""Class of 1879"", not with his name, and the building that houses the Public Policy institute is Robertson Hall, and I'm not aware of any physical references to his name here either. So, what then? Updating the websites? You can do that with simple copy-and-replaces. Printing fliers/paperwork? They get reprinted every year anyways. And if this is such a problem with renaming things, why didn't the report published by the committee dedicated to analyzing all of the issues around renaming things mention it at all? Most damning to this argument is the fact that the name of both Wilson College and academic buildings named after Wilson have \*already been changed before\*, which, again, you would know if you were actually familiar with the report. Obviously the cost was not a significant impediment the first time they changed the name.

Regarding your second point, this, again, has already been answered in the thread above you- we shouldn't shy away from criticizing historical figures, and none of them have an obligation to have their name put on anything. The rest of your argument is a ridiculous slippery slope fallacy- we have the freedom to critically analyze any historical figure, but that does not mean that we are obligated to do so, nor does it mean that our analysis has to come to the conclusion that we should remove references to their name. Furthermore, it also doesn't follow that removing references to their name is a \*bad idea\*, especially if a more critical analysis of their history and impact on our institutions wasn't actually positive. I would argue that if somebody had significant negative impact, we shouldn't want things named after them anyway.",7,,False,fwack4k,False,False,1593367981.0,2020-06-28 13:13:01

Math TA posted false solution online to catch students in violation of academic integrity,DoucheShepard,"The student quotes in this are pretty hilarious. Imagine getting caught cheating on your math homework and then trying to morally high road the person who caught you. The TA didn't do anything unsavory, they didn't suggest that people go look at cheat websites before posting a fake answer. If you weren't already looking to cheat this didn't affect you at all. Its like a bank robber complaining about marked money. The only thing I'm sympathetic to is exactly how long the punishment should be.

Apparently the trust between student and TA means they should let you cheat and be cool.

>“I don’t think a TA should ever do this, or ever take this power,” they said. “They don’t have that position … That’s the position of professors, teachers, COD, other people. A TA is not there to create whatever traps for students and allow this to happen, and it seriously affects the trust that students could have.”

Or how about ""Hey yeah we totally cheated, but they look at this asshole who caught us. I was just browsing Slader. I wasn't going to cheat until I saw that irresistible answer""

>One of the accused students who spoke to the ‘Prince’ said they were conflicted in their views on the situation. They noted that students “weren’t forced to go onto Slader,” but they also said that “two wrongs don’t make a right.”

April 4th: everyone receives email about not copying from online sources.

April 7th: everyone receives email that too many students are asking for extensions on the assignment.

Mid-April: trap solution is set.

It seems like the math department was well aware that students were having a really difficult time, and rather than evaluating the problem they decided to ignore it and then a TA took it upon themselves to set-up a gotcha operation. Once students were sent home, they all had to experience the course in very different environments. Math dept really could not have cared less. I actually think Slader is a really awesome resource for either checking your work or seeing the process of a solution to better understand how it's done. Using Slader like this falls within the rules stated in the syllabus that ""*You may check your computations using a calculator or any other technology while doing homework, but you must include most hand calculations in your written submission to receive full credit*"". But outright copying off of it is like abusing the site and not at all its intended purpose. Personally, I didn't have time to do the HW after everything went crazy, but I said fuck it didn't turn anything in and took the L. And although I feel like it's obvious that a fraction of 15% of your grade isn't worth getting caught cheating, some people might be so wrapped up in everything and overly anxious that they'd get desperate enough to copy work from Slader.

Given the full context, they seem like exactly what you’d expect, but imagine if you saw only those answers on Slader and you were trying to figure out why someone would post those in the first place. They’re not just wrong, they’ve clearly been deliberately written to resemble real answers if you’re not paying attention or don’t know what you’re doing, but are very quickly identifiable as bullshit if you have half an idea of what’s going on. 

It would have been easy to write an entrapment answer for a question with a numerical result, which there are plenty of in 202 psets. This was the harder way of doing it. The writer also could have written an answer that was partially correct but laced with some kind of dead giveaway, but they didn't, even though that also would have been easier. It looks like some amount of real thought went into the creation of those fake answers. 

Given that there are a small number of theorems to pick from for a given section, I’d probably wager the writer even went out of their way to check that the theorem they referenced had nothing to do with what they were writing.

They could try going to office hours/McGraw, using Piazza, and asking/emailing professors after lecture (my professor, at least, was always entirely eager to help with hw questions)...in short, accessing approved resources. Not everyone is expected to figure out every problem and there are resources available to address that which aren't cheating. 

Look, now is definitely a rough time and 202 is definitely a difficult class. I'd have much more sympathy if by ""looking it up"" the students were just ""getting inspired."" If you fully get the logic of a looked-up solution and then write a watertight explanation on the pset, then in my book that's acceptable. That's better understanding the material. I'm also sure the math department knows it could rarely prove that such an explanation wasn't the student's original idea. So partly because of that, and partly because these kinds of students wouldn't have used those blatantly fake Slader answers, I highly doubt any of them were reported.

Look at the Slader answer to question #23 in 8.1 - it's painfully wrong to anyone that bothered to try and understand it. ""The eigenvalues are orthogonal"": anyone that knows what orthogonality is (basic concept in chp 5) and what eigenvalues are (basic concept in chp 7) can see that this is plain nonsense. And the theorems mentioned are completely unrelated - 8.1.3 is about the number of real eigenvalues for symmetric matrices and 7.1.5 lists properties of invertible matrices. So what I gather is that anyone who used this answer (apparently the vast majority of students who responded to that GroupMe poll) either 1) Actually knows the material yet decides to blindly BS the hw or 2) Doesn't know the material and copies answers without attempting to process what they're writing or even checking the theorems, and probably also has no conception of the past four chapters at all and has been cheating this whole time.

However, Federal Civil Rights laws **do not** outlaw systemic racism.  So Princeton itself benefits from ""not being racist"" (per Civil Rights laws) while still actually getting to be ""systemically racist"".  It's a win-win for Princeton, since the goal of the university as a system is to maintain itself, i.e. it started out systemically racist and the institution's goal is to maintain itself as a systemically racist institution.

Of course you can see that by not outlawing systemic racism, U.S. Federal Civil Rights laws are, in and of themselves, systemically racist, since allowing the perpetuation of systemically racist organizations (including but not limited to, universities, city and state governments, law enforcement organizations and labor unions) is of course, not just systemically racist, but actually explicitly racist.  (Anything that is explicitly racist is as a matter of course systemically racist.)

Since the U.S. Civil Rights laws are explicitly racist, it follows that the organization that created the laws, the Federal Government itself, is also explicitly racist.

One of the magical thing about systemic racism is that it's the system that racist, not the people.  So politicians that run city governments, even Democrats, get co-opted by the system and become racist themselves, *even if they are POC*!  

Another magical thing is the politicians themselves can't be held responsible for the racist results of the systemically racist government.  They are powerless to change or reform the system.  The system *can't* be changed or reformed, it can only be ""burned to the ground"" (I'm speaking figuratively here of course!) and replaced by a non-systemically racist system.

This explains the calls to defund the police.  The goal is to eliminate police departments that are ipso facto systemically racist and replace this ""system"" with a new, non-systemically racist system.  That's why it is actually good (just to provide a real life example) that a female POC police chief was forced to resign in Seattle.

There is a problem though.  There is a fundamental principle in the US that governmental organizations only exist ""with the consent of the governed"".  I'm pretty sure this concept is considered systemically racist itself, though I haven't done the work to understand how.  But at any rate, there are too many citizens that believe in this illusion.  This leads us to the inescapable conclusions:

1. Society itself is systemically racist.  Otherwise it would not have produced institutions that are systemically racist.
2. Replacing systemically racist institutions cannot be done with the consent of the governed (since the governed are the source of the systemic racism) and the governed do not want them replaced.
3. Therefore, replacing systemically racist institutions can only be done though the use of force.  They must be imposed on a population that is not willing to do the work of replacing the systemically racist institutions itself.

With that explanation out of the way, I can tell you that there is actually one international organization that is **not** systemically racist. And while it does advocate for the simultaneous violent overthrow of all current governments on the planet to put an end to systemic racism once and for all (not to mention many other problems humans experience) under a single world government, it does know that this is only possible via the intervention of extra-terrestrial forces.  So that organization itself is not actually engaged in the process of violence itself, its members content to tell others about the inevitable coming change in world governance and advocating for everyone to support the incoming world government.",1,,False,g5qm1sr,False,False,1600460650.0,2020-09-18 15:24:10

Princeton: We are racist. / DOJ: You agreed not to be in order to get $75M in taxpayer money. Pay it back then.,Guluronate,"A few ways, off the top of my head:

1) Systemic racism that affects students' academic lives before they get to university- some students will have caregiving responsibilities or things affecting their lives that muddle our ability to accurately measure their academic potential. A brilliant student who spends all of their free time caring for sick relatives will test a lot different from one who has dedicated tutors hired to help them do well on tests. These factors affect students way before they get to Princeton

2) Systems that exist at Princeton that the university or even explicit perpetrators aren't aware of. Harvard's Project Implicit is one of the biggest ongoing psychology experiments in the world, and they've pretty consistently shown that most people have unconscious biases that lead them to prejudicing against certain groups. Making yourself aware of those biases is a good thing, because it helps you consciously overcome them- we should focus on growing out of these biases rather than condemning that they previously existed, since they're common societally

3) A lot of these systems come down to social dynamics or hierarchies of power that the university doesn't explicitly control. Students who feel like their opinions won't be taken seriously in class will be marginalized or pressured into not behaving like other students, even if the university doesn't actively tell them that their opinions aren't valid. This is why representation is so important to people- it gives people from historically marginalized groups a reason to believe that when they voice their opinions in an academic setting, people will actually pay attention. But the creation and maintenance of the environment that marginalized those people didn't require any actual actions by the university- it's much more environmental than that. In fact, these environments often persist in spite of organizations explicitly arguing that they support the voices of marginalized peoples- if somebody exists in a wider society that doesn't take your opinion seriously, I understand why that person would continue feeling that way when they move to a slightly different environment that's still a part of the society.

4) I think the definition of ""racist"" gets lost a lot here, mostly since that word is very charged. Racism isn't just overtly discriminatory acts, but also (as I alluded to above) systems that perpetuate discrimination in society. Identifying that parts of society perpetuate this racism isn't an indictment- it's necessary self-awareness that can direct us towards actually rectifying that discrimination. Systemic racism isn't always a set of overt actions that people do because they hate minorities or like oppressing people, so our response to it shouldn't be to condemn newfound self-awareness. Acknowledgement of racist structures is not racist, and since many of those structures were unconscious or part of wider societies, we should focus on how we can fix those structures and not on placing blame for them.

With the big caveat, of course, that overt racism does still exist. If the university openly knows that a practice is discriminatory and engages in it anyways with the intent of marginalizing certain groups of people, we shouldn't assume good faith. But as I understand it, nobody has accused Princeton of this sort of overt discrimination, so much as Princeton has acknowledged that the university exists within a society that has systemic discrimination in it.

It is typically used to refer to the racist outcomes that arise from systems or institutions that were designed without explicitly racist intent.

That makes more sense. However, I'm still of the opinion that funding should be withheld until whatever systemically racist policies the university has are changed. It is fully within the power and authority of the university officials to change their systems so that they are no longer racist.

Furthermore, just because something does not *intentionally* discriminate doesn't mean that there is no racial discrimination. To me it seems like you're saying that past intentional racial discrimination leads to current unintentional racial discrimination but the discrimination is there all the same.

That's pretty much all of them, even the ones that try not to. You could probably even drop the ""pretty much"". It is unclear to me how you could run anything remotely resembling a traditional selective admissions process at a US university without producing racist outcomes in some way.

> How would you interpret the letter?

The letter repeatedly framed systemic racism at Princeton as being intimately tied to and part of systemic racism as it exists in the fabric American society at large.

> for some reason you do not.

Nope! Absolutely incorrect. My objection is that the government doesn't seem to be trying to punish the university for taking insufficient action to remedy racist outcomes, but rather to punish the university for admitting it has a problem. This is clear from both the timing and the targeting of the government's announcement. But, in this case, admitting the existence of the problem is a necessary step towards taking meaningful action! How are you supposed to address a problem if you won't admit it exists?

If the government were to do a large-scale audit of universities and threaten to defund those that were not making sufficient progress on this point - great! (I mean, I'd have my qualms about the current administration doing it, given their general position on race-related issues, but even so, I don't believe they claim to have done that.) But that's not what's happening. Specifically targeting a university right after it makes a statement that says ""hey, we haven't done so well on this in the past, and we think we need to work on it"" - while not targeting other universities in similar situations that have _not_ made this statement - send the message that the intent is to punish the university for trying to change.

And, hey, Princeton can get by without this money, so I'm not super-concerned about what happens to Princeton specifically. I am concerned about the effect on institutions with smaller endowments, who might look at this and say ""hey, we better not rock the boat.""

Are students at Princeton happy?,lifeisfractal,"My first (because of the stress of adjusting to a new place) and last (because of my thesis/job search panic) semesters at Princeton weren’t great, but most of the time in between was awesome. I wouldn’t say that I fit in on campus in general - I’m black, went to a Title I high school/received a full Pell grant, and in general didn’t fit the preppy/upwardly mobile stereotype that was predominant in a lot of places on campus. I spent my first semester feeling really self-conscious about the fact that my clothes were all from discount stores, I’d never been to Europe, and my parents aren’t/don’t know anyone important.  However, I quickly got over that, because I absolutely loved my classes and I met a great group of friends. We all ended up signing into the same eating club and had an awesome time there. I graduated 8 years ago, but I’m still really close with my core group of college friends and see them all the time. 

The really unhappy people I saw at Princeton generally fell into two groups. One group had preexisting mental health issues that were exacerbated by the stress of being on campus, or they were really invested in entering the more “exclusive” segments of campus life (bicker eating clubs, dance groups, etc) and got worn down by rejection. Some people fell into both groups. 

I think the keys to being happy on campus - and honestly, probably just being happy in life) are: building/finding a community of people who like you for you, developing healthy coping mechanisms for stress/depression (aka going to see someone at the health center, exercising, getting enough sleep, talking to your friends etc), and filling your days with activities that you are inherently interested in, as opposed to things that you feel you need to do in order to impress people or check off a box on a to-do list.",32,,False,f2tfdp2,False,False,1570394239.0,2019-10-06 15:37:19

Be honest with you, over the course of my first two years here this place absolutely destroyed my mental and physical health.

the truth is this school is so intense that it’s difficult to make time for people unless it’s through activities. between practices/lifts and taking 5 classes I only have free time between 7:30pm (sometimes as late at 9) and midnight. that time gets spent studying.

> Nash, a West Virginia Native, shared a Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994, the year before he joined the Princeton mathematics department as a senior research mathematician.

> The last time many at Princeton saw Nash was in late March, when the university held a celebration following the announcement that he had won the Abel Prize with Nirenberg.

> &quot;The Abel Prize is top-level among mathematics prizes,&quot; Nash said in his soft voice at the event, according to an account written by the university&#039;s press office.

I make trips up to NYC to see my Columbia/NYU friends all the time, and spend the day.  I went near Philly (Camden) to see a concert.  Residential colleges here sponsor a ton of trips to NYC -- Broadway (tickets $25, includes bus food and orchestra seating), museums, day in the city, etc.  There's tons of opportunities to break the bubble, but it's nice to have a bubble to return to.

As for honest gripes... probably just with myself.  The university has so many opportunities and I'm passionate about a lot of things, so I take them and overload myself.  For instance, this weekend I developed two projects for HackPrinceton, am working on a startup for TigerLaunch (entrepreneurial competition) for Friday, am coordinating an all-Ivy consulting conference for a club I'm president of (join PBV! we consult for non profits and it's really cool) and have classes on top of that.

Wait, if president of Princeton has a weather machine that can generate or steer hurricanes... my god, the implications! Princeton would be a global superpower or at least regional player with that kind of ability! The orange bubble could be like the Vatican, but bigger and with even more dead language speakers per capita. Instead of mucking about with religious power, we'd have the direct ability to cause natural disaster and economic devastation. We already have more Olympic medalists, startups, academic developments and artistic works than many countries.

But wait! Sandy happened before we won the game! This implies Tilghman either has access to a Laplace demon (assuming a deterministic universe) or, given quantum mechanics, time travel, at least for information, which is all she needs to implement an Oracle machine and solve the Halting problem! P=NP! She could unravel all the world's encryption, and snoop on more mail and phone calls than the NSA. Truly, we'd be an even greater power than the meagre Vatican.

Grad Student Says Princeton Prof Who Sexually Harassed Her Was Given Slap On The Wrist,cartesiancategory,"Holy shit I see her every day in E-Quad. She's always laughing and smiling -- did not know this shit was going down. I sympathize with her, and I think we need to see more punishment for tenured professors who do despicable things. Just because their research is good does not mean that they have a moral fiber on par with the university's honor system, especially at a place like Princeton.

In general, I think we should be careful before just taking the words of people on faith, lest every accusation turn into a witch hunt like what is happening on the media right now, but here the evidence is overwhelming and it makes me fairly angry that the professor in question did not receive a significant suspension or public retribution for his disgusting actions towards someone half his age.

Personal update at 2:10 PM: Just in case people are worried for others they may know who are on campus, most people are going about their daily business at least on the southern/central part of campus. No one at Frist Gallery seems to be bothered by this news currently. 

Just another personal update at 5:22PM: At this point, most people don't really know much beyond the updates that are given in the link at the top of this comment. We aren't getting phone calls, texts, or email that are additional to what is being announced on the Princeton website at this point. In fact, we haven't gotten anything in that regards in a while.

Graduate School asked international students without a visa to defer,pton12,"The alternative is not doing the program. Given my experience as an F-1 student in the past and going through a few other interactions with USICS, I would recommend just filling out the deferral and hoping the visa clears so that she doesn’t have to use the deferral. She **cannot** study at an American university full-time without the proper authorization (I think there are some carve outs for short-term programs, but that isn’t she she is doing), otherwise she would be violation of immigration stuff and it may prevent her from getting a visa in the future or even being admitted into the country for some period of time (or permanently). This sounds hyperbolic, but US immigration doesn’t screw around. Princeton’s international student services (whatever it’s called) is pretty good and they always have the students’ best interests at heart.

I want to tell you that you came at a bad time just last weekend we had blue sky’s and warm weather(compared to the cold of winter) but if that rain was as bad as you make it to be then idk, because that’s maybe 1-5 times a month.  We have had an decreasing amount of snow with each passing year, so it’s mostly rain or dry. Honestly tho you mainly just came at a bad time considering the weather. 

The traffic on route one is highly situational, usually it’s relatively free and easy to move but occasionally it’s blocked still(for some reason it has a very high crash rate despite it only being a straight line. 

People wise, I’d say it’s a mixed boat. At the high school we’ve got everything from an overpopulation of nerds split between an overpopulation of entitled asshats. The town is very diverse with immigrants from all corners of the globe bringing traditions and ideals, as well as people who’ve lived in America for as long as their family can recall. I won’t say there aren’t asholes, I can name plenty including that one hybrid Toyota that cuts me off all the time, I know it’s the same one and drives super slowly. 

Nassau street is full of amazing restaurants and designer stores. If you’re looking for food check out Kung fu noodles, hoagie haven, or jammin crepes.  Hoagie haven though is a must with the Sanchez or the phat lady. Check out the town and the school despite the shorty weather, we all agree that the weather sucks, but at least it’s not cold anymore. While in new jersey try some wawa as well, I can assure you that you’ll be going there more than once if you end up going here. 

Anyway, what I’m trying to say is that the weather isn’t actually what the town usually looks like but it can be worse than that, there are many new and old restaurants that are addictive and all the stores are overpriced, but it’s up to you what to decide and prioritize.

"Got accepted to a PhD program at Princeton, how likely is it for incoming grads to get an apartment?",semperuirens,"All grad students are assigned priority based on their year for the room draw. First and second years have highest, but some years there are just too many people that want a certain room type and not everyone can get them get them. I'm going to give you a few more thoughts though, because the housing decision does make a pretty big impact on your experience.

Something to think about is what your relationship with campus is going to be. You can renew your apartment once before needing to re-enter the  room draw. If you need to be on campus every weekday for three years, it might be better to take the grad college for a year and then move into an apartment for the second and third year before moving a little further away, be it Philly, new York, or just Lawrenceville. That being said, the GC is pretty cool but it is definitely a dorm and does get to you sometimes.

Also, Lakeside is pretty cool and has tons of benefits (parking garage in the winter and summer is awesome) but it's so goddamn expensive to have a one room apartment. A lot of people do the GC bc it's a bit cheaper and they can find some friends to try to get some cheaper housing with (4 bedroom in lakeside is like 800 something each compared to like 1300ish for the single. Those walk through doubles in OGC are dirt cheap and sometimes the other room doesn't even get filled bc people don't want them as much as the singles. One thing in favor of the GC: camaraderie. Grad students tend to be down to earth and friendly and aren't shy about sitting down next to you at dinner or talking at social hour those first couple months. Yeah it sucks, but everyone knows it sucks and you go through it together. This is also one of the easiest and best ways to make friends outside of your cohort/department which you will definitely want. There are also two group kitchens which are serviceable if not ideal. They have lockers in there that you can get issued to keep cooking supplies in.

One other thing: Shopping in Princeton is hard and don't let anyone tell you differently. Most affordable stores are off the 1 and there is a bus but it really sucks to get groceries every week on a bus. Lots of people get cars if they don't have them already. So quite a number of people just live off campus from day one so they can keep their apartment as long as they need without the element of chance with the room draw, get away from the University vibe, and get more bang for their buck with housing. The grad student parking pass is free whether it's a housing-assigned one or the commuter one. None of the lots are suuuper close to the core of campus so you'll likely need to walk, bike, or bus to some degree anyway. The commuter lot might be the closest for walking and is across from Lakeside if you wanted to take the bus from there (but it's not a long walk). Also, if you're in plasma ask some plasma people specifically because having classes on campus and working at pppl is a whole different ballgame

From my cohort, 2 did the GC then lakeside, 2 did Lawrence from the start (not sure after that), 1 did the annexes, 2 got apartments off Nassau, and 2 got apartments further away and commute in ten to fifteen minutes.

"Got accepted to a PhD program at Princeton, how likely is it for incoming grads to get an apartment?",ladylouberry,"If you are coming in as a student with a domestic partner, spouse, or child, you have better chances of getting an apartment in Lakeside or Lawrence (because you can’t live in GC when you have family living with you, and they want people to have an option to live on campus their first few years). That’s how I ended up getting my apartment as an incoming first-year.

Otherwise, your best bet is to either find students during your visit who need to pull someone into their apartment for the next year, or say in your housing application that you’re okay with being put in an apartment with randomly assigned housemates. That being said, I know a few people in Lawrence who got single apartments their first year, so sometimes it just comes down to luck.

"Got accepted to a PhD program at Princeton, how likely is it for incoming grads to get an apartment?",semperuirens,"Sorry I'm getting back to you so late. I guess it depends how consistent your travel is and your program requirements. Also I'm assuming you only want to have one apartment. If you're planning on being on campus for five whole days out of the week, it probably makes sense to live in or around Princeton. The train is fine, but why pay for it more often than you have to? why spend more hours a week on it than you have to? Depending on your program, the first two years are likely the hardest because there are so many moving parts between classwork, prelims?, and generals, all on top of making friends and trying to get used to a new area. You can always move if you get a more relaxed two day a week schedule. 

&#x200B;

If you really don't want to live IN Princeton, you can always just live somewhere nearby and commute ten or twenty minutes by bus, train, or car. One version of this could be to live somewhere near the train like Princeton Junction, so it's even easier to get to the city on the weekend. Also, look into Jersey City: closer to the city, but south of the worst traffic on the train. I know a few Rutgers students who went this route. If you're thinking seriously about any regular commute, definitely look into the New Jersey Transit fares. Also remember that no matter where you live, a parking pass (where exactly the pass is issued for depends on what your living status is) will be free.

Congratulations to all the early action admits!,Kimba_the_White_Lion,"Everyone says the eating clubs are elitist, this is not entirely true.  There are 11 clubs at the moment, and 5 of them if you want to join, you are automatically in.  For the other 6, there is a selective process where if you want to join, you have to make a good impression on the members in the club and they need to pick you.  

Being in an eating club, you eat there.  You can still go there at night to party and you can be invited by friends to have meals.  Just because you aren't in an eating club doesn't mean you can't get into one for a dinner or a normal party night.  Only for the special nights do they shut the entire clubs down to members only.

As for partying in the clubs, some clubs require passes to which if you know an upperclassmen member of the club, then you can easily get your hands on as many passes as you like.

Social scene?  Everyone is friendly, everyone is in it together, everyone just wants to have fun.  Not everyone parties, but many people do and are safe and smart about it.  The key to a good social life though is being with friends.  I have a diverse group of friends and whether we're out partying, in studying, ice skating, or sleeping and cuddling, we always have a blast when doing stuff together.

Workload?  It's tough.  You made it in here, and Princeton makes you prove it.  That said, there isn't any competition between the students that I have seen (some people say premed students are competitive, but I haven't seen it in any discipline outside of that).  Therefore, just get a study group and make friends in your class and doing work will seem less like a chore and more fun.  Individual workloads vary from person to person so it is important not to overburden yourself with the classes you take or you'll be like me staying up until 4am every night doing work.

Fun things?  EVERYTHING!  Literally everything.  One thing I've noticed about Princeton is that they accept people who love life, love everything they do in life, and continually have fun in places they probably shouldn't have fun in.  This year Outdoor Action (which, if you decide to come, is the most awesome preorientation program ever) had probably the worst weather possible (7 straight days of thunderstorms) but somehow most groups made it though with a happy face (this, of course, after getting evacuated day 3 or day 4).  Extracurricular clubs are incredibly fun, intramural sports are a great way to release pent up energy, club sports are great ways to be a part of a team, and university sponsored events are loads of fun.  However, having fun always comes down to a single point, are you friends with the people you're around.  If you are, it won't matter what you're doing, you'll have fun doing it.  Heck, I didn't know pumpkin carving or baking could be so much fun until I'm in the kitchen trying to juggle eggs over a frying pan with all my friends cheering me on.  

I hope I answered most of your questions.  If you have anymore, please ask.  Other predditors, I implore you to add your answer for tiger2016.

Congratulations to all the early action admits!,guinness_blaine,"Kimba slightly misrepresented the situation with sign-in clubs - if you are signing in, you rank the sign-in clubs in order of preference (people bickering also do this as a backup).  If there are enough spots for everyone who ranked a particular club first, they all get in - if not, it gets a little more complicated.  In general, it's a random lottery to determine who gets in and who doesn't.  For one club (Charter), they keep track of how much interest people have expressed in the club (in the form of points given for attending certain special events), and the lottery is weighted by that system.

It's a little complicated, but by the time you're getting ready to join a club, everything will make more sense.

To address other things: if you come, do Outdoor Action.  Seriously, just do it.  I'm an OA leader because I think it's an awesome, worthwhile program.

I also highly recommend club sports - my team has had a large influence on my social life and just generally gives me a good way to relax with something that takes my mind off classes.

The most important thing you can do, since Princeton can be a pretty high-stress environment, is figure out what makes you happy, what makes you tick.

I think most people don't really care either way.  Most people who join a particular club will still end up hanging out at others from time to time.  Since you don't join a club until you're almost halfway through time at Princeton, it really doesn't make sense that she'd be miserable after not getting the perfect club - for one thing, she should be able to have a good time at some other sign-in club, but more importantly, by that point you already have your friends established.  If they're in a club and you aren't, they can get you passes and you can hang out anyway.  Not that big of a deal.  It does kindof hurt people's feelings if they get rejected from bicker, but most seem to get over it.

Prospective Chemistry PhD student,dr_philbert,"My two cents on this (please don't take this as truth): both Mo and Craig are highly respected researchers in the field. Mo does incredible work, but (from what I heard in the department) expects a lot from his students. I was only an undergrad in the department, but one of my friends worked in his lab and he called them in one time to say they weren't working hard enough. If he views his undergrad researchers like that, I can't imagine how he treats his graduate students. I think Princeton is a great little town, but I can't imagine a worse place to spend my time as a young adult. Most of my graduate student friends at Princeton were generally unhappy until they managed to move elsewhere and work remotely for their (e.g., physics/math students.) I feel like Baltimore would be a much better place to try and develop a life outside of graduate school if you think that'll be an important factor for you. Your work in either Craig's or Mo's lab will prepare you similarly, and they're both well-respected researchers so you won't have issues getting a position with a good rec from either of them. At this point, you have to weigh the differences in their research programs. I would recommend setting up a phone call with both of them to discuss some project ideas they have so you have a better sense of the work you might be doing in either group. Another factor, as I've mentioned before, should be thinking about how important life outside of graduate school will be to you. This mattered a lot to me, and it's why I didn't consider a few programs.

Also, you really should be careful to go to a school for only one professor. This is a common piece of advice given to prospective graduate students. Some heed it and some don't, and for those that don't, sometimes it doesn't matter. They got it right on the first try. I did not heed that advice and found myself in an awful situation when I realized I wasn't actually interested in my original choice but there were no alternatives for me at my school. Remember to look at everyone in those departments and think about what's exciting to you. Even if you did chem bio in your undergraduate research, you're not tied to it for your graduate studies. You can do whatever you want, even if you didn't specialize in it in undergraduate (provided you have at least some background in the subject enough to start the basic classes).",2,,False,fl5z6fa,False,False,1584849632.0,2020-03-21 23:00:32

Theoretical, organic, catalysis, etc.) while the Hopkins program opens up to the end school ( med chem, pharmacology, etc.).

What are the chances that NJ Transit will cause you to miss the Dinky?,phsics,"Useful analysis! However, I think that this split ticket recommendation might be oversimplified, and actually end up costing riders a bit each trip: 

> Based on our findings, if you’re in a tight squeeze or are a generally impatient person, you might want to consider buying tickets only to Princeton Junction on your next trip back to campus. This would allow you to delay the decision of taking the Dinky until when you get to the station and know whether you would actually be able to make it. That way, if you do end up electing to take an alternative form of transportation, you would save yourself a couple of bucks from the Dinky fare.

There is a price break when you buy a ticket for the Dinky that goes further than PNJ. For instance, a ticket Princeton to NY Penn costs 17.75, whereas buying separate tickets from Princeton to PNJ and then from PNJ to NY Penn costs 19.00 (3 and 16 for the separate tickets). If the train is late 20% of the time, the expected value of buying separate tickets is -$0.65 per trip. I think the real winning strategy is to buy a single ticket, then keep the Dinky portion of it if you end up not using it, and then buy only the non-Dinky portion of the ticket for your next trip. Though, this only works if you're buying physical tickets (both legs of the digital ticket activate at the same time, if I remember correctly), and confident that you will remember where you kept your ticket by the next time you take your trip.

A letter to deciding students.,dr_philbert,"As someone who frequently debates this same question, let me say that OP brings up a lot of valid points. I'll address these and offer my own opinion on them.

**1.) Princeton has problems**

Yes, it's true. What tour guides and current students say about eating clubs is that it makes Princeton extremely unique among its peers, but that doesn't mean it's a good thing. Yes, I am a member of an eating. Yes, I more or less enjoy it. No, I don't think eating clubs are a good thing. I think they unnecessarily separate you from your friends and force you to find new ones in your club. The last point isn't necessarily a bad thing, I've met some great new people in my club. However, what I don't understand is why we've come to just accept a social system that forces such an outcome. I also somewhat agree that eating clubs are unfair to lower income students, but I think the university is slowly takings steps to rectify this. However, some of the eating clubs are still largely based around one's apparent wealth.

**2.) I made the wrong choice coming here / Students who do not like it here are isolated**

This is largely a problem of your own creation, I'm sorry to say. It seems you spend so much time hating your life here, that you make no attempt to find other things that you enjoy. College is an amazing opportunity to find things you never knew you'd enjoy, but if you don't take the chance to find them, you never will. Get out of your comfort zone and go join a club that sounds mildly interesting, chances are you'll enjoy your time here more than you would if you spent it thinking about everything wrong.

**3.) The campus is pretty but that doesn't matter**

I'm not sure who chooses a college with the campus being a large factor, but I can tell you that just taking a walk around campus is a great study break on a nice day. Currently the weather's not great and that sucks, but taking the time to appreciate the grounds is a great way to get out sometimes and, for me at least, is a very nice thing. Also, the town is great despite what people may say. I make it a point to get off-campus at least once a week for a meal. It doesn't have to nice and it can be literally across the street, but, again, it's a great way to temporarily remove oneself from school.

**4.) Social life is homogenous**

This goes back to my earlier point. Yeah, eating clubs force a certain culture on campus, but that's largely on underclassmen who are somewhat insecure. If you look around, you'll find a lot of seniors who've left eating clubs and chosen to go independent because they realize that they don't need to conform to the eating clubs. If you spend your time searching instead of sulking, I can guarantee you'll find people whom you enjoy spending time with.

**5.) Prestige is mostly meaningless**

When you're at Princeton, the name is meaningless. After all, everyone here goes to Princeton. But I can guarantee you when you go out into the world, everyone will know the weight that name carries. The name, contrary to popular belief, will not secure you a $90k/yr starting salary without any effort of your own. You will have to work for it like any other college student. But, employers know the value a Princeton education carries, and will more often than not give you the benefit of the doubt. It helped me when I was trying to get into research without any previous experience.

**6.) Culture is upper-middle class here**

I'd probably tend to agree with this. No, not everyone's family owns a yacht or an estate, but people will make subtle efforts to display wealth. That's not to say this is overbearing because I've very rarely experienced this (full disclosure: I am upper-middle  class)

**7.) Fuck your parents**

OP is right here, don't choose a school because of what your parents want

**8.) Money does matter**

You will encounter trust-fund assholes, OP is right. But to say this is representative of the culture at-large is an overstatement. I have very rarely had interactions where money and wealth were themes, nor have I ever encountered someone making someone else feel bad for their apparent lack of welath.

**9.) There is a competitive culture, but it's not explicit**

This is true, but it's what you signed up for honestly. When you come to one of the top schools in the world, you and your classmates all got here by being competitive in high school. It's what's allowed us to achieve so highly up until this point. We all want to do our best, and I would say that this desire to be the best  manifests itself in a self-competitive aspect rather than externally competitive. Additionally, I have never once encountered someone who was hesitant to help another student with a concept, work, etc. . We compete against the standards we've set for ourselves and continually try to outdo them, which results in what seems like an externally competitive environment.

I think that's all the points. From the looks of OP's username it seems like OP's still a freshman, and this could be reason for a lot of these opinions. Let me be clear, OP isn't wrong, all of their criticisms are valid in some way, but freshman year is hard. We go from being some of the highest achievers from our home to just, well, average. But, for me, being average with some of the smartest kids in the country is a point of pride in and of itself and the desire to be more than average is what drives me to succeed.

I don't mean to make future 2020s debate their choice to come here, but know that freshman year will be hard. On top of social and lifestyle adjustments, you have the massive shift in academic standards as well. Keep in mind that all of this gets much much much better as you go on in your career. You find people with whom you get along with better, take courses that are much more interesting to you, no longer have to take bullshit, 250-person intro courses that are poorly taught.

A letter to deciding students.,bbqbot,"OP sounds sulky and uncomfortable in his own skin. Just like any college you go to, the experience is what **you** make of it. Especially at Princeton, nobody is going to spoon feed you answers, achievement, or happiness. If you want it, go work for it. That's the mentality that got you in in the first place.

You're damn right there's a competitive culture. You are among literally the best of the best at one of the most prestigious institutions in history. You think people are just going to waltz around without a care in the world? Wake up and welcome this final stepping stone before the real world. A world that doesn't give two shits if you're happy or how you feel.

Is the prevalent social life stratified via eating clubs? Yes. Is that perfect? Of course not. So you can either sit around and cry about it, or you could go out and try a few of the tremendously varied groups or clubs on campus and meet some like-minded people.

No duh the Princeton name doesn't matter on campus (unless you're making a joke of a pickup line). But consider yourself even more naive if you think it carries no weight once you've graduated. Here's another life lesson: networking is king. Unless you're a literal god at some given thing (math, sport, music, etc.), it's not what you know, it's who you know. And there is no better network of people than Princetonians present, past, and future. We reach far and wide in almost every conceivable interest or industry.

Any school, job, group, or anything: if you want to find problems, you will. It's just a matter of how you *want* to look at it. If you want to see rich assholes on campus, that's what you'll see, because yes, they are there. But if you want to see intelligent, talented peers many of whom are likewise overwhelmed by suddenly going from big fish in small pond to little fish in elite ocean, that's what you'll find. And you just might find a friend or two among them.

I came from a middle/lower-middle blue-collar background in bumblefuck, backwater redneck south. You bet I was put off by the money just oozing out of some people there. I did engineering, varsity sport, and went independent. I did not fit in with the ""regular"" Princeton crowd, but it isn't hard to find a great deal of others who feel the same way. Was I **happy**? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. But Princeton isn't the kind of place for people who are just looking to be happy. It's for those who wish to grow, achieve, and flourish. And no, I don't necessarily love Princeton. I see its many shortcomings plain as day. But I also see its tremendous strengths. You will be hard pressed to ever come upon a more empowering institution.

You have a choice to either let it get you down, or pave your own way forward. No, Princeton isn't for everyone. But if you can't or don't want to hack it, bow out: quit doing yourself, your classmates, and the school a disservice.

A letter to deciding students.,madmax771,"I just want to offer my own opinion here, because it may help deciding pre-frosh as well.

My background: I'm a solidly middle-class kid from a mostly white suburb. I'm a first generation college student; my paternal grandparents didn't graduate the 8th grade. My dad owns his own company and I spent pretty much every summer of high school working for him as a grease monkey. I'm currently a senior in the Woodrow Wilson School and do have a job for post-grad.

**1) Princeton has problems**

Duh Princeton has problems. Every school does. Princeton has a lot of problems. The clubs really aren't as expensive as you think they are; the only loans I've had to take out during all of Princeton have been to pay for my eating club. I'll graduate ~$15,000 in debt. To put that in perspective, my little brother is a junior at Penn State and currently in debt to the tune of ~$95,000-$100,000. The eating club debt was a choice I made. To me, the experiences I've had were well worth the debt. For some, that isn't the case, but it's a personal decision. There definitely is social stratification, but screw those people. They'll never learn if they haven't by now that they are extremely privileged.

**2) I made the wrong choice coming here**

Literally everyone has felt this way. After I was awake for days writing my independent work (which is completely ridiculous unless you want to go into academia), I thought, ""Wow, I could have gone to Rutgers (I'm from New Jersey) FOR FREE, and partied and lived my life."" Then I realized I was being stupid and lazy and that if anything was worth it, my education was. After struggling to juggle my team commitments (I walked on to sprint football here, so I was a varsity athlete) with my on-campus job with my social life and academics, I thought, ""Should have gone to Rutgers."" After getting rejected from a ton of internships and jobs, I thought, ""Should have gone to Rutgers.""

But then I take a step back and realize, holy shit, I go to Princeton. Anytime I tell people where I went to school, I immediately command a different level of respect. I don't have to prove I'm smart when I go to my job; I'll have to prove that I'm not smart. They say that Princeton is similar to the military academies in that people HATE IT while they're here because of the stress and work and exhaustion and stress (emphasis needed), but they absolutely LOVE it when they're done. That's why our reunions are absolutely incredible and our alumni are so dedicated.

And if you're isolated, I do blame that on you. My two best friends on this campus have extremely similar backgrounds to mine; broken families, middle-class but struggled to be there, and I'm closer to them than I am to my friends back home whose parents I call ""Mom"" and ""Dad."" You can find your people here; you just have to put effort in to look. Also, it takes time for those friendships to form. It wasn't until the end of sophomore year/beginning of junior year that I felt so close to them.

**3) Pretty Campus**

Agree with one of the other posters, taking a walk is a huge stress relief. Plus, it's just nice to have such a beautiful place to walk through and enjoy.

**4) Social Life is Homogenous**

It 100% can be. But like I said, you'll find your group. I'm in Cannon, which is stereotyped as one of the jock clubs, and it's incredibly diverse, but you wouldn't know that until you're in the club. There are all kinds of different friend groups within my club, even though from the outside we look homogenous. I'm sure it's similar in literally every other club.

**5) Prestige is meaningless**

This is flat wrong. Like seriously, flat wrong. I've had job offers simply because I went to Princeton. During the recruiting process for one of the banks, a CEO said, ""I only come to the Ivies and Ivy equivalents because I know you're the smartest group I'll encounter."" Prestige is real, you just don't know it until you graduate/interact with the real world.

**6) Culture is upper-middle class here**

OP is totally correct here. But at the same time, who cares what the culture is. It hasn't stopped me from dressing however I want or acting however I want. People aren't as ""fake"" as OP thinks they are.

**7) Fuck your Parents**

TRUEEEEEEEE.

**8) Money Does Matter**

Well duh. Money always matters. Does it suck that I couldn't go on nice vacations? Yeah. Does it suck that I couldn't go out to dinner every single time my friends did? Yeah. Does it suck that I had to take an on-campus job and work minimum 10hrs/week to afford my cell phone and new clothes and stuff? Yeah. Did it suck having to work during winter breaks and having to worry about money when it came to internships? Yeah. But who cares. That's my life. You have that at other schools too, so I don't know why OP is acting like it doesn't. Similar to what I said above, the people who comment on stuff like that are just too privileged to understand, so why does it even matter. I've been broke before. I lost 30 pounds in high school because I didn't eat lunch ever because my family simply couldn't afford the $2/day it was for school lunch but we weren't qualified for reduced price lunch. Compared to that, this is luxurious. Sure, people will complain about being broke and their parents will then buy them tons of crap. But OP must be jealous or something because that's just life. Do something about it and work hard to make sure your kids don't have the same issues.

**9) Competitive Culture**

People here are competitive, but it's mostly internal. Never once have I had someone refuse to help me because they wanted a better grade or something. People might be too busy, but they'd never be outright dicks like that. And people got here by being Type-A competitive people. But wake up OP, the world is competitive. It's dog-eat-dog, and I think Princeton is pretty chill when it comes to that tbh.

A letter to deciding students.,maximilliano13,"> This is largely a problem of your own creation

I am not a student at Princeton but I have grown up in the town and now attend a school with a very similar culture but worse academics. 

This really isn't fair to say based on OP's post. I have heard the phrase ""you find your place at Princeton"" numerous times but that can be extremely hard to do. If OP is the kind of person that enjoys to stay in on weekends they won't find people that they connect with by going out. The people that they are looking for are also staying in. Sure joining clubs and trying new things is a good way to meet a lot of new people but this doesn't guarantee you will meet *your* people. 

At the same time you may be 100% right. It is possible that OP is in their first year at school and is getting very frustrated because they haven't found their place yet but they also haven't tried much. The point I really want to make is that, as someone who is in a similar position as OP, it isn't always as simple as joining a club or trying something new so I think blaming it on OP is not a fair assumption to make.

The progressive culture millennials have adopted might not be the progressivism of the 1960s, but it's even further from conservatism; it's the hyperbolic descendent of 1960s liberalism, and it's the direct result of the victim mindset and borderline socialist liberalism academia's been fostering for all these years. Liberalism on campus - and in the wider world nowadays - is about restriction of speech, censorship and borderline fascism, precisely because they've taken the ""tolerance"" values of earlier liberals to the extreme. And it's not liberals acting like conservatives - since college conservatives are the ones fighting against it. If you're going to judge a situation, actually know what's going on - instead of taking a cheap shot at politics you don't like without being familiar with the matter.

I think the culture here is very hard to grasp even if you are allowed to spend three days here during Preview, since a lot of stuff about Princeton is subtle. One thing I can comment on elitism is that it is only relevant in your life if you surround yourself with the wrong people - in my freshman year I was unhappy because I surrounded myself with social-climbing folks, but now I've found true friends and the elitism doesn't affect me at all.

Personally, I think having a car is essential to doing most of the nice things in the area outside of the Palmer Square shops. Terhune, Grounds for Sculpture, and the Pennsylvania Dutch Market, for example—very short drive but would take you a while and cost a lot any other way. 

Also depends on the department. Plasma grad students have to go to PPPL so they often get cars if they don't have them already.

There are weekend shuttles that can get you to the shopping malls on US-1, and [Princeton Shopping Center](http://www.princetonshoppingcenter.com/) is within biking/jogging distance. [Princeton Farmer's Market](https://www.princetonfarmersmarket.com/) is also available weekly outside [Princeton Public Library](https://princetonlibrary.org/) (Summer series) or inside [Princeton Family YMCA](https://princetonymca.org/) (Winter series) as another option for groceries.

Getting to classes/labs on campus would mostly be by foot/biking/or campus shuttles if you live on-campus, as [student parking](https://transportation.princeton.edu/students/parking) is limited and inconvenient. The [bike-sharing program](http://bike.zagster.com/princeton/) is great for getting around on-campus and even over to Forrestal Campus through the D&R Canal State Park Trail.

Of course having a car is much more convenient for groceries or traveling outside of the Princeton bubble (e.g. getting to US-1 shopping malls, Plainsboro, Hamilton, New Brunswick, Edison, etc.), though there's also an option for [car-sharing](https://www.enterprisecarshare.com/us/en/programs/university/princeton.html).

Or did maybe the lack of tenants force them to raise apartment maintenance recently?  There has to be some sort of symbiotic relationship between apartment maintenance and store rent, that they both supplement each other, and if monthly fees went up for apartment owners, they might just lower the price to just be out of the maintenance side........which may explain the asking price drops.

Why Princeton for a CS master's?,myetel,">Princeton being Princeton, I'm a little concerned about how master's students are treated as opposed PhD students when it comes to academic mentorship and opportunities. I've also heard horror stories (not necessarily from Princeton, but from similar big-name CS schools) of PhD advisors 

*20 PhD here. I wasn’t in CS but had friends who were (both PhD and masters students). No need to worry about how masters students are treated compared to PhD students. There isn’t a pecking order like you’re describing. That’s just your imposter syndrome whispering doubt in your head. We all have it. Try to tell it to shut the fuck up. 

As for advisor horror stories, that kind of relationship is going to be hit and miss anywhere you go. Do your due diligence when you’re applying to grad school. If you’re invited on campus visits, ask the grad students you meet to lay the cards plainly on the table about the pros and cons of the program, the faculty, and the social life. Grad school is HARD. It’s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows anywhere you go. It’s better to be armed with realistic expectations than a false sense of security. 

As for why Princeton — again, I wasn’t in CS, so I can’t speak to the minutiae of department culture. That being said, I do know that Princeton stands apart from peer institutions (e.g. Harvard and Stanford) in CS that it pays its masters students. **This is huge.** There is so much to be said for the impact financial security (or lack thereof) has on our mental health. Princeton pays its students very well, and as a masters student you’re basically guaranteed to live in campus housing (below market value) while you’re there. I pinched pennies, but I was actually able to save money while in grad school. If you find yourself in a situation where you’re choosing between multiple programs, unless you’re independently wealthy, **whether or not you get paid should be a MAJOR deciding factor.**
 
Cons about Princeton: it’s a sleepy town. The orange bubble is real and can be a real drag at times. As a grad student you’ll always feel second chair to the undergrads. We all know Princeton is primarily and undergraduate institution coming in, but I don’t think it really hit how comparatively under-supported grad students are treated by the administration. At the end of the day, though, it’s still Princeton. Our lot as grad students is still much better than at other schools (which the faculty/admins so persistently remind us whenever we gripe).

Okay, that's fair. So in another universe, I would absolutely pursue a PhD. I love research, I'm incredibly academically curious, and my fields of interest (as I mention in the post) are heavily academic. However, I absolutely do not feel comfortable applying or committing myself to PhD programs. Of my three fields of interest, I really don't know which one to pursue. My gut says I'm not ready for a PhD, and I don't think I'd be a good PhD candidate at this point. I really want more time to explore the field and take more classes in the fields I'm interested in, and I'm grateful to be a place financially where I don't have to worry too much about the financial implications (literal money cost and opportunity cost) of pursuing a master's. I have little to no interest in plain software engineering, and while there are other jobs in CS (or in related fields) that I could move into out of undergrad, I think I'd really regret not taking the time to study more. I guess you could say that I'm a bit of a late-bloomer academically, and that I've really just run out of time as an undergrad. I want to pursue a PhD, but I don't feel ready for that. A master's thus feels like the logical next step.

Why Princeton for a CS master's?,luchak,"Okay, I can sort of see where you're coming from. If direct financial and opportunity cost are truly no obstacle and you're looking for some time to explore, I can see how this might be interesting. And, in general, my advice for Ph.D. programs is that if you don't feel like you should do one, you shouldn't. In fact, you probably shouldn't do one unless a few people have tried to talk you out of one first. So your plan isn't absurd. That said, there are a couple of things I'd like to comment on:

> Of my three fields of interest, I really don't know which one to pursue. [...] I really want more time to explore the field and take more classes in the fields I'm interested in

There is an _enormous_ difference between taking classes and doing research. I'd argue that, for many domains, the right job can give you a better idea of whether you might enjoy working in that field than taking classes would - and will provide better context for helping you frame and direct your own work further down the road. But, yeah, that's not true for everything; if you wanted to work in (say) complexity then work experience won't be nearly as relevant as it would in systems.

If you haven't really had a taste of these domains yet, then classes might help. But if you have and you're not sure if you want to continue - trying to figure out how to get your hands dirty might be the best course of action.

> Princeton being Princeton, I'm a little concerned about how master's students are treated as opposed PhD students when it comes to academic mentorship and opportunities.

Yeah, this is going to generally be an issue at US R1 institutions. Look at it from the advisor's perspective: the master's student will be around for two years, the Ph.D student for ~6 (varies by university, subfield, advisor, etc. - but whatever). Both students will take a similar number of classes over their time in the department and a similar amount of time to get up to speed. Which student provides a better return on investment?

Some professors may be more mercenary and some may be more well-meaning, but you're going to be feeling the above logic to _some_ degree regardless. If the professor is especially nice/selfless, if you show exceptional promise, or if you can attach yourself to a larger project, you will be in better shape. You will have some appeal as an extra set of hands, for projects in areas where that is valuable.

Finding an advisor who is a very close interest match at a less prominent school, or who otherwise might be having trouble getting excellent students (but who you'd still want to work with) would also be a strategy - if you do this, make sure in advance that the advisor also wants to work with you, since you may not have good backup plans once you arrive.

Also, at least in the US, many CS departments offer master's programs because they're an easy source of money. I would generally assume that this is true for any master's without a substantial research component. That doesn't mean that they're necessarily the wrong choice for you, but it's a consideration to be aware of. If you get the sense that this is a case, make sure that what you're being sold aligns with what you want. In particular, make sure that the main value of the program is access to interesting classes, and _not_ the credential that the program provides.

> I've also heard horror stories (not necessarily from Princeton, but from similar big-name CS schools) of PhD advisors

Yeah, vet your advisor before committing. Talk to their existing and former students. If it's clearly not working get out sooner rather than later, the longer it takes to get settled the worse shape you'll be in.

> I'm looking at a lot of European programs as well.

It's possible that this might make sense, I'm not super-clear on the situation with European master's programs.

---

Having said all of that, maybe here's my advice. First, figure out if your main goal is to take classes out of personal interest, or to do research to figure out if research is something you're interested in. If you want to take classes: cool, go somewhere where you'll get to take the classes you want. If you want to do research: strongly consider finding a relevant industry position, if you can (research programmer? tech transfer engineer?) - or applying for a Ph.D. program with the intent of bailing with a master's. Upside: cheaper, more attention from advisor, built-in option to continue. Downside: you absolutely cannot let on that that is your plan, and when the time comes you'll have to be very honest with yourself about whether you want to finish.

Also, in the research case: **choose advisors, not programs**. Figure out a few people you'd be interested in working with at each school. While it can be hard to tell if a professor is taking students at any given time - they might say so on their website, there's a chance that they might answer a cold email - work from a slate of advisors you'd be happy to work with. You can incorporate general program strength, quality of life, etc. as secondary concerns, but seriously, start from the advisor first. You may not end up working with anyone on your list, but you want to make sure that you've got at least _one_ specific outcome that you'd likely be happy with at any place you end up going.",5,,1597384624.0,g1ex25k,False,False,1597384001.0,2020-08-14 00:46:41

There are a few apartment complexes in that area that might be more affordable than Princeton proper. The Eaves, Canal Point, and Yorkshire village come to mind. You might have to walk a mile to the bus stop though. Unfortunately, Princeton is surrounded by suburbs with limited public transportation. From New Brunswick you can take the train to Princeton junction and then switch to the dinky or a shuttle to Princeton.

The eating clubs at Princeton University are private institutions resembling both dining halls and social houses, where the majority of Princeton upperclassmen eat their meals. Each eating club occupies a large mansion on Prospect Avenue (Prospect Street until 1900), one of the main roads that runs through the Princeton campus, with the exception of Terrace Club which is just around the corner on Washington Road.  This area is known to students colloquially as ""The Street"". Princeton's eating clubs are the primary setting in F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1920 debut novel, This Side of Paradise, and the clubs appeared prominently in the 2004 novel The Rule of Four.

There is an AB CS degree, though, that you could easily switch into, but the engineering school has a lot of prereqs that ""have"" to be fulfilled by the end of freshman year (which makes the AB -> BSE switch so tough).

Math at Princeton,andrewjw,"There are absolutely IMO qualifying / Putnam-level math geniuses in the department, but also a bunch of perfectly regular smart people who really like math. You can absolutely suceed without being on the level of the top math majors. I'd probably recommend you take MAT 215/217 freshman year, instead of MAT 216/218, if you are concerned about this. I would not recommend either of the tracks for engineers (201/202 or 203/204): it sounds like 201/202 would have no new content; I took MAT 203/204 and recommend them to anyone with similar background to you but who is not considering math (since I think they are more practically useful to engineers) but if you are consideirng math then 215/217 or 216/218 would much better prepare you for math departmentals.

It's very easy to switch from Math to AB COS. They have the same gen ed requirements and many (all?) 300-level math courses are COS cognates. If you are considering COS, take COS 126/226/217 during your first two years. MAT 217 also fills the COS linear algebra requirement. (MAT 202 or 204 also satisfies this. MAT 218 does not if I remember correctly.)

It's also not too hard to switch from Math to BSE COS, the only difference between AB and BSE COS is that BSE requires multivar in addition to linear (this is satisfied by MAT 201 or 203 or 216, but not 215 iirc), and requires physics and chem (and CS), but does not require foreign language. So, if you are seriously considering any BSE majors, you'd want to make sure to knock out whichever of physics and chem you do not have AP placement from.

I don't know very many people who switched to ORFE from other departments. That might be a statement about the department or about how flexible the COS major is. All of the BSE majors are designed so that if you knock out your BSE math/chem/physics/cs requirements freshmen year then you can start them sophomore year. So if you are considering ORFE then the natural course to take freshman year would be ORF 245.

This gives you the following list for next fall/spring:

* Writing seminar
* Foreign language, unless you test fully out of a language (if you test partway in, take the rest freshman year before you forget it)
* MAT 215 and 217
* Physics 105 and 106 (or 103 and 104) unless you have 5 on both AP physics C tests; if you do, then Chem 201 or 207 unless you have a 4 on AP Chem in which case skip this bullet point entirely. (If you have neither physics nor chem then take physics and push off chem till sophomore year, taking it only if you switch to BSE)
* COS 126 definitely (required by AB and BSE COS and by ORFE, will give you a good idea of if you would like to do more COS or math)
* ORF 245 if you want to try an ORFE class
* some gen ed requirements if you still have fewer than 5 classes (or 4 in the semester with writing sem)

Then sophomore year:

* some math classes
* finish foreign language
* chem, if you still need it and are still considering BSE majors
* COS 217 and 226
* ORF 309 would likely be the next ORF class to take. ORF 245 if you didn't take it freshman year
* some gen ed requirements in any free slots

Math at Princeton,blazed3bets,"I'm a math major at Princeton, no IMO-genius (qualified for USAMO *barely*), and I find it to be an extremely difficult but rewarding road. I come from a similar background from you I think. The lectures go fairly fast and non-canonical, meaning the sequence of topics are fairly unique compared to other universities. For instance, MAT 345 with Katz (who is absolutely brilliant btw), while deceptively called Algebra I, you cover very little of the intro abstract alg sequence. Instead, he approaches in a cool way where he goes straight from basic group, ring theory to a bit of commutative alg / rep theory to finally motivate Galois theory THEN cover symmetric / alternating group (motivated by automorphisms on roots of polynomials). 

Switching from A.B to B.S.E or vice versa is not hard, it can be done with a simple meeting with the Dean. But note that BSE has more (somewhat tedious) course requirements, mostly intro sciences and calculus. If you can test out of them with AP's you're set. Otherwise you could run into some roadblocks.

If you want to leave the option of switching into ORFE and CS at the end of first year, I would just recommend taking COS 126 anyways (because it's a fantastic course and a ton of non-CS people take it).

Very collaborative. Problem sets in NEU 201/202 (the typical intro to neuroscience sequence) are graded for completion, so long as you put in an effort to actually solve the problem. The quizzes are all easier than the problem sets and mostly multiple choice, which reduces a lot of stress. I have no qualms at all so far with the way the department is being run, and Professor Boulanger is really friendly and funny.

>Are the research opportunities as plentiful/accessible as advertised?

Do you mean on a university-wide scale? If so, then yes. You can find several open research positions in many different departments through the Student Employment page on Princeton’s website. I’ll be doing paid research this year in the Department of Psychology ($12/hr), and the topic of study intertwines with many neuroscience concepts (a lot of biopsychology and neurophysiology). You can also contact specific professors that you might want to work with and ask them if they have any research projects you could help out on. Sometimes the professors don’t list these research positions on Student Employment, so it’s definitely an option if you don’t see one you like on the online job listings. 

>How big are introductory classes?

In neuroscience, they’re big but not overwhelmingly so. My intro to neuroscience lecture (there’s only one possible lecture you can be in) has 150 people which is the maximum possible enrollment. In chemistry you’ll find that they’re bigger, with about 250 people. However, with all of these big lecture courses, you’ll meet every week in smaller classes called precepts. These are classes of around 15 people in which you can discuss specific material you didn’t understand from lecture, and generally work through anything relevant with a much smaller group.

A Better Game? Sprint Football at Princeton,madmax771,"You realize 3/4 of our team didn't play football in high school and our opponents have guaranteed admission slots (Cornell and Penn each have 4-5/year, navy and army have 8/year) for players that were typically captains of their high school teams? 

On top of that, pretty much every other team cheats weight. On the broadcast of us vs. Penn from the other night, the commentators were openly laughing about how a player was too large to play but he ""was 172.0 on the dot, every time"" followed by chuckles. Navy (one of the top two teams every year) lost to Franklin Pierce this year, which is the first time they lost to a non-academy opponent in at least 5 years. We suspect it to be because the league instituted a rule that required a league official to observe 1 weigh in.

You probably think it's funny and that our program is a joke, but it's not. My teammates and I dedicate up to 20 hours/week trying to get better. It's not our fault that the administration has gutted our program. The last year we had recruited athletes was '99. Coincidentally, that was our last league win.

Don't comment on stuff you don't understand. It just makes us resent the student body more for treating us like crap when they think that we're okay with losing like that. It fucking sucks.

The only thing you cannot comment on is your final grade, and that is so by design: oftentimes, a low grade can unfairly jaundice one's assessment of a class.  Requesting to revise your course evaluation is therefore highly unreasonable.  I've also been in classes with stringent grading practices; for example, in a physics class, I received a C+ although my grade average was (slightly) above average.

However, the CS classes definitely exposed me to more rigorous programming thinking as well as gave good practice in various types of programming.

The basic sophomore level classes, 217 (Systems programming) and 226 (Algorithms and Data Structures) are excellent. I also learned a lot in Operating Systems, 333 (independent project class with Brian Kernighan), 340 (discrete math for computer science), 432 (information security)

In short, I came in as a fairly competent programmer, came out as a very competent programmer with experience with various platforms and types of programming, as well as theoretical background. Princeton CS students do quite well as interns at software companies!

Princeton also gives you many chances to do independent research with professors. Professors are very friendly about taking on undergrads. I did summer research in EE with one professor and my senior independent project in CS with another. I'm not sure how much this prepared me for grad school research though in terms of learning how to read papers and publish. I might be a terrible unmotivated grad student actually.

You can take grad classes as well, getting the consent of instructor is fairly easy if you have something to justify it. I didn't take any myself but I knew a good number of students who did.

There are some places where you notice ""filthy richness"", mostly around some of the eating clubs, but in general... not really. A lot of the people I knew were actually on financial aid.

There are two preview weekends: April 19-21 and April 26-28.  Yes, Princeton Preview is the preview weekend where our campus is inundated with Prefrosh wearing orange lanyards (You'll understand if/when you come).  

> What's the perception of engineering students? Do they mesh with other student groups or keep to themselves?

At every school you'll have your people who don't mesh with everyone, but who you interact with at Princeton is mostly defined by what you do outside of classes.  In the marching band?  You're going to hang with bandies.  On the Ultimate Frisbee team?  You're hanging them.  Of course, this doesn't limit you to one group (I'm in like 4 myself and easily bounce around) and you do hang with friends you make from study groups and precepts.  

As for the perception, I'm not too sure.  Engineering is known to be more work intensive than other majors and AB student understand and respect that?  You know, I'm not too sure.  I'm in engineering, and my friends vary with their majors.  It doesn't segregate you from meeting others, but when you get to collectively vent with all your engineering friends, it's very stress relieving.

>Does Princeton have any sort of ""hackerspace"" on or near campus? Robotics/tech competitions?

They're trying to create and foster that sorta atmosphere on campus, evidence by the tech startup weeks we have and the hackathon I'm currently taking part in right now.  Computer Science is popular so there's no shortage of people you can talk to about what they coded for facebook, how their first company went, or what they found out was the best way to do the travelling salesman problem.

As for robotics, I have no clue.  There is a robotics club (I believe named [PAVE](http://pave.princeton.edu/)) and they helped build our remote control roomba for the Triangle show.

Lastly, don't panic! There's a reason that Princeton chose you to be here, and I have faith that you have the intellectual mettle to do these classes, if worst comes to worst.

"Hey, a hopeful high schooler here. General question for those who attend or had attended, what’s the general Culture at Princeton like?",,"Current sophomore here, and I just wanted to share my own experience! I would highly recommend trying to hear from as many people as possible, as each student's experience can be quite different. 

On your first point—Princeton is indeed quite academically focused and competitive, but much of this also depends on who you choose to surround yourself with. Most of my friends are fairly lax about grades, but your experience could be different if you hang around pre-med or pre-law types. I think a big part of whether you can be happy at Princeton is your ability to remove yourself from social/academic pressures, which is much easier said than done, but is definitely possible.

As for your second point, I have found the overall social culture to NOT be friendly and inviting. The exclusivity of eating clubs is completely incompatible with creating an inclusive social environment, and many extracurricular clubs are competitive to get into, which also creates a culture of exclusivity.

The flip side of this is if you *are* able to get into competitive clubs, you'll probably have a tight group of people to hang out with. There are also tons of non-competitive clubs and ways to make friends, but I don't think those activities form the overarching social culture at Princeton. This is not to say that I haven't made amazing friends here, but I do think you need to put in intentional effort to seek out inclusive spaces and tune out the type-A social/academic folks.

Everyone is high achieving and are skilled in different ways so grades are less of a focus. But that does depend on who you surround yourself with. 

I don’t think eating clubs are a good example of an uninviting social culture. At another school, you would similarly have to know people and rush to get into certain frats/sororities. I think Princeton does a lot to help freshmen find social groups (Zee groups, events hosted by colleges, intramurals, club fairs).

Thoughts on Woodrow Wilson School,iamqba,"I was a WWS major, 2015. I would describe Woody Woo (colloquial name for the major) as a ""build your own major"" across politics, economics, government, international relations, history, statistics, sociology, languages, and other disciplines. It is very interdisciplinary and applied (as opposed to math-heavy theoretical economics, or pure politics).  

Is it worth it: yes. But what do you mena worth it? Worth it usually implies some cost, what cost are you referring to? 

Was it a good experience: yes. The major really allows you to do whatever you want within it. And the junior year policy task force is really cool. 

What jobs does it open it: Of my friends that did the major, I would say 60% went into various forms of consulting (80% business, 20% government), 20% went into roles in the government bureaucracy, 15% went into other business roles, and 5% went into higher education.

Generally most first years live in the Graduate College, which is dorm-style living.  This is how you will meet most of your friends first year, in addition to your classmates of course.  The graduate bar (Dbar) is in the basement of the GC, it's usually pretty crowded on Friday/Saturday nights (with a high m/f ratio unfortunately).

Princeton vs. Stanford for Math,redrolor,"I’m making the same decision right now(Princeton REA admit thinking about Stanford.) If you’re thinking about things like cross admit ratios, I feel like they’re heavily skewed against Princeton because of premed and pre laws students being dissuaded by GPA. After talking with a lot of people and doing my research, I honestly think going to Princeton is the move. We both applied here early, which says something about both of us already. This may have been for different reasons, but our guts in both cases seemed to be on leaning this way. 

For me personally, I wanted to be in an environment where my friend group could extremely varied in interests and aspirations, while my major itself could be a relatively small, focused, and cooperative group of passionate students. 


Stanford, you’ll be surrounded by tons of incredible people, but the culture seems very homogenous. For example, 39% of students on campus of CS majors and a large percentage of STEM, so of your hypothetical five friends, two will probably be CS, 2 will be some STEM or maybe finance, and one will be a policy major or something. Point being, based on the relative proportions of each major, there is a huge push towards CS, STEM, and startups/entrepreneurship. 

Princeton, doing a similar search of majors and their relative sizes, has a markedly more diverse student body when it comes to interests. Doing the same hypothetical, you’d likely have 1 friend who is an ORFE/finance student, 1 hard science, a Woodrow Wilson policy major, 1 CS major, and an engineer.

This whole situation proved true in my own personal connections. The Stanford student I know went into CS, originally wanting to do engineering, and had tried creating 2 startups by junior year. The two Princeton students I know became a policy major and a neuroscience(premed) major. 

They’re both incredible schools, but the data I found about the breakdown of majors at each really spoke to the culture of each.

That said, Stanford does give a leg up in admissions to Stanford, and getting to other schools is slightly easier for graduate studies because of its higher GPA/grade-inflation. 

If I had to guess, you seem like you wanted to come to Princeton because you like to push yourself and didn’t want to take the already walked road to Stanford. In this case, there’s really no reason in second guessing yourself. I get it though, I have been doing the same thing for the last few months. Much of the arguments online are useless and just incited by prideful parents. The truth is that wherever you go, you’re going to have to work your tail off and earn your next spot in life, but the name of both colleges will precede yourself in getting interviews anywhere in the US(abroad is a different story, Stanford has the slight leg up here, but neither are actually as great as people may try to claim). Go with your heart. Also, we have admitted groupchats that we’d love for you to join. I can add you if you pm me.

ORFE is a super diverse major. You can focus on optimization, financial mathematics, operations research, etc. It also has a wide array of courses from other dep. that count as departmentals (classes that count toward your major). So I'd say it's a very flexible major. If you're interested in math but more towards applied and don't really want to deal with heavy abstractions, ORFE might be better (and consider a PACM, math minor).

On the other hand, COS might be better for you (with ORFE courses sprinkled in) if you prefer to be more hands on, build things, or simply are more inclined towards coding. Pretty simple.

For math, while I love the department and the experience I've had from it, it is a hard major. Perhaps the most chill department in terms of requirements and bureaucracy -- professors openly don't really care about administration and are willing to cater to your needs. Professors are absolutely the top of their specialty, with several Fields medalists and candidates. Name drop them and any serious math major in other colleges will drool. From my experience and talking with others, math at Princeton is a very unique exposure to the topic.

Feel free to pm me if you have any questions.

I'm still doing biology and neuroscience stuff(been taking a mol/neuro class and have done research in quant bio) but I'm taking ORFE because it gives you a broad understanding of many different fields in probability, financial mathematics, and optimization that can be applied elsewhere. 

If you're not sure what you want to be but if you want to be somewhere near cos/econ/math/anything quant related orfe is a really good major to start in. In terms of job prospects, ORFE is where you can basically get into any ib/consulting job if you put the right time in. ORFE is probably has the highest correlation of all the majors between work put in and the success/reward you get out.

Math at Princeton is a whole other beast that frankly, you shouldn't really be touching unless you either 1) feel super comfortable after taking MAT215/216/217(?) or 2) have a genuine passion for the topics they teach.

The environment is not cutthroat at all. I've got lots of help for academics and a repeated emphasis of Princeton academics is you need to work with your classmates. I will mention that many extracurriculars  are selective to an extent and require auditions, etc, but people here tend to be very much the opposite of cutthroat. 

Princeton students are super busy, and academics do take up a good chunk of time, and obviously many of us have high ambitions. Some of these people are definitely self-involved; some have probably let their wealth get to their head; but on the whole, don't worry. People here are super cool.

Questions from an incoming CS Master's student.,cartesiancategory,"CS MSE student here.

1) Sort of but not really. Yeah, you may not get told about important things, but more or less you are treated like a PhD student. The only thing is that you don't have a room in the building. TA training and orientation, etc. is held jointly with the PhD students. We're basically all the same.

2) Yes, it definitely is! I'm involved with research now; most of the masters' students are more into the courses and a light thesis, but if you want to get really involved, finding an advisor who is experienced and would be fine with you diving headfirst into a master's thesis will be possible. RAships are exclusively for PhD students insofar as all MSE students must do 4 semesters of TAing. However, we are not precluded from pursuing research (but we aren't really encouraged, either -- it's entirely you're prerogative).

3) Meh. Not very social IMO. I am American and while I share heritage with a lot of the international graduate students, I find that they stick together and tend to exclude Americans from their events. Again, that's on them, but it's hard to be social in my experience unless you spend a lot of time going to external events like GSG parties, game nights, etc. Making friends is harder in graduate school in general, though. It's not like undergrad, but this is more reflective of Princeton as a whole.

4) Yeah, we don't have strong unionizations here unfortunately. There are both graduate student groups vying for and against unionization, and you can find both of them at the club fair during orientation, etc. Pretty weird haha. The administration really cares for their undergrads, but grad students aren't treated as well as the undergrads are. You have to put a lot of effort to find out the details -- like club fair, etc. Also the actual graduate school is fine with replying to emails about important things (e.g. the dean personally replied to my email about the graduate tax waiver earlier this year), but the CS department is notoriously bad at handling administrative issues (the DGS, etc.). Princeton is ""liberal"" relative to most places, but they are in the ""traditional/classical"" school of liberalism. They're really resistant to changing their traditions despite being a liberal community. Kind of sucks sometimes. This culture will become obvious when you spend more time here.

5) Yeah, it's not as strong of a political climate as, say, Berkeley or something. But people do get involved and they do have events! There is a gun reform rally now, there was a graduate tax waiver protest earlier this year, and a bunch of us got together and organized a political day to call our senators about DACA repealing in the fall, etc. So you can definitely get involved politically, but it may be harder to find than you think. For a small campus, finding the niche communities serving interest groups is surprisingly challenging.

6) Princeton is beautiful, but I think in terms of social culture I strongly preferred my undergraduate school. In terms of academic culture, it's amazing here and they really do a good job at making sure you don't stress out too much -- my graduate classes were super flexible with everything since they know that we are busy with other work (research, TAing, etc.). Let me know if you have other questions!

7) Lul, yeah I'm considering applying in the fall for continuing on to the PhD. Guess I am going to grad school twice. XD",7,,False,dvgfret,False,False,1520636645.0,2018-03-09 17:04:05

What should I try not to miss on a trip to Princeton?,cavatiger,"On campus, make sure to visit both the north and south sides of campus. The official tours don't take you south of Frist (the student center, which is in the center of campus) and I think it's important for students to see the architecture, etc. on both sides since they're so different. TL;DR the whole campus certainly doesn't look like beautiful Rocky/Mathey and Blair Arch! A physics major might want to see if you could get into Jadwin or Fine or even Lewis Library, all southeast on campus, so you can see where you'll be spending a lot of your time. Try also to go into Chancellor Green Library—it's my fav library that's open to the public and is absolutely gorgeous.

Off campus, make SURE you eat on Nassau Street at one of the non-chain restaurants! I suggest Jules Pizza, Chuck's Spring Street Cafe (AMAZING wings), D'Angelo's, PJ's, or 30 Burger depending on what you're craving. Also, stop into Small World since it's such a student staple here.

Newly accepted student for 2018 with some questions!,ebag7125,"Two cents from a senior:

* Campus culture: I think it just depends on who you talk to and who your friends are. Generally, I find people here are pretty friendly. Driven, yes; cutthroat, I don't think so.
* Administration: In my experience, the administration is super easy to get along with and very helpful. It's probably similar at other small, private universities. Friends at big public schools are always dealing with redtape in terms of registering for classes, submitting paperwork etc, but it's a lot easier here.
* Grade deflation: Honestly, I haven't really thought about it much. I don't think it makes any negative difference.
* Food: Admittedly, I'm pretty easy to please, but I have always thought the dining hall food is really good. As an independent student (not in an eating club), my one food complaint is that there is no good/cheap grocery store within walking distance of campus. There are buses though...",5,,False,cgg562v,False,False,1396233963.0,2014-03-30 21:46:03
Newly accepted student for 2018 with some questions!,lavenderblue,"**Culture**
It is what you make of it.  Get in with a certain crowd and it's frantically study driven. Another, and it's people who blow off their education. Another, and they are super cool, interesting, relaxed, and smart.  Don't get too locked into a friend group right away and assume that is what everyone is like, because people shake into like groups by junior year or so.  It is not at all academically cutthroat.  I tend to be obvious about social cutthroatism because I'm pretty introverted.  I've found that a lot of socializing gets done over studying/study groups, at least until you are an upperclassman. You do have to make time (and sometimes schedule) hanging out with people but again, once you are in an eating club, all your friends will just be hanging around anyway.

**Administration**
They are pretty laid back and relaxed.  As long as you haven't had/made trouble, they are very accommodating.  If you have made trouble, you can easily wind up on the wrong side of a deaf ear. They do not tolerate deliberate nonsense (ie, the frosh who was expelled this year for dealing drugs).  If you are in trouble, honestly, they aren't the best.  There is a problem here (like at most universities) with some accusations of coverups of assaults, mental issues etc. If you struggle with mental health issues, this can be a pretty rough place.  They will want you to go home.

**Grade Deflation** Seriously don't think about it.  I like it, because that feeling when you do get an A is AMAZING.  It can be a rough transition, since likely you have a line in your head where ""A""=Good work/average performance to you and you have to adjust that to a B.  So it feels like you are failing until you reset a bit.  But it doesn't hinder student/student cooperation at all.  As another commenter said, it turns the students into an ""us vs the grading policy"" study buddy system.  And no.  Doesn't affect acceptance. People know Princeton is Princeton, and they don't have different rates for us as those from different schools.

**Food**  Really good!  The dining hall food can get boring, and the quality of the eating clubs varies a lot, but overall the food is of high quality and the presence of 4 different kitchens plus the Frist gallery plus eating clubs gives you plenty of variety overall.

Newly accepted student for 2018 with some questions!,ahanna17,"Just to add on: academically, people are pretty inclined to collaborate and work together. The policy of grade deflation has the benefit of turning it into a narrative of ""us vs the school,"" where people try to overcome the particular challenges of academics. That said, of course you're going to find people who are only out for themselves. It's really easy to ignore them. Socially, I would argue that it's actually more competitive, especially when bicker rolls around sophomore year. I signed in to avoid all that, but that's a personal decision everyone makes. 
To address grade deflation specifically: personally, I think its overall effect is positive. I work a hell of a lot harder and feel significantly more rewarded by good marks I receive. Didn't receive my first A level grade until December of freshmen year, but when I did I went dancing through the hallways.

I also probably got to know the people in my classes my freshman year a lot more than most because I was in a bunch of small classes; no huge intro courses like MAT 201, PHY 105, or PSY 101, so I suppose my advice should be taken with a grain of salt.",2,,False,c29y4da,False,False,1312412981.0,2011-08-03 18:09:41

The rescols sponsor many peer advising events, and I believe most departments have open houses for frosh to explore. If all that fails, each department has a department representative (dep rep), who is a professor whose job is to be friendly to undergrads and answer questions about the major. They are usually easy to set up an appointment with if that's what you want. [This](http://www.princeton.edu/ua/departmentsprograms/wws/) says that Brandice Canes-Wrone is the dep rep for Woody Woo.

By the way, IMO you're doing the right thing by getting an idea of the courses you want to take.

If you're 2014, my experience will apply to you. I have like 2 or 3 classes under my belt going into Junior year for WWS. WWS has a fair number of departmentals (although it's nothing compared to MOL or engineering, as far as I can tell) so it's nice to get them out of the way.

They just changed the WWS major, though to be non-selective (thank god), as I'm sure you know. I think that applies to 2015. I'm not sure of the requirements, but I think they're pretty straightforward, and they let you explore related majors. But to get back to your question, yes you can take 300-level courses as an underclassman.

But the reason my post might actually be valuable to you besides answering ""yes"" is to say, unless you're an engineer or something, plan to change your academic plans. Almost every semester so far I've signed up for 5-6 classes, dropped half of them, and enrolled in others just based on the first lecture. Especially with a major like WWS you'll have the wiggle room to pick and choose so you only get good classes.

Also I agree with rafiss--advisors can suck a lot. They got me to take MAT 204. Second worst decision of my academic career. (#1 was taking Integrated Science as a freshman.

Did I mention Princeton is the #1 undergraduate school in the country.  Harvard may have the number slot according to world news and report, but they don't have an undergrad focus.  I doubt anyone there sees a professor.  Princeton has a 5:1 undergrad:graduate student ratio, and all of my classes are taught by professors.  Therefore Princeton > Harvard and Princeton is number 1.  Sorry, I've been meaning to put this down to paper for a while.

Class of '15,Kimba_the_White_Lion,"Thanks, I actually discovered the show from reddit and really like.  It's so corny, but just enough that it is awesome.  I watched all 52 episodes on youtube in a span of a month.

Back to Princeton.  If you aren't a big drinker/partier, no worries, neither was I.  Half of my friends don't party while the other half party like it's no tomorrow (I happen to be in one of the ""non-existant"" frats on campus).  You can only not have a social life if you work hard to not make friends.  Keep in mind that every single freshman you meet is essentially in the same boat.  They left all of their friends from home, are looking to find people with the same interests, and are nice as hell.  Princeton is the nicest place I've ever been; you can sit down at any random table during dinner and make new friends that way (That's what I did).

You might not be a drinker/partier now, but I think it is almost inevitable.  You can have loads of fun at the street or at a dorm party just hanging with your friends.  I hate dancing, but thoroughly enjoy dancing with friends just because.  As I said before, if you have no social, that's because you tried really hard not to be a loner.

Congrats on Swarth and Brown, I've got friends at both.  For Brown, I hear they're all stoners (not that we don't have em here) but it might just be the source I'm hearing this from.  

Also, do OA.  Really, best thing ever.  If you have any more questions, ask for my skype/number and I'll be glad to talk about anything.

Friends who went to various other great schools ended knowing about a dozen people really well, and not many others at all. You will end your time in Princeton with a dozen great friends, hundreds of good friends and hundreds more acquaintances.

Drinking is not necessary at all. The drinking culture is certainly strong at Princeton, but you can have a fantastic time socially and in the clubs without drinknig (except, perhaps, T.I.). Dance, be social, drink soda, make friends and you'll have a great time. If you stay away from the clubs, you'll certainly have no worse a time than if you followed the same philosophy at any other school, and probably still have a better time.",0,,False,c1og541,False,False,1302287307.0,2011-04-08 13:28:27

Hurricane Sandy (unofficially referred to as ""Superstorm Sandy"") was the deadliest and most destructive hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second-costliest hurricane in United States history. Classified as the eighteenth named storm, tenth hurricane and second major hurricane of the year, Sandy was a Category 3 storm at its peak intensity when it made landfall in Cuba. While it was a Category 2 hurricane off the coast of the Northeastern United States, the storm became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record (as measured by diameter, with winds spanning 1,100 miles (1,800 km)). Estimates as of 2015 assessed damage to have been about $75 billion (2012 USD), a total surpassed only by Hurricane Katrina.

But here's why. It offers flexibility to learn at your will. It all depends on your priorities. And since everyone learns in different ways, this flexibility indeed makes it heaven. The school supports you physically, financially, and academic resource-wise. You can get very lucky with advising and mentorship that will help you think in new, fresh ways. The prestige of the degree in the real-word allows you to be flexible with what you do to earn it. The alumni network allows you to obtain a stunning array of insider knowledge and connection. There are social niches that you can find to maximize your experience at Princeton. ""Fun"" is what you define it, and you can have as much of it as you can handle. Yes, there are strong winds of peer pressure directing you towards certain trends; yes it can be difficult to truly establish oneself as an individual when there are so many competing personalities, but if you have a will there is a way.
Princeton obviously has its major issues: often blatant racism, socioeconomic segregation, elitist culture, drinking problems, old money interests, obstruction of social justice by administration and student apathy, large obsession with status, money, self-accomplishment, competition, small things. Do not be fooled that 100% of Princetonians walk away with only amazing experiences. 
But also don't be too concerned that the stereotypes that do have some real-life basis will severely impact your quality of life at Princeton. 
Instead, ask yourself, am I an intellectual? Do I value learning and service for their own sake? Do I want to go to a place that will allow me free reign to direct my life towards those ends? 
Even more importantly, do I have to go to Princeton to accomplish this? No, of course not. But like I said, it's as close to paradise as you're gonna get.",14,,False,d6zkula,False,False,1472355305.0,2016-08-27 22:35:05

Some questions from a prospective freshman undergraduate - would appreciate answers soon.,maximilliano13,"I am not a student at Princeton but I am a college freshman that lives in town and my dad teaches a freshman seminar so I can try and help you out. 

As far as the preppyness of the school goes: Princeton can be a preppy school but you won't be a social outcast for not wearing a brand new pair of Sperries every day. I spend a lot of time on campus and you see kids wearing stuff from shorts and t-shirt to dress pants and dress shirt. It really doesn't matter who you are you will be able to find 'your' place at Princeton. 

I'm not 100% on this but the grading-system used to be like other schools where they limited the amount of A's given out but I believe there have been some changes over the past few years. 

There is a train on campus called the Dinky. This takes you to the Princeton Jct train station in 15 minuets. From there it is $17 (last time I checked) and an hr to NYC. You could go into the city no problem. The school also runs trips into NYC to see plays and other activities quite often.

Cornell has 22k students. It's a research powerhouse, and there's always a lot going on academically that you can get involved in.

However, it's in the middle of nowhere and you can get lost in the crowd, cold, dreary, and stressed out.

Princeton has 8k students. It's got great professors and they'll get to know you and you them during the course of your studies. It's relatively close to Philly and NYC so you can always get away from it all for a weekend.

Some questions from a prospective freshman undergraduate - would appreciate answers soon.,cdragon1983,"1) Med schools don't care about what you study ... like, at all, so long as you've got the pre-med requirements (three recent pre-meds I've known have been concentrators in computer science, mathematics, and philosophy, respectively. And Princeton's got plenty of options even among the more traditional pre-med tracks: EEB, MolBio, a biochemistry focus within MolBio (including the opportunity to study abroad at the BioChem-specific program with Oxford), Chemistry, Neuroscience. There's also a new program in cognitive science. 

2) The thesis is as much as you make it. You can do legitimate cutting-edge research, or you can scuffle through with a sort of interesting project that you know will never really amount to much. The faculty are very used to both: they can tell (or you can explicitly tell them!) whether to treat you like a sort of junior grad student, or whether to just keep you on track with the required deadlines, etc. and make sure you're doing something that will have some sort of result one way or the other. Typically the faculty won't *write* any of the thesis, but they'll hook you up with more background research than you know what do with in coming up with a project, lab or research methods resources, and lots of technical and project management advice.

3) There's plenty of preppy people. There's plenty of nerdy people. There's plenty of just ""normal"" well-rounded kids from around the country and the world. I certainly understand the perception of Princeton as overwhelmingly preppy, but I don't think it's entirely true (perhaps because my background is in the engineering school?)

4) The grading policy (dubbed ""grade deflation"") is dead. Departments are still working on how to give meaningful feedback via grades and other means without having any sort of explicit quota handed down from on high. I never thought it was that big a deal in the first place, but it's a fair concern -- though I'd say if you're intending to be in science or engineering, grade deflation isn't nearly the concern as in the pure humanities.

Also, I'd be remiss not to give [RealTalk Princeton](http://realtalkprinceton.tumblr.com) a shoutout. They've got some great Q&A.",8,,1431812617.0,crbdhb2,False,False,1431812323.0,2015-05-16 16:38:43

Some questions from a prospective freshman undergraduate - would appreciate answers soon.,cdragon1983,"As far as prereqs of any type: Yes, EGR 191/192 completely stand in for MAT 201 and PHY 103.

As far as which to take, it's really a matter of what you're looking for: practical versus abstract, level of rigor, generic versus targeted towards a particular outlet. 

PHY 103 gives the pretty standard AP-like curriculum with a bit more math-intensive focus than most HS courses. PHY 105 is a more rigorous version of this, aimed primarily at people who could've tested out of taking physics but chose to take it at Princeton anyway. EMP covers the same material from 103/105 but in a different order, and borrowing just a bit of extra content from 104/106. 

MAT 201 is a standard, reasonably rigorous, take on multivar ... not much different from online courses or community college courses in terms of topics, just at more depth and with significantly more rigor than most HS/CC courses. EMP again covers exactly the same as MAT 201 just in a different sequencing in order to hit some of the material needed for the rocket lab earlier). MAT 203 is a very rigorous, much more theoretical approach to the material -- more appropriate for people with a background in proof-based mathematics, or at least a higher level of mathematical sophistication to be able to handle thinking about problems more abstractly. (And the research mathematics equivalents, MAT 21* courses even moreso ... to the point of not really being appropriate for engineers unless you plan on a very math-heavy track beyond just MV/LA or MV/LA/DiffEq)

Pickup Soccer?,rafiss,"There are often people playing soccer on Poe Field (which is on the south end of campus, behind Butler College) or on Alexander Beach (which is right next to Rocky/Mathey). You can usually just go ahead and play with them.

Joining an IM team requires no commitment or experience at all, and the games are weekly.

There is a Club Soccer group also. They have an A level which goes around to other schools' clubs and plays them, and a B level which is more for amateurs. Club Soccer holds practices 3 times a week and has games on the weekends. They practice on West Windsor fields, which is  off-campus, but easy to get to by walking south down Washington Road.

Course selection advice?,,"Hey, I'm a rising senior in CS. Here are my (super verbose, sorry) thoughts.

First off, if you have access to Score, use its course review system. Students are all required to either give feedback or explicitly decline giving it. Most people just go ahead and do it, so there's tons of good info.

Second, take 5 courses. You can always just drop one if you need more time to get settled in or to devote to extra-curriculars. I took 4 my first semester and it was too easy, imo. Writing sem is easy. I dunno why people make a big fuss about it. You only write like 3 papers, and the longest one is 12 pages or something. Then again, I like writing and am pretty decent at it :) (**Edit:** gf said writing sem is hard, said I'm a liar. This really varies a lot by person.)

Your perceived difficulty of MAT 201/202 vs. 203/204 vs. 215/217/218 will vary *tremendously* on your preparation and personal strengths. Same goes for PHY 103/104 vs. 105/106.

If you did AP Physics C, 103/104 will be very manageable. If you didn't do Physics C, the courses are challenging, and you'll be with a lot of kids with prior exposure, so it can be quite rough. It's a bit of a weed-out sequence. 201/202 are similar, but easier: many Princeton kids took multivar calc in high school, so they find 201 kinda easy. If you didn't, you'll be fighting against the curve, but it's not killer or anything.

MAT 203 and 204 are solid if you're good at math and want a challenge. If you're interested in rigor, I highly recommend them. Worst case is you drop down or you end up with a not-so-good grade (and nobody cares about the latter, I promise -- personal experience :)). If you're *not* interested in rigorous/formal math, they're not too worth it other than as a stepping stone into CS theory. I took MAT 201/204, and 204 is easier than the intro CS theory course (340), so it was nice to have. Not necessary, though.

MAT 215 is brutal. Take it if you're serious about hardcore math love. Even so, one of the saddest things about Princeton is that many people who like math are not good enough to take courses in it. I'm one of those people. It sucks. If you're interested, though, try it: dropping a course is easy, so it's *always* safer to over-schedule than under-schedule.

PHY 105/106 are solid if you're good at math and got a 5 in Physics C. Brutal, but lighter than 215 I hear. If you want the rigor and challenge, go for it, but it won't help you in CS unless you want to sharpen your skills for theory.

CS tracks don't exist at Princeton, really. We're the most flexible CS department I've ever heard of. You just take 2 theory, 2 systems, 2 applications courses, and then 2 more in whatever you want. Free to select which courses in each of those categories. (PS: CS is awesome at Princeton. Good choice :))",5,,1312964717.0,c2bemw2,False,False,1312961117.0,2011-08-10 02:25:17

It is very tough, especially for your first semester of college, and I do not recommend it at all.  The intro math and physics classes have some shitty teaching but you just have to deal with it.  Make friends to work with on both, and definitely go to review sessions for MAT 201/202 with Adrian Banner.  He's amazing.",2,,False,c2bb366,False,False,1312928386.0,2011-08-09 17:19:46
Course selection advice?,,"MAT 215 and MAT 217 are likely to be quite different from the math you've taken in high school.  Rather than focus on getting concrete solutions to particular problems, you'll have to prove various statements.  However, even if you haven't already taken proof-intensive math courses, you can still start with MAT 215; I hadn't taken such courses before, but writing proofs came quite naturally to me.  I think introductory analysis is an easy subject to grasp because everything you study will be familiar to you, as the discussions will simply center around functions of one real variable and their properties.  That's not to say that all the things you'll prove will be trivial, but that there won't be any significant barriers to conceptually understanding what's going on.

On the other hand, MAT 217 can be considerably more difficult.  You'll study things that you can't conceptualize as easily, if at all, and must simply accept in a more abstract manner.  For example, given a linear transformation T from the vector space V to the vector space W, you might prove the [statement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank-nullity_theorem) that dim(V) = dim(im(T))+dim(ker(T)).  This isn't really something you can ""see"" the way you can see, say, the [mean value theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem).  Similarly, you can't ""see"" that any linear operator can be put in [Jordan normal form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_normal_form), but you'll have to use that fact several times.  As such, MAT 217 is likely to be more taxing than MAT 215.  But, as a corollary, it can also be more rewarding, because you'll do things that you haven't considered before.  Metaphorically, MAT 215 is like reading literature in you native language, while MAT 217 is like reading literature in a foreign language: neither is intrinsically more difficult, but one certainly comes more naturally to you.

That said, I think you should pass on MAT 215 and MAT 217 the coming semester, as the professors assigned to those classes may not be particularly good.  If you have a chance to take MAT 215 with Sarnak, you should definitely take it; I took MAT 217 with Pandharipande, and he wasn't bad, either.  Also, if you want to learn something in class, never take a course with Conway.  In general, though, younger professors don't have as much experience with teaching, and can be a mixed bag.

As far as PHY 105 is concerned, I don't think I can offer any good advice.  I took it, but didn't pay much attention and received a C+.  Among other complaints, the professors aren't particularly good (although Petta is OK) and having to do labs is really annoying.  Still, the material is interesting, and if you're one of those people who gets the ""hang"" of physics, it could be a breeze for you.  The math used certainly isn't very difficult; the problem, at least for me, lay in trying to convert a physical situation into mathematical formalism.  But if you can do that, you'll probably love the course.

Course selection advice?,redandshiny,"COS 217 is fairly time consuming, even for those who are familiar with programming. Writing seminar can be fairly time consuming too in terms of research and edits depending on what class you end up in.

I'd totally recommend a freshman seminar - pick a weird interesting one, or one with a trip! I picked my major (geo) based on an amazing frosh sem I took. In fact, to plug the geo department, all their freshman seminars are ballin and go awesome places and have great professors.

PHY105 is no joke. I took this for 5 weeks before conceding (I needed to sleep) and even PHY103 isn't a walk in the park, but it's much easier than 105. Many of those who take 105 are very experienced in physics and especially with more proof-oriented techniques of understanding physics. MAT215 is similarly very demanding - I would recommend you take a few weeks of these two classes and you'll get a great feel for how difficult they are. I went in thinking I could do both (I'm decent at math/science) and found that I struggled immensely and was very miserable in both, but switched and did very solidly in MAT201/2 and PHY103/4. Only you know can what teaching style is best for you - I just don't have the brain for that sort of proof oriented learning.

I would highly recommend not taking 4 classes the first semester. Honestly, you should be spending some time getting to know people and trying to meet as many people as possible. Freshmen become way less friendly by 2nd semester because lots of people have already found what they think are their permanent 'friend group' (generalization but mostly true in my experience).

As for COS, generally people take COS217, 226 (both reasonable in terms of workload, you just have to plan and use your time well) and then my friends took 333 and made a baller iphone app. I don't know much about the other electives.

Also, I mean you haven't REALLY made your decision yet, right? You're a freshman. There's tons of wiggle room in there. Don't feel like anything is final yet, you're just beginning an awesome journey! Sorry for the sappiness, but it's totally true. I'd give anything to do those 4 years over again. Enjoy Princeton!

I took the integrated math/phys course. It was MUCH harder than the normal track, from what I've heard from my friends. Don't even think about taking it unless you've had AP physics. There are benefits to taking it: better lab, getting to know 30 other engineers really well, but...not worth it IMO. You have much more homework that is harder. Like, it is just empirically harder. 

In terms of taking the honors physics or math classes, it depends on your background. Have you had lots of physics and/or proof-based math? If not, I wouldn't take them, unless you are really motivated. The 201/202 and 103/104 is pretty nice b/c there's lots of help out there for those classes, like McGraw Tutoring Center in Frist (free peer tutoring/help on psets)

What advice would you have for a Sophomore Europe who wants to apply to Princeton?,aci_elle,"I think it’s great you’re taking the IGCSEs and are actually thinking about the SAT from now. As far as I know, IGCSEs and A-Levels are considered a part of your application, so, yes, they do carry weight. As for the SAT, I believe you would be able to get a really high score if you practise really hard. That goes for any student, American or otherwise. 

It’s also really good that you’re picking up languages. Is that your hobby? If so and you’re particularly passionate about it, be sure to explore it as deeply as possible. It’s best for you to have around 2 extracurricular activities in which you delved deep, rather than have 5 or 6 with only surface level experience. Also, Princeton loves well-rounded students, so if you find some extra time on your hands outside the scope of those 2 super important ECs, don’t be afraid to try new things and get a taste of everything. 

If you’re interested in Physics, try to get some experience in that field. Join a school club and participate in competitions. Take a local college course. Do a research project. etc. And if you do one of these things, try to excel as much as possible in it.

Don’t worry about not being able to catch up. I am a future Physics concentrator from Saudi Arabia and I went to a school that followed the Saudi national curriculum, meaning that I had to learn everything in Arabic and had no external examinations such as the IGCSEs or IBs or APs or anything else to account for my education. I didn’t have any higher level classes, and the curriculum I studied is not nearly as advanced as the American or European curricula. I still managed to get a very very decent score on the SAT through rigorous practice. I focused on my music and on a club I founded at school and made those my main extracurriculars. As for Physics, I read a lot of books for entertainment and worked on research projects in the field. I used those projects to participate in the national science fair in Saudi then went on to participate in ISEF.

Point is, if I was able to do it from an awful school with a substandard education, I’m sure anyone who works hard and knows how to go about the college admissions process would have a solid chance of getting in. 

Best of luck to you! I wish you all the best.

Pre-med at Princeton!!,liv12394,"Princeton alum here,  well aware of premed culture at princeton and outcomes for premed students from princeton. Not an expert but just trying to help, anyone else can feel free to correct me:

&#x200B;

1. I'm not completely sure what the opportunities are but it is hard to keep up with internships/shadowing on top of the class workload. Most students start volunteering in high school and spend some time on weekends and summers logging hours for volunteering.
2. Yes, it is. They did away with the official grade deflation policy but it is something that is ingrained in the culture at Princeton. Classes are very difficult and competitive ESPECIALLY in premed classes where students are cutthroat and GPAs suffer as a result. From my understanding because of the lower GPA it is actually harder for an ""average"" Princeton student to get into a top med school VS a stellar student at a lesser known school. This is because there are (unspoken) quotas as to how many Princeton students a med school can admit per class (usually 1-2) and unless you were the very best of the best, the chances are unlikely. Med school admissions are a mystery but I'm pretty confident in this.
3. HPA does their job to inform you of the steps necessary to be able to apply to medical school, BUT they will be frank with you about your chances because they know the issues some pre med students have because of lower GPAs. They will discourage you to continue on the premed track if they are not confident you will make it because it skews their numbers or ""success rate"". I always thought this was kind of fucked up. However, it is necessary to maintain a relationship with them because they need to write you letters of recc sometimes. 
4. I am unsure of this, although since you'd have a student visa, I don't think this would be an issue during undergrad years.
5. I was surprised at the amount of people I saw taking a gap year (or two) between graduation and applying to medical schools. Most do it to gain some experience (for example, working at a hospital or lab) before applying. Some did it to study for mcat . Some did it for both. Then there were a few very rare students that took the MCAT their junior year, applied senior year, and went off to medical school the fall after graduation. I think its a personal preference. Medical school is becoming increasingly competitive and personally I think a gap year or years has the potential to make an applicant more attractive. Plus, two of my best friends took gap years to study for MCAT and ended up scoring in the 98th percentile.
6. I don't doubt that most premeds do end up getting into medical school but I suspect that most do not get into their top choices, ((which I assume to be either other ivy league med schools or Johns Hopkins, Stanford, etc. )) These are just assumptions though. I think the Princeton premeds with stellar GPAs and MCATs made it to their top choices which is a difficult task because at times it seems like Princeton does everything they can to lower your GPA.",12,,False,exfkv46,False,False,1566242779.0,2019-08-19 14:26:19

Pre-med at Princeton!!,mixed_recycling,"I'll add my perspective bit. Medical schools know about Princeton's GPA issue. They don't consider a 3.5 at Princeton and a 3.5 at [college] as equivalent. When I applied just after they technically got rid of deflation, there was still a letter going out to schools explaining the grading policy. And, it's not like you're the only kid from Princeton applying.. schools aren't stupid, they know your GPA will be deflated because you are coming from Princeton.

Gap years are typical (I took one). The biggest reason I saw is senior year grades are typically better, so they help boost the GPA. Secondary reasons were experience or academic requirements. Also, personally, I feel it's a good thing to have some real world experience before med school, even if it's only a year, but that's just me.

I did not think HPA was very helpful, however I also did not feel that they were particularly discouraging, as the other commenter mentioned. If you are serious about premed, and if you get into Princeton on your own merit, then you'll be fine.

And, I'd agree that most students do not get into their top choice, but I don't feel that's a Princeton problem... In general, most students do not get into their top choice. It's a numbers thing. But on this note, I have two more things to add: it's hard to tell if you would be more successful if you went somewhere else, but the answer I think is it's a possibility (higher GPA definitely, more of a big fish kind of thing). The other thing though, is Princeton is an amazing place in and of itself, which can get lost in these discussions about being premed. So consider whether college is a means to an end, or a place you really want to take advantage of.

Anyway, feel free to PM.",6,,False,ey1gl5a,False,False,1566699107.0,2019-08-24 21:11:47

"In your opinion, how conservative is Princeton?",Jaesarynn,"Princeton is definitely more conservative than most other Ivy League schools, and this is where the phrase ""Even Princeton..."" comes from. (It references that when *even* Princeton is doing something, then it must really be a problem.) I wouldn't be too concerned about this kind of thing though, because the idea that Princeton is more conservative rises more because Princeton students are often slow to activist actions like protests and the like. I've never heard of anyone being ostracized/excluded because of any aspect of their life style on campus. 

However, in response to some of your other concerns:
Princeton's interest in the fine arts often manifests itself in the groups around campus that perform for the students, therefore they do tend to be more performance-based. For example, the dance groups on campus may hold occasional workshops which anybody can attend, but their main focus are the performances that they have throughout the year.

Re: housing — mmm interesting. I wasn't a huge fan of the OGC/NGC myself, so I had that as my back-up option. They do seem okay, but I'm tired of dorm life lol. Hopefully things work out in our favor!

Also woah a math camp :-o I wish we had cool things like that in CS. A placement exam and some math background checks sounds very indicative of a rigorous program!

Wilson Revisited: What the presidential portrait left out,Riot101,"Well written article. Definitely worth the read no matter what side you're on.


Personally, I knew very little about Woodrow Wilson when I was a student only a few years so. Obviously, I knew who he was and his role at the university, but beyond that he was just a stuffy old white guy who, like a lot of the stuffy old white guys at Princeton, had buildings named after them. In the last year, when the ""politically correct extremism"" started up at colleges, I was happy to see that it wasn't happening at Princeton.

I'm all for equal rights, treatment, and opportunity, but there is a difference between protecting and sheltering. I support protecting others from prejudice, bias, and racism, but the fact that these students got bent because some old white guy, who was instrumental to the ascension of Princeton to what it is today, is commemorated for his role is ridiculous. No one wants to remember him for his racial views. That's not why the paintings are up. But because it's trendy to be PC, these students have made being PC into an extreme sport.

If we are all fair and equal then why not have a white men group on campus? As a white male, I do have to deal with problems that are exclusive to white males. I'm not saying these problems are worse or more frequent. Getting into a fight over who's problems are bigger is counterproductive and irrelevant. But I am saying that if the point of these groups is to give people the ability to go somewhere they can feel comfortable and safe, then I think everyone deserves to have a group on campus. Or one could make the point that having groups divided by race is just going back to a form of segregation.

I'm writing this on my cell so I'm just going to stop there, but I'm genuinely interested on what people have to say. I'm open to being convinced that changing the name is a good idea, but honestly, I think this is an over adjustment.",2,,False,czlpb83,False,False,1454460982.0,2016-02-02 18:56:22

Third, research,
- Yes, we don't have a Medical School, but Princeton is unmatched in our undergraduate focus. It is far easier to get into a lab here instead of competing with Masters students, PHDs, MDs, etc. Yes, we still have higher degrees but our ratio is tiny compared to Yale and Stanford.
- Also, every student (except engineers!) completes a thesis and 1-2 other independent projects. If you're worried about not doing enough research, don't be. Princeton requires it.

Otherwise, there's an IKEA in North Jersey that will deliver stuff for a flat $100 fee, so if you can go with a bunch of people and ship it all together, that's nice.

#2 Most first years live in the grad college, where meal plans are required.  Be thankful you've evaded them, because they're expensive and not very good IMO.

#3 Most grad students have bikes or cars, and the shuttle is pretty nice.  There's usually a shuttle that comes every 20 minutes during the  school year.  I take that in pretty much every day, but on nice days I might walk back.

I am visiting Princeton!,alifeofpossibilities,"Welcome! I'm a current junior at Princeton. Some recommendations for your time on campus:
-Take a tour. I'm not saying that just because I'm a tour guide, but also because it'll help you get an idea of what's where on campus.
-Try to see a student performance of some sort. Ask at the ticket office in Frist what's going on this weekend (I honestly don't know). Note: some of the plays are a little raunchy (they did The Producers a few weeks ago), so if your parents are very straight-laced, they might not like that.
-Eat at Hoagie Haven. Get a Sanchez. It's a beautiful thing.
-Kind of random/cool thing: if you get a chance, visit the Particle Physics Lab. It's a little off campus, but it's a cool place, and most students never take the time to check it out. But I think you have to sign up in advance for the tour.

Needing Advice,stdtm,"Whether or not you should apply is a question only you can answer. 

That said, a good first step in figuring this out would be taking a look around the school's website. Are there majors/concentrations that you find compelling? Classes you'd be excited to attend? Faculty you'd be interested in learning from?

I'm assuming you're in high school - it'd be a good idea to talk to your guidance counselor or a teacher who knows you well about this too - they can inform you better of what exactly to expect, how to prep your application materials, and what aspects of your background/experiences to emphasize. The application itself isn't a huge amount of work, but you do have limited time and resources to devote to the college application process, and its important to use them wisely.

Hey guys! A few questions from a high school senior!,NonstandardDeviation,"I majored in physics with some work in the astro department, so if you have any particular questions about the department or classes, feel free to ask.

AST204 is a good overview introduction to the field, which may be very easy if you're already a fan. Beyond that there are departmentals like cosmology and star formation, which I didn't take. Many of the requirements are in the physics department, and quantum (PHY208), statistical mechanics/thermo (PHY301), and electromagnetism (PHY304) are all well-taught fairly enjoyable classes. AST301 General relativity was not taught well when I took it, so I recommend maybe taking the physics department version, PHY523, if you desire.

The department in general has a friendlier air than the physics department proper. Sitting in on morning coffee (at 10am, IIRC) or afternoon tea-and-cookies chats (3pm) can be informative about the field in general or the department culture if you can make it while visiting. Opportunities come with the connections, and many professors collaborate all over the world with CERN, Berkeley, etc. For example, a friend went to the Atacama to work with ALMA, though I think that was officially through a University global internships program. You may want however to work with the physics department, depending on the classes you wish to take and particular subjects - for example, Professor Lisanti works on dark matter phenomenology and IIRC microlensing searches, while Staggs and the gravity group work on cosmology and microwave telescope surveys.",2,,False,e6mv0u4,False,False,1537910562.0,2018-09-25 16:22:42

Grad school/preprofessionalism?,brownwhiteandblue,"Princeton PhD student here. No, Princeton's grade deflation will not hurt your chances. If you go here, you're already distinguishing yourself to potential grad schools. The faculty members are pretty good about mentoring undergrads, unlike in other top universities, and the junior and senior year research projects will be great chances to show off your research chops. I find that the undergrads here do some pretty impressive research. Other than that, you'd want to do well on your GREs and get some kickass recommendation letters for your application. 

What might be harder is the social culture of the place. I don't really know how ""preprofessional"" the undergrads are, since I don't interact with them much, but as I understand it they're extremely focused on getting private sector jobs. A lot of the eating clubs, for instance, are partially tailored around developing professional networks. But I think you can definitely find some folks who are interested in other pursuits. At the very least, you should certainly take PhD level courses by your junior year just to get a feel for it, and to interact with grad students on their way to academic careers. But I would say the most important thing is to look for a question about the world that you deeply care about, because grad school can really drain the hell out of you otherwise. I didn't have the best undergrad grades myself, and worked freelance for several years. I never thought I'd end up in PhD program, but I landed here -- and love it! Good luck with your applications!

* Physics 1 and 2 (103, 104). 5 on both APs skips both, miss either and you have to take both
* Chem 1 (201 or 207). 4 on AP chem skips it
* COS 126 (placement by conversation, requires much more than AP-level experience)

You are additionally required to have a mix of humanities and social sciences, but more flexible than AB

AB requires one or two courses from each of quantitative, science, ethics/moral values, history, literature/arts, epistemology/cognition, social analysis, and additionally foreign language through 107. Only foreign language is skippable with AP.

As others mentioned, unless you have chem, physics, and math placement, you'll have a fairly specific freshman year: 2 math, 2 physics, 1 chem, 1 cos, and writing sem is 7 of 9 courses. You can put the intro econ courses (100 and 101) into those spots to get started on Econ (if you didn't take AP Econ), but then you'll be missing foreign language if you switch to AB Econ.

AB requires 31 courses, but 4 semesters of independent work are not included so it's really like 35 credits.

You will most likely not take more courses than you have to, I think that's mostly wishful thinking as the required number of courses is rigorous enough as is. 

As an ORFE, I don't think that ORFE is necessarily more math intensive Econ. In my four years I've never taken an Econ course here. I think its better to think of ORFE as a specialized type of math. 

If you're interested in mathematical economics, you can tailor an ORFE experience to that, but I think math-track Econ plus a few ORFE courses would be more appropriate.

If you want to make friends with underclassmen, take a 101 level language class in something tough like Chinese or Korean. That's how I became friends with some grad students. It's also fun to learn a language here.

Underclass party scene is simple: pregame in a dorm from 10-12, go to the street (prospect ave) to the eating clubs from 12-2. Terrace lets grad students in usually. Thurs and Sat are the big nights. Friday is less exciting.

Frist Campus Center has stuff like late meal (like late lunch and late dinner) where a lot of people go.

I have been with PNC for awhile and have been very happy with it, but I haven't really heard of major complaints with any of the others. The ATM in the Wa and in the U store by Blair Arch were both PNC. However, the ATM in Frist was one of the other ones. I think something else to consider is whether any of them are more convenient around your home or where you are planning to work if you know.  Hope that helps.

I've been banking with with PNC for a few years now and have only had one issue (which was eventually resolved over the phone). PNC also reimburses ATM fees and they do accept cash deposits. However, you need to keep a minimum balance of $1500 (or meet other requirements) to avoid a monthly fee. 

Charles Schwab is a national company so you would be likely to find a location in any major city you travel to, where as PNC only operates in the eastern half of the country.

Visiting Princeton.,tk1451,"If you're looking for a quick tour, I prepared this for a friend of mine who was visiting the campus over the summer. It skips over lower stuff, including the athletic fields and two underclassmen housing areas (Butler and Whitman), if you're looking for a more in-depth tour you should definitely check those out. Other members will probably point out various historical inaccuracies or such in this guide:

http://i.imgur.com/mp8iHCH.jpg

Things you go past (in order):

Spelman (white buildings): There’s a Picasso sculpture in the courtyard on the south side of this. We think the university tried to hide it because it’s ugly but you can’t turn down a gift like that haha

Pyne/Henry/1901/Laughlin: These are dorms that we refer to as the “junior slums” because juniors tend to get stuck living there, because it’s far from everything. 

Blair Arch: This is famous. You can’t miss it. From the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s the train ran right up to the base of the arch, so it was the first thing people saw when they came to visit the town or the University

Alexander Theater: This is sort of our secondary theater (McCarter, at the start of  your tour, is the main one) but it’s much more architecturally interesting.

Witherspoon: This is our oldest dorm building that’s still in use. Completed sometime in the 1870s

Nassau Hall: Even more famous than Blair Arch. Served as the Capitol building of the United States for a bit, was occupied by both American and British forces during the revolutionary war, the Americans fired upon it and ended up decapitating a portrait of King George (woo symbolism!), according to legend it was motivated in part by the artillery commander’s son being rejected from Princeton. It’s the only building on campus that’s not handicap accessible because it’s on the national register of historic places so they can’t make major structural changes. There used to be a tradition of members of the senior class climbing the bell tower to steal the clapper from the bell. Someone fell to their death at some point, and so the university removed the clapper permanently.

Chapel: Take your chance to check out the inside. It’s pretty cool. 

Woody Woo fountain (courtyard on the north side of Robertson): Lots of drunk kids go swimming or climb the fountain on certain nights. So named because Robertson houses the Woodrow Wilson (Woody Woo) School of International and Public Affairs

Sherrerd/Friend Center/Engineering Quadrangle: These are all relatively new buildings that were built after the university decided it wanted to beef up its engineering game in the late 90s.

The grayed-out buildings on Prospect Ave: These are the eating clubs.

Frist Campus Center: I have you come around to the south side of this so you can sort of look out onto the southeast stuff and also because the south side is the one that shows up on the House intro (the hospital House supposedly works in doesn’t exist so they show our campus center and pretend it’s a hospital). Used to be a physics building, in the northeast corner they’ve kept the lecture hall where Einstein lectured more or less untouched and it’s still used for classes.

Prospect Gardens: This is where people meet up to take pictures before formal events and stuff. Good place to just sit and read a book too

Art Museum (end): Our art museum is pretty famous, it’s probably the #2 cause of tourist visitors (behind Asian parents who want their kids to go here). Several Monets and Warhols among other things.

If you drop Integrated for some reason or another, there will probably be no difference.

Ferry House, Mediterra, Witherspoon Grill, Alchemist and Barrister, Mezzaluna, etc. are all overpriced restaurants with average food. 
2. For good junkie and quick food, Hoagie Haven is good. Panera and Subway are good and reliable.
3. Olives is moderately priced and delicious. Sells sandwiches that aren't seeping in trans fats. 
4. For ice cream, you can't go wrong with Halo Pub or T Sweet. Bent spoon has great gelato. Fruity yogurt has good froyo and bubble tea.

Good pizza is nonexistent here. Maaaaybe Magma pizza if you're willing to wait forever for a pretty delicious pizza (very thin, but not super-crispy crust, pretty great sauce, great topping combinations if you stay away from the Spice Market--try going there for lunch/dinner instead of delivery)

There's also a pretty big hole (pun intended) of delicious bagels, but Einstein Bros. is pretty great, and Panera works in a pinch.

Sakura Express is great for cheap, pretty fresh (never gotten food poisoning after years of meals there) sushi. Get the Chirashi, no Mackerel (a good 2lbs of fish & rice) and they'll probably figure out who sent you, haha.

There was a really cheap tailor that did pant hems for only $8, but they closed. Let me know if you find a good tailor.

There's also a Five Guys 20-25min away (go to the one off of I-295), and buy a motorcycle while you're at it and go to PA/the mountains behind Princeton off of Rt. 206). Go run along the Delaware or Lake Carnegie.

* Keep walking past Mediterra and Mezzaluna not much to see there (Mezzaluna is the better, but still only so so Italian).
 
* Witherspoon Grill has the **best** burger.  Totally worth price.  Shortribs are good too.
 
* I've yet to have a bad meal at Teresa's, but I don't visit it as often as I used to. 
 
* In Kingston (right outside of Princeton on rt 27) is Eno Terra.  I visited nearly two years ago and had sausage platter and it was great; expensive, but great.
 
* Triumph has good food sometimes.  They change the menu so often I've given up ever enjoying consistency.  But a lot of the food is good.  The beers are really good, but after a while you realize they all taste similar.  The house flavor stands out too much.  Fortunately this house flavor works great for the stouts and a few other styles.

Hey Tigers! Moving to the area (Plainsboro). Need to know what's good.,SIGNW,"[WARNING: started off as a quick review, then turns into a review of almost every restaurant in town--I've been to almost every restaurant in town. Some have been left off this list]

**Asian**:

Yeah, Sakura's udon soup was pretty bland.

Ajihei has a bunch of rules which don't necessarily affect me, but kind of ruins the atmosphere.
MoC MoC (next to Triumph--great food & beer) is equally fresh & expensive as Ajihei, but I like the atmosphere.

Soonja's was pretty good, but a bit greasy for my tastes.

Nassau Sushi isn't good, but they have Korean as well.

Hunan is delicious semi-real Chinese food. But if you want REALLY good/authentic Chinese food, go to Szchuan Garden, outside Trenton on Rt. 33

Thai villiage is OK, but try venturing out to Pho 99 on Rt. 27 sometime. Dine-in. DO NOT TAKE OUT.

**Indian**:

I'd say Mehek is my favorite for go-to Indian--their take-out is quite cheap and really tasty with great selection. They're not stingy with their rice if you dine in, too. (Protip--if you don't mind reheating food/having less selection, they have their food @ the U-Store for cheaper than at the restaurant. Also, more suited to students: if you have a membership to the Princeton U-Store, you get 10% off on food there as well).

Masala grill is probably the tastiest though--their buffet is really great, and dining in has always been fantastic. A little bit more expensive than the others though.

Tandoori bite was a bite bland.

Don't go to Palace of India/Tomo Sushi--Kalluri Korner (PoI prior to rebranding) was incredibly dirty (think cockroaches everywhere). The Mediterranean place next door is pretty good though. Tomo was bland bland bland.

**Medditeranean:**

I got food poisoning at Zorba's Brother (the diner/restaurant, not the hole-in the wall, which I think is Zorba's Grill--which has OK gyros that were good enough to satisfy my cravings and left my intestines in tip-top condition).

The new Mediterranean place next to Kalluri is pretty good. Satisfies cravings for Doner meat better, but a little bit more expensive.

**Italian**

Meh, there's a pretty good correlation between price & tastiness in this town. Massimo's pasta isn't that great, but good for a nice, sturdy slice.

Iano's wasn't that good.

Naked is a bit overrated (check out Domino's if you're gluten-free)

Out of the more upscale places (Medditera, Teresa's, and Mezzaluna), I'd say Teresa's was my favorite.

**Mexican**
(Because of the Hispanic population around town, this is probably my favorite type of ethnic food in town)

Chapin (near the cemetery on Witherspoon) is really delicious, grungy, and cheap.

Tortuga's is delicious, but only if you dine in. It's a far walk for students though.

A Taste of Mexico (Behind CVS) is about as good as Tortuga's (a bit less messy, haha), and although it's a bit pricey, it definitely fills that burrito/enchilada-sized hole in my stomach.

**Misc**

If you're willing to splurge, definitely go to Elements on Bayard, past the YWCA. God that was some good food--do the 9-course tasting menu if you've got a sturdy stomach (I did the Roman thing of vomming when I got back and proceeded to get obliterated for my 21st).

Witherspoon Grill is definitely pricey, but their tartare was fantastic.

Triumph has great beer and food (mmm...pork belly sliders and the ceviche)

PJ's--overrated pancakes, plain depressing pasta.

**ICE CREAM/FROYO**
Best for fancy-schmancy flavors: Bent Spoon (Blueberry Mango Sorbet)
Best for rich, delicious ice cream: Halo Pub (Chocolate Brandy Hazlenut)
Best for blend-ins: Thomas Sweet's (Cake Batter)

And there will always be the Twist vs. Fruity Yogurt debate. I have a slight preference for Twist, especially after they added mochi. FY is definitely better for Asian tastebuds though. Also has bubble tea a lot closer than Tiger Noodles.

**Epilogue**:

Visiting for an upcoming weekend...any suggestions?,moondance,"Hihi,

I work for the DBar. It's a decent place, but unless you hit a party night you're going to see either a moderate crowd + music on Thu/Fri/Sat or a rather quiet environment on other days. The place is super cheap (3 bucks for a shot/simple mixed drink, 5 bucks for a LIIT/cosmo/something like that, 3.50 for a Guiness), though. Some bartenders (eg. not me!) are pretty good at making drinks, some aren't, as we're mostly learning through it.

Out of places, Princeton has a lot of non-chain fastfood places. In fact, the only chain places you'll find is Panera and Subway. Check out Olives (great sandwiches and grilled chicken), Old World Pizza, Small World Coffee or Hoagie Haven (super cheap! 4 bucks for a hoagie). Triumph has decent beer/burgers. Ajihei has great sushi. There's a 20-25 bucks all-you-can-eat sushi place about 5 miles away called Sushi Palace.

Train is 1.5 hours to NYC from station to end. Costs 16.50 in each direction. Definitely worth it.

Princeton itself is slightly boring as it's a small, upscale, academic town. You won't find nightlife or many ""fun"" things to do, except a lot of expensive small shops.

What is the student/stress culture like at Princeton?,greyghoste,"Honestly, the stress culture at ANY school is what you make it. I took a year off of Princeton last year for a medical leave due in part to mental health reasons, and one of the biggest changes I made personally during my time off has drastically changed my experience at this school. 

A lot of people come into Princeton - any university really - completely unprepared to become the ""small fish in a big pond"" as it were. It's so common, in fact, that they have a term for it - imposter syndrome. Where people feel like they don't belong compared to their peers, that admissions made the mistake of letting them in, etc. A lot of people (usually freshmen) try to deal with this insecurity by trying to sound as smart as possible all the time - trying to prove they fit in not to others but to themselves. But this means that they end up overextending themselves by taking on more than they can handle, or they don't ask questions because they don't want to sound stupid, or they pick boring paper topics that are mind numbing to work through because they think the complexity of the subject will earn them brownie points. And honestly it's super tiring feeling like you have to prove yourself all the time. I had a very hard time freshman year because I definitely felt like I didn't belong, and on top of other things, I needed the time off to figure out if I even wanted to be at Princeton, or at college,  at all!  

Ultimately I took my year off and sorted through everything, and now coming back (as a sophomore) I'm a lot kinder and more patient to myself, and, believe it or not, that competitive atmosphere has completely disappeared from my life. It's a self -perpetuating cycle - students come in, feel intimidated by how smart and capable their peers are, and attempt to raise their own self-esteem by trying to outdo - or at least match - their peers, which makes other students feel like they now have to prove themselves.... Yeah it ain't pretty. And the true culture it isn't like that at all. But most of the ""competitiveness"" that you see in high academic schools is this exact cycle. 

I'm in a lot of typically ""freshman"" courses this year because I changed my major, but since coming back from my year off I haven't really experienced this ""competiveness."" Every person I've met here has been so willing to collaborate and help, to go to McGraw study sessions and do homework together, to answer random questions I have if I get lost in lecture. I've made a bunch of friends in classes, which was never something I did freshman year, but the only difference was me. 

So, ultimately my point is that from my experience, the ""stress culture"" found at most schools isn't so much used as a way to rank others as it is a way for us to rank ourselves in comparison with our peers. Don't participate and you'll find lots of people willing to help and collaborate. Feel the need to compare yourself to others, and you'll find a ""stress culture"" no matter where you go.  

Sidenote 1: Student attitudes aside, I'm overwhelmed by the amount of academic support the University provides for its students. They absolutely want you to succeed and give you as many tools as they can to make it happen, you just have to take advantage.

And first thing I'll say is everything depends on what you make of it and how you approach things as an individual. But personally, I found it to be highly stressful, but not very competitive. Students have self selected to be mostly type A and are used to success, so in that sense it's a bit competitive.

What is the best aspect of studying Econ at Princeton?,Proud_non-reader,"Not sure if you’re asking about Graduate and Undergraduate as they’re definitely vastly different experiences, but I can speak to my experience studying Econ at the undergrad level.

The best part is probably the access to professors that we get. Besides having some of our greatest and most well regarded professors teaching even very lower level Econ classes, the relative size of the schools and the faculty advising process for the mandatory undergraduate thesis makes the faculty much more in touch with undergrads than you would find elsewhere. Many schools delegate most UG education to TA’s or newer professors, and while that’s true at Princeton you’ll definitely find a faculty that’s much more accessible and open to undergrads than elsewhere.

That being said, I think most of the class experience isn’t too far removed from what you’d get at other comparable undergrad institutions (which is to say: excellent, but maybe not unique). Princeton is a bit small so some semesters (maybe one since I’ve been here and I’ll be graduating this spring) the course offerings are a bit limited. Otherwise though the classes are great, really nice balance of challenging and yet still practical and relevant, and it definitely is well respected by employers/academic in Economics.

Overall the best part about studying at Princeton is the people here. Everyone here is so smart and so driven, it seems that everyone has a passion even if it is outside of the classroom. That’s a really nice thing to be around and it really helps you find your own passion.

AP credit and course placement,Engineer1822,I would definitely say skip 103.  You might want to take 104 since Princeton is so rigorous.

AP credit and course placement,-NathanielC-,"In my opinion, it would be more efficient to use your AP credit as leverage in order to progress ahead of your game rather than taking unnecessary classes which, as they have assumed, aren't needed whereas they assume your AP Calc BC credit has allowed you to have enough insight to skip. With that said this is solely based on your outlook on your progression in AP Calc BC, how you think you did. If you feel you merited an adequate appropriation of the class, a good understanding, I would skip the class. The only thing I could potentially reason for as to why you shouldn't skip the class would be the potential gains from taking the class you would've skipped, 103/104. Nonetheless, pick multivariable Calc. if you felt you did sufficiently well in your AP Calc BC course as said above and have a mediated understanding or, if you feel the need to gain more knowledge(which may be unnecessary as you may have already attained it from AP Calc BC), you should take 103/104. Sorry, beforehand, for any unintentional repetition that may have sustained against my point. Reflecting on one of my first points: -as they have assumed, they aren't needed whereas they assume your AP Calc BC credit has allowed you to gain a further developed insight. The authorities of the campus, presumably the management, have developed an insight that AP Calc BC has sufficed enough insight to skip. With that being said, either trust your institution and the councils judgement or, on the latter, go for the path of 'more knowledge'. First option is more centric on long term, not short term gains- maintaining even a single skip of courses(103/104) could substantiate evermore leverage for your progression. Anyways, I hoped this helped you weigh your options out.

When I toured there, however, I was immediately taken aback by the overall attitude - the tour guide almost explicitly said that it was a live-to-work atmosphere with people putting in 80-90 hours of work a week. That she talked about being thankful for being overworked because it made her ""more employable"" almost sounded like Stockholm Syndrome to me. Granted, this was one opinion from one tour, but my uncle (who's a senior Electrical Engineer at a well-regarded technology firm) was also very taken-aback by the campus culture.


Granted, Princeton is hard work too, but it's in a liberal arts context - Princeton wants you to have time to do a variety of things that you enjoy outside of the classroom in addition keeping up with your (challenging) classes. Caltech certainly does seem to have a tight-knit ""geeky"" community that encourages making stuff outside of class (I did appreciate the amount of projects and power tools lying around in the quads when I toured), but Princeton has a lot more varied opportunities I think, and is less (at least in my opinion) stressful.


Last word - one of my best friends here (who is a physics major) got into Princeton and Caltech (and a lot of other Ivy League schools) and came here, so it's certainly not unusual to make that choice.

Questions from a HS senior,karbear23,"Hi. Alumni interviewer and recent grad here. 
As already stated, yes, Princeton admissions come out on the same day. 
I think the biggest thing any student applying to Princeton should know about is the very unique social scene. Princeton has what are called eating clubs. As an upperclassman (sophomore spring) you can choose to bicker (like rush for frats/sororities) or sign in to an eating club. If you do, then that club is where you will eat all of your meals junior and senior year and its where parties are at night. You will have one or two meals a week sophomore spring. You can also do what are called meal exchanges with friends who are in other clubs. Each club has a somewhat different feel and group of people so you will likely find a club that seems like the best fit (or just do what a bunch of other friends do)--a number of students also choose to remain independent, or not join a club, and love that too. The club I was a member of made my Princeton experience--that majority of my best memories from Princeton are of club events/activities with other members of my club. (I think it is important to note that all of my roommates were in different clubs, so your club is not necessarily your exclusive social group--it's what you want it to be and certainly adds to the fun). The party scene at nights is similar to frats and sororities, but the membership is co-ed. There are theme nights as well as club formals, semis, girls' and boys' nights, movie nights etc etc. The scene can be a little tough as a freshman, particularly if you do not know any older students, because for many of the clubs you need a pass or to be on a list to get in, but upperclassmen know this and often remember any trouble they may have had as a freshman and are usually pretty good at helping out if you ask. Also, as an underclassman, dorm parties are growing. That's a quick synopsis of the social scene, though certainly not all-inclusive. Of course there is much that can be said about the academic scene as well. Also, campus is insanely beautiful--I still thought that senior year on a regular basis whenever I walked out of my dorm.",7,,False,d00pl01,False,False,1455550811.0,2016-02-15 09:40:11

It was quite practical to transport as I drive up to campus, but even shipping it (along with any peripherals) isn't a major hassle.

I know only one person who has a desktop in their room so I wouldn't say its popular on campus at all. It just isn't very practical. A good laptop can do all of the things you suggest. If you really need a desktop there are computer clusters all over campus, you are never more than a minute from one. If you really need power for music production/video editing we have a special cluster in Lewis Library (science library) with really powerful computers just for producers and people who would need it.

If nothing else, I'd suggest leaving the desktop at home for convenience's sake. I really don't think you'll find much of a need for it and usually when I'm bored I'll socialize/go to the gym/eat. ",3,,False,chk4ryk,False,False,1400305101.0,2014-05-17 00:38:21
Desktop in Dorms Question (Incoming Freshman),betsu_ni,"I had a desktop in my room for my senior year, and I definitely appreciated having it.

It was also awesome for movies when I had friends over and gaming when I was feeling anti-social.

The only thing to watch out for is if you have roommates. If your room forces the desks to be in the bedroom, you can't easily move the desktop out to work/play on it while your roommate is asleep.

Your classes depend entirely upon your major. Engineers take relatively similar classes for the first year, while non-Engineers take a wide variety of courses, depending on their majors, free space, and interests.

In regards to dining halls, I recommend sampling each one and seeing what you like. As Shuck stated, your preferences will depend upon your location, spare time, and opinion regarding the food. Again, most people just eat wherever is closest to their dorms or classes during meal time. 

Also, I recommend going to late lunch and late dinner in Frist. The quesadillas are amazingly good, plus there's pizza and other food. You have a monetary limit for late meals, but you can still get enough to satisfy your hunger.

Research on Major Selection at Princeton,cdragon1983,"\1. [Admissions](https://admission.princeton.edu/faqs/#will-my-choice-in-course-of-stud-606) says: ""On the application we ask you to indicate the degree program (A.B., B.S.E. or undecided) and the departments that most interest you. These choices don't affect your chances for admission, nor do they commit you to a particular course of study. ""

\2. Not really, as indicated above your application materials don't commit you to a degree or major -- the stat at that link notes that >70% of students end up concentrating in something other than what they listed on their application. Your freshman academic advisor will be (roughly) assigned based on your indicated academic interest, but there's no requirement to register for classes or otherwise progress towards the major that you stated.

3./4. Engineers declare after freshman year. The freshman engineering curriculum is broadly the same across all of the engineering concentrations (progress towards completion of the 4 BSE math requirements, complete the 2 courses in the SEAS physics requirement, complete the SEAS chemistry requirement, complete the SEAS computing requirement, complete the University writing requirement). It is possible, even common, to be undecided among different engineering departments before (and even, to some extent, after) declaration.

A.B. students declare after sophomore year. Various departments have a few departmental prerequisites in order to declare, but students can certainly be undecided among a few departments up until the point of declaration. For ABs, it's harder to change after having declared a concentration, because in junior year they're required to write a JP (junior paper) each semester (whereas BSEs are not), and it's unusual (though not impossible) that a JP written for one department would satisfy the requirements of another.

\5. All I can go on is what they say officially, as noted in 1. That said, the University does seem to try to have engineers be ~1/4 of the class, and with the exception of COS, it's much more common to leave engineering than to join it, so that could make for some tricky yield/retention prediction calculus. Also, the University seems to aim for gender parity among engineers, so I could imagine that might have the smallest of impacts on admissions despite the official line.",1,,False,fyvqzxk,False,False,1595432497.0,2020-07-22 10:41:37

What advice would you give to a high school freshman looking to get into Princeton?,hypatiaspasia,"I'm an alum and I interview people every year. Honestly, there is no magical formula to get in. It's very unlikely for even an exceptional student to get in. It seems fairly arbitrary, TBH. I would encourage you to have backups.

All you can do is:

* Try to knock it out of the park, grades-wise. Basically everyone is a straight A student.

* Be very involved on campus or in your community. Strive for leadership positions. Even if you don't win, you lost nothing by trying.

* If you have an extraordinary ability or passion (like in music or the arts or robotics), try to really develop that. Keep track of the teachers who really like you, who can later write you glowing rec letters. 

Here's my high school resume from like 10 years ago (I never get to whip this out anymore): 

- Grades: I got like one B+ in Calculus (and boy I was traumatized), but otherwise all As. 

- Community involvement: I was VP of my class for two years. Head of the schoolwide event planning committee for two years. Chair of my section in orchestra. I acted in school plays for 4 years, ran track 4 years (although I was bad). I was also in charge of my mock trial team for two years. My senior year I co-ran a satirical, wannabe Onion newsletter that made fun of our school administration when it did shady shit. My school required some volunteer work, so I would help out at a non-profit that provided books to prisons.

- Extraordinary ability: My teachers singled me out for my creative writing, so that's what I ran with. (And fun fact, that is now my job!)

Each the people I've interviewed who have gotten in have been impressive in their own ways. One seemed very shy, but turned out to be an opera singer who had performed at venues around the world (she had zero other extracurriculars besides opera). One was really into science and aspired to be a doctor, but was also super into drumline. Etc etc. I've also interviewed VERY impressive people who I scored as Exceptional, who didn't get in.

Princeton has a wonderfully academic atmosphere with hard-working, intelligent kids. The professors are great, and because it’s a fairly small school, you get to interact with them surprisingly often. If research is your thing, there’s plenty of opportunities for that, and Princeton really helps you get internships, too.

A cursory search demonstrates his ideological connections to the far right, but since I wasn't going on an hours long journey to examine the primary sources, and that the quote on Hitler in the article was pretty snipped and devoid of context, I included those caveats.

A great GPA can't guarantee that you'll get in nor can a bad GPA (relatively speaking, obviously a 3.0 weighted probably would not get you accepted) guarantee your rejection.

2. I only did AP Chem and AP Physics 1 (algebra based) in high school and have done well in the calculus-based physics courses here so far, so that definitely should not be a problem

3. I don't really know what to say about extracurriculars other than that admissions officers usually look for a ""spike"" meaning that you have one or very few impressive and concentrated activities in areas related to your field of study or passion.  But I assume chess titles would help.

To get into schools like Princeton and Harvard, like /u/Engineer1822  said just really need to be great outside of the classroom.  Try to focus on activities targeted towards a certain field, and try not to do a bunch of smaller activities. But in the end, just do what interests you.

Grade Deflation?,andrewjw,"Deflation policy was abolished, but the other answer is completely wrong. Deflation has a strong legacy on campus: many to most departments curve only a bit better than deflation-era policy, and students are very aware of it. Maybe there are a few exceptions: the econ department, for instance, curves very aggressively. However, many intro-level classes (Physics, Math) still curve to a B or B+. This is part of what makes Princeton very hard, even compared to other Ivies. However, if you look at the trend, you will see that average GPA has been rising over the years: even though most departments still curve similarly to deflation-era, there is definitely an upward trend in GPAs as departments slowly start to inflate grades again.

Personally, I am actually not that upset about any of this. It's something people groan about a bit, but, as I said, I view it largely as self-repairing over time. Some classes should be curved to a B or B+ (some very large intro classes), but now classes which should curve above that do: most professors have a pretty good idea of what should happen and set their classes to that point.

This is a serious consideration when deciding to attend Princeton: do you want it to be hard to get As? If so, this is a great place. If you will be upset if you get below an A-, then Yale and Harvard will be a better fit.",8,,1461819040.0,d2kbw55,False,False,1461818602.0,2016-04-27 23:43:22

* There are some extended stay suites nearby for ~$100/day.
* tigertrade was helpful but I think I'd have had to look a little earlier to find a place that way.
* I ended up finding the emails of the housing staff by looking at the staff page on princeton's housing website - and they did get back to me the next day (although I didn't end up going that route).

"Hi r/Princeton, what do you really think about mental health at Princeton?",ardenriddle,"I've interacted with Princeton's mental health services a few times. Maybe my experiences can provide some insight. Or maybe not. But here they are:

#1

When I started at Princeton, I didn't really think I had any mental health issues. I'd had a panic attack once when I was in junior high school, but that was it. I had always breezed through my schoolwork, before college. I knew I was about to enter a very high pressure environment where pretty much everyone had been the top of their class. I was no longer going to be able to just automatically get straight A's.  I was moving across the country.  It was pretty scary. 

I had a really rough first semester. I'm an extrovert, and I had never really been in my own in a completely new place before. So I put myself out there. The first few months, I tried talking to classmates, sitting with new people at lunch... but I always left with the impression that I was boring people with my presence. I got into a singing group, but I realized I really didn't like the people in it very much. The only people who seemed friendly were the Evangelical Bible study group that we're trying to convert me. I was constantly being locked out of my room by my roommate so she could have sex with her boyfriend. I felt trapped. I was homesick. I felt like everyone else had no problem making friends. I loved my courses and was surprised to find that I was actually fine with the amount of schoolwork, but I was completely miserable outside of class.  

It got to the point where I would just start crying. It would just well up suddenly, and usually I could get to a bathroom before I'd burst into tears.  I knew this wasn't me. So I went to McCosh (the infirmary) and talked to a doctor.

She met with me once and I probably cried for 80% of my talk with her. I asked her if I should keep trying, or if I should just transfer somewhere where I had a support system in place. But she didn't give me advice. She just asked me more questions. (I realized only later that I should probably have asked a dean these questions, not a doctor). She said it sounded like depression, since it had been going on for more than 3 weeks at that point. She was probably right, but I knew it was depression based on my circumstances--I'd never had these problems before that. Nevertheless, she offered to put me on antidepressants. I declined. She asked me to come in again, but I never did. She recommended I take a ""mental health day"". And so I spent the night at McCosh and just hung out with the nurses for a while. They are super nice. But partway into the evening, I got really embarrassed that there were ""actually sick"" people in here, and I was going crazy. So I checked myself out, went home. 

The psychiatrist never followed up with me. My res college dean did check in with me, though, because my parents were worried about me.  I remember feeling embarrassed about that, but I guess I was glad to know that there was a support system there for me.

I flew home for Fall Break, and talked it over with my parents. My dad said to at least give it a whole semester. And I felt that was reasonable. I had an end in sight--if I was still miserable by winter break, I'd leave. He also said to quit the singing group and join something else. I felt bad, having committed to being in the group, and having taken up a spot that would have gone to someone else.  Well I'm glad I took my dad's advice and stayed. I ended up joining a different musical ensemble, where I meshed really well.  I made great friends that I'll have for the rest of my life.  Never had to take antidepressants. It always bugged me that she prescribed them so quickly. I'm sure I looked like I needed them, but still--is 30 minutes enough time to decide you should alter someone's brain chemistry?


#2

I did have a second, more helpful encounter with mental health at McCosh. My anxiety issues were exacerbated by the academic pressure at Princeton. My junior year, I had two anxiety attacks, and I went to the nurse. Talked to the doctor, who decided the best plan for me was to have a few sessions with a psychiatrist (but I only went once and then kept meaning to make another appointment and never did). And she also prescribed me a few anti-anxiety pills to take only if I ever have another full-on panic attack. The people I dealt with that time were really great and helpful.



---



So, I think that your experience at McCosh depends on your issue and it depends on the doctor who sees you. Some doctors are going to be better than others. Also, please know that you can talk to your dean and your advisor, if you don't think you want to talk to a doctor. And your professors too (depending on the professor). They've all been around academia for a long time, and they can probably help point you in the right direction.  That is what they're there for.  That may sound obvious, but I didn't figure this out until pretty late in the game. Dean Dunne is a wonderful person to talk to.

I do feel I should also mention that the urgent care and the women's health center are excellent.",5,,1403688598.0,cigjxb1,False,False,1403687688.0,2014-06-25 04:14:48

Looking for a schedule to ease into Princeton difficulty?  I spent my entire career here taking the easyish classes so you're in luck.

To start out, since you're very interested in computer science, I'd recommend COS 126.  It's our introductory course, though it is a bit on the tough side.  If you think it might be too much to jump into right away, start with COS 109, a good introduction to the field.

If you're going into engineering, you're going to have to take a physics course.  Most freshman get it out of the way in the first 2 semesters.  I'd recommend staying with PHY 105 rather than jumping straight into PHY 205; 205 is a tough class.

Since you're decent at math, I'd recommend MAT 215.  It's math from a different angle, and doesn't get stale like beginner MAT 203/204 courses do.  Plus, you get work with incredible professors who are the best in their field.  My professor was John Conway, creator of Conway's theory/game of life.

Because you're going to want a diverse schedule that isn't all quantitative, I'd recommend also taking your writing seminar this semester.  Each writing sem is different, but I'd choose one that contains a lot of reading.  It feels good to get your head in a book and away from math and science for a bit.

And that's an easy first semester!  Remember you have 4 PDF options in case you want to take a class Pass/D/Fail.  Use these for classes outside an area you are comfortable in.  If you have any more questions, just let me know!

Help with First Year,SlippySpeed,"Thanks! I'm looking forward to COS 126. Is there a difference if I take 103/104/201? Besides the workload? Does taking, say 103, instead of 201 adversely affect me/number of classes I need to take overall?",1,,False,chd5302,True,False,1399590214.0,2014-05-08 18:03:34
Help with First Year,Highdefhunty,"To clarify on these recommendations. PHY 103/104 are the typical 2 semesters of physics most engineers take. PHY 105 is goes more in depth, but is definitely more difficult.

Similarly, MAT 103/104/201/202 are the four math courses most engineers take. A lot of students (though by no means all) place out of MAT 103/104 with AP credit and take 201/202 (multivariable and linear algebra). 203/204 are the advanced versions of 201/202 and 215 is even more advanced. I have heard great things about the more advanced classes but trust me when I say that 103/104/201/202 are already plenty difficult and interesting.

Assuming you have no AP credits, you'll probably take PHY 103, MAT 103, COS 126, CHM 201, first semester as an engineer or some variant of it depending on what AP credits you have.

Thanks! I went to a really rural high school, and most of my classes ended up being online/virtual-- basically cutting out all the interaction. Because of this, I really miss working with people/teachers on stuff, and I'm glad you recommend that.

One of my concerns is that from what I can tell, I'm going to have a very short period of time from when I arrive at college to pick my first semester classes. I have a feeling I'm going to be under-prepared from my (pretty shitty) high school. The other comment was really helpful for classes, but additional input is also welcome.
