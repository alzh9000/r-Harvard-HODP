TheApiary,"Obviously you all should do whatever you want. But my unsolicited advice for you: unless you have some urgent personal reason you must start college this fall (outside scholarship that expires and can't be extended or something), take a gap year, and come in fall 2021.

There is a good chance that there won't be in-person classes in the fall. Nobody knows for sure, but it's pretty likely at this point and departments are preparing for it. Don't waste your tuition money on really overpriced webinars from Yale. Wait a year to come, and then get four full years of Yale. In addition, then you have a better chance of graduating into an economy that is one additional year away from this mess, which will probably better for your job prospects when you graduate.

I know you're excited about Yale, so the idea of sitting around at home even longer sounds shitty, but if you're gonna sit around at home next fall, you might as well not have it count against your four years at Yale.",Recommendation for all incoming students: take a gap year,101,0.93,gbkswa,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/gbkswa/recommendation_for_all_incoming_students_take_a/,18,1588377712.0,2020-05-01 19:01:52

I never ate alone, even in dining halls where I didn’t know anyone. Some Yalies would always take pity on me and invite me to sit with them. 

My hosts were amazing, but I found plenty of wonderful Yalies while sitting in common rooms or in classrooms or on park benches as well. Students would recognize the BDD bracelet on my wrist and introduce themselves to me and offer to talk to me about my major or show me around. 

Even more than being kind, every Yalie I met was thoughtful and non-judgmental, even when I was nervous and stuttering through the day. Not every conversation was about quantum physics or objective morality, but I walked away from every conversation having learned something new. Even better, I felt like the Yalies I talked to wanted to listen and learn from me too. 

I don’t know how many of you guys I saw out there, but I’m sure that all of you contribute to the warm atmosphere I felt on campus that cut through the New Haven rain.

Major changes (copy/pasted from President Salovey's email)

\-  When spring recess ends and through April 5 at the earliest, classes will be held using Zoom, Canvas, or other online tools. I know classes take many forms across the university, so this shift to online teaching and learning raises many questions. Deans will be communicating with their faculty and students to provide further details in the days ahead. 

\-  We are asking Yale College students to remain at home after spring recess. For undergraduates who are on campus now, please make every effort to return home as soon as possible, and no later than Sunday, March 15. Yale College Dean Marvin Chun will be providing additional details in the coming days. Undergraduates will have the support of the university in meeting their academic requirements remotely while at home. I understand that some undergraduates consider New Haven to be their home or cannot leave the university at this time. The Yale College Dean’s Office will provide separate instructions for these students, who also will take their classes online.

Graduate and professional students are encouraged to remain off-campus and participate in online instruction, unless required to be on campus due to the nature of their research or academic programs. More information is forthcoming from the deans of each school.

The university will remain open and continue to provide custodial and limited dining services.

She can't name whose house it is, not a single person has corroborated her story, there are no other accusers that have emerged after she came out. This is the epitome of reasonable doubt.

I really hope I don't live in a world where a completely unsubstantiated accusation from 30+ years ago can ruin someone's career. Am I saying she's lying? No. However, I'm not going to assume a man is guilty just based on one person's word, and I don't see how anyone else can either.

Considering the political demographics at Yale, I don't know how many of you will share my opinion.  I, for one, do not support Kavanaugh politically. To me, however, this isn't a partisan matter; it's a matter of the fundamental beliefs of our justice system. To allow this accusation to affect Kavanaugh's career is to weaponize any sexual assault accusation, even if it may be completely unsubstantiated.

One of them was admitted to Harvard as well. Yale probably isn’t looking great for him right now.

Dear YSM Faculty:

In follow-up to recent communications from President Salovey, Provost Strobel, and me, basic science chairs and directors convened today to discuss the meaning of critical or essential work in the laboratory setting. As the situation on-the-ground around COVID evolves, so must our definition of critical and essential functions in the laboratory.

As always, the safety and well-being of our students, faculty, staff, and patients are our priority.

At this time, examples of critical laboratory work include research on the causes and mechanisms of viral (COVID-19) infection; therapeutic clinical research studies; monitoring of the safety and efficacy of patients in ongoing clinical trials; testing of patient/research samples for ongoing clinical trials that cannot be paused; and other lab work that impacts the immediate safety and health of our patients and community. Preservation of precious resources such as cell lines or animals so as to avoid the disruption of months or years of work may also be viewed as critical, in which case specific team members should be identified to maintain these resources and complete critical experiments.

Investigators or lab members should not come to work if they are having symptoms, and all should practice social distancing. It is important to note that investigators can be very productive while working from home. Some have expressed concerns about the impact of decreased productivity on their life’s work and career development; please know that the university and YSM will be developing a policy to extend the tenure clock commensurate with the duration of interruptions.

More detailed information regarding human subjects research can be viewed here.

ElephantTusk37,"Posting from my personal account instead. I'm a 2020 Yale grad and working with over 20 Yale student volunteers along with 20 other students from across the country. We're called Ameelio ([ameelio.org](https://ameelio.org/)). Here's some press about us in [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90514321/this-app-bypasses-the-absurdly-high-cost-of-making-phone-calls-to-prison-by-converting-texts-to-snail-mail), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/ameelio-wants-to-take-on-for-profit-prison-calling-rackets-after-starting-with-free-letters-to-inmates/?guccounter=1), and the [Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2020/03/04/students-launch-prison-communication-startup/).

Last month we released our first app, Letters, which lets users sign up, type up a letter to their incarcerated loved one (in any jail or prison in the U.S), attach a photo, and then we send it off to get printed, packaged, stamped and mailed through USPS. We're doing this at no cost. I understand deeply the financial and emotional strain that comes with keeping in touch with a loved-one on the inside. That's why we're keeping this service free and unlimited (although we are now limiting it to 3 letters a day to save money).

What's the catch? There is no catch. It's completely free. A number of generous individuals and foundations are funding our operations.

I left college after my first semester and went straight for a traineeship in journalism, however I'm now wanting to go back to university to get my degree - specifically a Yale degree.

I've been looking to apply to Eli Whitney program since I've been out of traditional education for a while, and am eager to head to Yale. Are there any alumni on here who would be able to give me an idea about what the program is like etc?

How did you find the program, how did you find returning to academics? How affordable is it? One of my only concerns would be affordability as I know Eli Whitney Students have to live off-campus. What was your relationship like with others at Yale  - with both fellow students within the program and with students within the wider Yale community?

Wokyourworld,"Hi,

I was accepted tonight as a transfer to Yale!! I am very excited as when I applied the first time it was my first choice. However, I feel as though my life/ priorities have changed significantly since that point in time. I spent the past year on a leave of absence from my college pursuing my professional acting and recorded music careers, which have both made me happier than I've ever been. I decided to transfer from my previous institution because there was no artistic community / available courses in acting/playwriting/recorded music, and it was too far away from LA auditions (2-2.5 hours 1 way). I was also accepted to Columbia University (a school that I have more friends at and am way more acquainted with) and am now tasked with the difficult decision between the two. If I was at Yale, would I feasibly be able to continue auditioning in NYC with my agency and not have to put my career on pause for 3 years? At Yale, would I get stronger connections/ inroads to the industry than at Columbia? Stronger training? Additionally, I've heard nothing about people at Yale pursuing a career in recorded (pop) music. Is there a community of non-classical musicians/producers on campus?  Any advice is appreciated!! If you have any insight as to Yale's integration of transfer students that would be helpful too. Thank you, and sorry for the long post.

certainly is true at other institutions). Furthermore, I know that Yale offers world-class opportunities and resources quite unparalleled anywhere else. However, that being said, this article really has reaffirmed that Yale/Harvard/Ivies are really just a brand and a business, concerned about their public image (arguably) more so than the educational and intellectual growth of the student.

jameyj201,"Hi,

I was planning on going to Yale August 24th to quarantine because my state was on the high-risk state list. But, yesterday my state was removed from the list. I can now either choose to go on August 24th and quarantine in my residential college or arrive after the quarantine period (first week of September) and move into my college then. I would only choose to quarantine to meet new people (not sure how realistic that is though) and start my classes at Yale. If I stayed home I would have an extra week or so to say bye to family and friends and start classes remotely at home. I am also not sure if the quarantine period is going to be horribly boring with nothing to do. Is anyone else in this same situation? If so, what are you planning on doing? Any advice is appreciated :)",Do I Quarantine Voluntarily?,22,0.96,i8mqz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/i8mqz6/do_i_quarantine_voluntarily/,3,1597296760.0,2020-08-13 00:32:40
EliWhitneyApplicant,"Hey guys, hope everyones doing well with the world ending and jazz. Today I got an email from the Eli Whitney Program team about setting up an interview in a few weeks (Zoom, of course). I was just seeing if you guys have any advice as well as answers to a few questions. 

&#x200B;

First off, how much stock should I even be putting into the fact I got an interview in the first place? I want to be excited because, from what I've seen, they handpick people for it but I can't find a good source to confirm that. 

&#x200B;

Secondly, what would the 'tone' of the interview be? I did one with Harvard a few days ago and it was a really friendly interview with a pretty wide range of questions (personal life, background, academic/non-academic interests, future plans, why 'X' school, etc.). Is it safe to say it will be pretty similar? 

&#x200B;

Third, in my spare time, I read a LOT of works that have to do with the topic I'm hoping to major in (Global Affairs) and I try to stick to respected scholars and publications. I'm honestly just a massive nerd for the subject and I enjoy reading about it constantly. Assuming that it's something relevant to the questions being asked, would it seem too 'try-hard' to bring this up? I really am the type of person who uses their free time to read books by academics, but I don't want to talk about it if it makes me come across as inauthentic or that I believe that I know it all.

&#x200B;

Fourth, what are just some general pitfalls people often fall into or things they tend to omit that they should have emphasized more? Or really, just any advice in general, unironically I don't know shit so I'll take any wisdom that comes my way.

&#x200B;

I'll try my best to outline what I see to be the advantages and disadvantages of Stanford vs. Yale in Academics, Student Experience, and Career Outcomes as they relate to my interests and goals- please correct me if you disagree with any of my assessments and lmk if you have relevant info/experiences!

**Academics:** *I am interested in Analytic Philosophy and CS/logic. Right now, I think I want to study both of these fields in college, but I am very open to exploring new areas.*

* Obviously, the overall quality of education is pretty much the same at both of these schools.
* Stanford’s strengths and resources are tilted towards STEM, while Yale’s are tilted towards the humanities. The majors I’m interested in at each school are Symbolic Systems at Stanford and Math + Philosophy at Yale. Both of these programs seem like they leverage their school’s institutional strengths well.
* At Stanford, it looks like it’s much easier to get a master’s degree with your bachelor’s in 4 years, which is something I would like to do. (thinking of Symsys BS with CS coterm)
* At Yale, it seems easier to double major than at Stanford, which isn’t too important to me, but I would want to do this if I can’t get a master’s degree.
* Both schools have grade inflation, but it looks like inflation is more prevalent at Yale.

**Student Experience/Culture:** *I grew up in the south and attended high school at an elite prep school in the northeast. I'm looking for a new, exciting college experience that pushes me to challenge myself and grow*

* Stanford has better weather and a more exciting location in SV. A lot more appealing to me than crime-ridden, cold, economically depressed New Haven
* Yale might have a friendlier, more open social scene due to residential colleges, as opposed to Stanford, which I’ve heard is cliquey.
* It seems like Stanford is less elitist/stuffy, which I see as a refreshing departure from my high school experience.
* I feel like I might fit in better socially at Stanford as an Asian dude who's not from an elite family.
* My impression is that Stanford's culture is more pre-professional than Yale's, which I appreciate.
* I don't like how Stanford seems very STEM-dominated, especially as someone whose primary interest lies outside of the natural sciences. Yale seems to have more diversity of academic interests, which I like.

**Career Outcomes:** *I’m not sure what I want to do as a career, but I’ll probably either go into Consulting/Tech/Finance or off to Law School (like most people at these schools lmao)*

* Name Brand- virtually the same overall (will open most of the same doors), but my impression is Stanford fares better on the west coast and internationally, while Yale’s brand is stronger on the east coast.
* It seems to me that Stanford, being a younger school, doesn’t have the same deep roots that Yale does in fields dominated by old money / HYP, such as Wall Street and Politics
* Yale’s network is stronger in Wall Street, Government, and Law, while Stanford’s network is stronger in High Tech, VC, and Business.
* Yale’s alumni are largely concentrated in NYC, and Stanford’s alumni are mostly in the Bay Area. I can see myself working in either area.

Overall, I think Stanford and Yale will serve me equally well academically and in my future career. Based on the school cultures/expected student experience, I'm leaning towards Stanford right now b/c of its better location, more down-to-earth students, and the exciting prospect of moving away from what I'm used to in the northeast.

I'm sure I made many incorrect statements and am missing many other dimensions to consider- please correct me and share your relevant info/experiences!",Please help a conflicted prospective student to decide: Yale vs. Stanford,19,0.88,g7c8iv,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/g7c8iv/please_help_a_conflicted_prospective_student_to/,6,1587777035.0,2020-04-24 20:10:35
jamesstern01,"I am currently in the midst of college decisions. I surprisingly got into Yale, and USC with other safety schools also. USC has always been a dream of mine and I love the work hard/ play hard atmosphere with the weather also. I applied to Yale as another reach school and found out I got in, in early December. While USC has been my dream, Yale seems like an opportunity worth pursuing for me. I’m not quite sure what I want to major in and Yale better caters to that IMO. It seems that Yale somewhat lacks school spirit and the social scene compared to USC but I want to give it a try for at-least one year. If I decide to transfer after a year at Yale, how likely would it be for me to be able to transfer to USC? Or in general, is it difficult to transfer out of Yale into another top university? I think I will love Yale but if not I want to be able to have a back-up option.

kshelley,"To the Yale Community,

In the hours since Provost Polak, Vice President Goff-Crews, and I wrote to you yesterday evening, we have continued to work closely here on campus, and with colleagues at other U.S. universities, in response to the executive order signed by President Trump on Friday. As you are no doubt aware, the order provides the following:
For the next ninety days it blocks entry into the United States by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen;
For the next ninety days it appears to bar individuals with valid visas and even green card holders from those countries from re-entering the United States unless exemptions are granted;
For the next 120 days it suspends entry of all refugees to the United States; and
It bars Syrian refugees indefinitely.
We are alarmed by this executive order. Together with many others in and beyond the Yale community, we question the motivation underlying it and recognize that it departs from long-standing policies and practices in our country. All of us are worried for colleagues, friends, and family members who may be affected by these and other changes in immigration laws.

American institutions of higher learning are united in their distress on behalf of our international students and faculty, and in their reliance on our communities’ most fundamental values of accessibility and open dialogue. Our educational mission and the welfare of our community members are directly at stake. National security is of the utmost importance, but we are steadfast in asserting that this goal can be achieved while maintaining respect for core academic—and American—values. This is why Yale joins with the Association of American Universities (AAU) in urging that “the administration’s new order barring the entry or return of individuals from certain countries...should end as quickly as possible.” We support the AAU’s call for the United States to continue “to welcome the most talented individuals from all countries to study, teach, and carry out research and scholarship at our universities.”

Our Office of International Students & Scholars (OISS), in consultation with legal counsel, has recommended that Yale students and scholars from the designated countries (including dual nationals and U.S. permanent residents) suspend plans for international travel without first consulting OISS or an immigration attorney. Staff in OISS have reached out to Yale students and scholars from the seven countries affected. The office will also be hosting open meetings for the Yale community on Wednesday, February 1, and Thursday, February 2, from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. More information is on the OISS website and will continue to be updated regularly. I know that a number of the deans also have reached out to their students and faculty, and that several gatherings of support are planned for this evening. I am grateful to see the many ways that our university community is coming together in response to this assault on our values.

Our campus includes more than 5,000 international students and scholars from 118 countries; they are part of the very lifeblood of this university. I reiterate here our commitment to the safety, well-being, and vital place at Yale of these international scholars and students, the members of our Muslim community more generally, and others who may be affected by Friday’s executive order. Not only do immigrant and international students and scholars contribute to our university, they contribute tremendously to our nation. Those who choose to stay bring new ideas, skills, energy, and cultures. Those who choose to return home foster goodwill toward the United States abroad. Today, we at Yale join our voices with all those who are calling for swift reversal of these measures that undermine our university’s—and our nation’s—core values.

It's a stand-up show featuring me and 3 of my super funny buddies who have each been doing comedy for 5+ years in NYC. Each comic will do between 15-20 minutes. If the venue permits, I would love to turn the show into a monthly with three different acts each time.

I have tickets for sale, but the truth is that I'd just love for you to come to the show and have a good time, so if you message me I'm more than happy to waive the cover. Making money is great and all the ticket-money does go directly back to the comedians, but, frankly, we just want to have a really good and fun show and keep working on our acts.

I have an eventbrite and Groupon deal up, and, of course, if you want to come for free, just message me and I'll add you to a guest list. We already have an audience of 25-30 people, but would love to get even more in attendance.

Thank you for your time,

I have not had the opportunity to physically visit any of these campuses (but really hope I will before the reply deadline). From what I have researched thus far, Yale seems to be a better community fit for me, but I want to learn more about academics from a student's POV.

The academic opportunities at Princeton are keeping me away from choosing Yale. I am a first-generation Mexican-American interested in political science, from a grassroots and community-oriented POV. In essence, I love to study minority politics, identity politics, political theory, theoretical underpinnings behind legislation, liberation ideology, colonization, culture, etc. I am considering Grad/Law School, but do not have a clear path yet, so guidance for figuring this out would also be vital for me. I simply know I want to use my education to serve underrepresented communities, whether it be by representation or direct action.

From what I have looked into Princeton, the Woodrow Wilson School seems like an extremely good match for me, but I connected more with the student orgs I have read about at Yale and the social issues of New Haven. This is also very important to me, as I know I want to use my grassroots experience from home at my future school.

I have good grades, but no professional experience so unsure whether I'd get in. I would also need significant financial aid.

I'm interested in the social sciences side, anthropology/sociology of the environment and political ecology (especially with migration).

(Math, Science, Lab, English + maybe an extra interesting class) or take a CS class in replacement for the Science + Lab. Which combination of courses for my first term might you recommend?

I’ve also been told don’t take more than 4 courses your first semester so I wanted to ask about the rigor of a science + lab. From my understanding, a science course and the lab that it goes with are technically two separate courses, so would it be equally rigorous as taking 2 courses? If I choose to just take the fundamental classes, should I drop the 1 interesting class from my schedule? I know my first term I’ll not only be getting used to the rigor of Yale’s courses, but also most likely having to take them online. 

CS class wise, I’ve had decent experience with Java and Python (the latter I did way more further back so I’m v rusty in), took AP CS as well which was a pretty easy class for me.

I’m hoping to do a phd after undergrad, and am especially interested in QFT and string theory. I recently noticed that Yale doesn’t really have any relativity (only intro to special in 410, and no general) courses for undergrads. MIT + other schools seem to have a general relativity, as well as an intro to string theory, course for undergrads, and I was wondering if entering grad school without these would be an issue. 

Should I consider ditching the double major and trying to take grad-level physics courses to make up? Is this fairly accessible and/or commonly done? 

On the other hand, I’ve heard many math classes - complex analysis, topology, differential geometry, partial diffeqs, Lie groups, functional analysis - are recommended/essential for theoretical physics. I’m also curious about the “math for physics” courses, could these supplement or replace any of the above to make room for grad courses?

The resources I'm currently aware of are the local screenings, which are great, but my friends are never interested in 'em so I just go alone.

I came across on article from the YDN in November said that 43.5 % of seniors live off-campus.

Amoxi,"Hey everyone, I am currently a prefrosh trying to decide whether Yale is right for me. I want to major in art or computing and the arts at Yale, but all the people I've messaged about it are not very good at responding. 

I want to know whether Yale's CS courses are doable for people (like me) who have never done CS before and how the professors are regarded. Additionally, for anyone studying art at Yale, I heard from a Stanford faculty member that  graduate programs do not like to take students from the undergrad program. I really want to attend Yale School of Arts, but if I go to Yale for undergrad, would that lessen my chances? 

Yale does have a great arts program, but it's mostly for graduate school. I talked with an art undergrad student and she said Yale is not great for undergrad art studies. Additionally, when I was there for BDD, there were no visual arts clubs at Yale. I'm between Yale and Stanford and I don't really like one over the other. I might choose Stanford since the students there say that the CS courses are very doable for people who have never done CS and I could double major (or minor) in art practice, but I want to give Yale a chance since it was my first choice.

linakbae,"I'm an international student in South Korea (no US citizenship). I'm currently a junior.

I want to ask about the atmosphere at Yale since it is near impossible for me to actually visit American colleges regularly. This is going to be somewhat long, so bear with me, please!

I'm not sure what I want to major in yet, but currently, I have an interest in medicine and want to become a doctor (pathologist) someday. My counselor is recommending biology. However, I also love writing, doing research and studying non-science subjects, such as comparative politics and literature as well. I genuinely enjoy every subject I take except for Korean history. Students like me have trouble studying in the Korean curriculum because, starting from sophomore year, Korean students are forced to pick either a science curriculum or a non-science curriculum. This is the main reason why I wanted to study abroad.

I got the idea that even though Yale offers great science courses like MCDB, it emphasizes the arts and humanities. I yearn to take courses in literature, writing, and perhaps politics as well when I'm in college. Schools like MIT, Caltech, or Princeton, even though they are absolutely amazing (no doubt), doesn't really seem right for me because they are more science-orientated. Also, I'm tired of competing with everyone I study with. The Korean education system is extremely competitive, and kids fail to go into the college of their choice because they make a mistake or get one more question wrong in their school tests. This causes enmity and exasperation for everyone. I don't mind a little competition, but I want to study in an environment where people are willing to help each other and are less competitive or greedy.

First of all, is the atmosphere I'm picturing above accurate? If not, which schools in the US fit this picture? This is really important in making my college choice.

Second, does Yale care less for the science students compared to the humanities?

Third, Does Yale offer a lot of research opportunities for science majoring undergrads? I'm asking this because lots of US unis tend to focus more on graduate students.

Last, a lot of people say my ethnicity give me an advantage because lots of Asians have good stats. I have no idea if this is true. Based on your experience, what is an acceptable stat for an Asian female Yalie?

Only two people have gotten in Yale in our school so far, and it is depressing every time someone says nobody can go in because we're Asian. My current stats are sat 1540 (math 800, lang 740), Math 2 800, and three 5s for APs (comparative politics, psychology, micro). Straight As so far, and I am the top of my year. I took bio last weekend, and hopefully, it will be an okay score. I'm retaking SAT I this december. My stats are low because I starting considering studying abroad, and moved to an international school this February. Are my stats THAT BAD?

We do, however, plan to host more AMAs in the future! Follow us on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, or sign up on our email list, to be notified of when our next AMA will take place.* 

MindMap is a New Haven based public education campaign hosted by the Program for Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP). We provide free, local and effective treatment for people who may be experiencing psychosis, as well as support for their families. We are a collaborative program of the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services and the Yale University Department of Psychiatry.

Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. Symptoms can include hallucinations, delusions, increased distractibility and withdrawal.

The goal of our campaign is early intervention. We want to spread awareness about the early warning signs of psychosis, so that people can receive help as soon as possible. First symptoms of psychosis most commonly appear between the ages of 18 and 24, the majority of fist episodes occurring between 13 and 30 years of age.

With this new semester starting, we wanted to give the Yale & New Haven communities the opportunity to ask any questions that they may have about mental health, psychosis, symptoms or treatment. Please leave your questions here and I will be back to answer them. I look forward to chatting with many of you!

I know Yale has had a bit of issues with students moving off campus, so I'd like to hear your opinions, especially on the new colleges.

2. How's the food? I've been looking into the dorm food and it seems kinda like there aren't too many options-- for those in a college without hot breakfast, do you manage? Is it easy to get to a place with it?

3. How are you doing without Commons? I am especially interested on a first-year's take, as y'all seem to have missed out on quite a few traditions (like the holiday dinner).

Subject: Candlelight Vigil Sunday at 6PM on Cross Campus in Support of Refugees and Immigrants

Dear Deans and President Salovey—

I'm writing on behalf of a group of faculty, students, and staff that have been organizing over the past three months in response to the new political situation in the U.S. On November 10, we brought together over 1,000 people from around the university at the law school to strategize and consider the ramifications of the election of the week before.

As our next event, we are hosting a candlelight vigil in support of refugees and immigrants tonight at 6PM on Cross Campus, in front of the Women's Table, and Sterling Library. We're asking people to bring a candle and also consider attending a benefit for IRIS—Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services—that starts an hour later, at 7PM in Battell Chapel.

We hope you'd be willing to spread the word, so the Yale and New Haven community can stand together tonight in support of our friends, colleagues, relatives, and others who may be hurt by the new Executive Order.

As a Berkeley College grad, a GSAS grad, and now a faculty member, Yale has been my home for almost a decade, and I've learned that we are a family that takes care of one another in times of crisis.

Regards,

Gregg

,"So there are some very questionable web sites, promoting stories that Eric Braverman, who teaches at Yale has disappeared due to his role in the Clinton Foundation.

[This link is just one example](https://stream.org/the-mysterious-disappearance-of-former-clinton-foundation-ceo-eric-braverman/)

Yet [this link seems to imply that he is currently teaching a course at Yale](http://som.yale.edu/eric-braverman).

Does anyone have any firsthand information on whether he is really missing or not? I have no connection to Yale, so I really have no way to easily check. God forbid of course, that any of the ""alternative media"" would actually just call or go by and look for him and settle the issue.

So has anyone heard these stories, and does anyone know if he is actually teaching currently?","Eric Braverman and the Clinton Foundation theories, does anyone have any actual information?

SquirrelPhotographer,"Recent grad (from another Ivy, if that really matters) to work at YNHH by the end of this month. I am looking for a safe and affordable place to live on an entry-level salary, and I won't be bringing a car (though possible a bicycle). I've been looking through craigslist, but I'm having a very difficult time navigating through which areas around Yale I should be looking at and which areas will have a decent commute.

**Important:** I am a female in my early 20's who has never spent a night in New Haven. My job will require me to pick up some *evening and night* shifts, so safety around the apartment and ease of commute are of utmost importance!

**Questions:**

* How can I search for housing as a non-student?  Everything seems to need a Yale email address or a Net ID.

* Is there a grad student listserv I can join without an email or Net ID where people post apartment listings and room openings? (I feel like this is more trustworthy than craigslist)

* Any people who use public transport to get to YNHH, where are good places to live along the bus line? (the ""O"", ""F"", and ""B"" bus lines look pretty good, but more detailed info about where along these lines to live would be appreciated)

* Know of any room openings among your buddies?

* I already know that New Haven is a tough city and the area around Yale, I assume, is much safer than other parts of the city. Can somebody speak to the safety around YNHH, since I'll be there during evenings and nights?

* Any additional info would be appreciated (e.g. ""You definitely need a car."" or ""It's hilly, so noob bikers beware!"")

I've developed a web app called Vailable ([https://vailable.io](https://vailable.io)) that is pretty much a better when2meet.

I'm a grad student and member of one of the grad schools at Yale. I've noticed that Grad Schools - or at least my one - seem to socially distance themselves from the rest of the university, which is fine, but I was actually hoping to join a club or two to meet people with similar interests beyond my academic study. I don't mind if they're undergrads or other grads (I'm still very early 20s), but I was keen to join some clubs for my interests. 

Thing is, I imagine the undergrads are all exposed to new club/fraternity/social opportunities across the university, but the Grads definitely aren't. There are some specific clubs I'd be really interested in joining, and I'm not sure how I can go about getting on that before it's too late.

I’m a moderator of /r/ApplyingToCollege. We’re a community that is dedicated to assisting high school students through the process of applying to colleges. We do this through a combination of the help from high school students, college students, and university admissions officers, as well as a few private consultants and university faculty.
 
I’m currently working on a project to expand our wiki and give the users of the subreddit a better idea of student life and academics at different schools and I would love to hear your take on student life at Yale.
 
This is the first time our subreddit is working on getting profiles of a school in this manner; we’ve previously had posts on the subreddit, many of these were in pro/con format, but that is not required. Feel free to write in whatever way best suits you.
 
Here are some Pro/Con ones if you’d like to see previous examples: [UCLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6339ds/ucla_pros_and_cons/) [Berkeley](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63avr2/uc_berkeley_pros_and_cons/)
 
But a response like [this (Dartmouth)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/62z66y/my_dartmouth_experience/) or [this (Duke)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/62qeyy/reasons_why_you_may_dislike_duke_a_memoir_from_an/) is also acceptable.

If you haven't seen user flair, check out an [AskScience thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jesn0/are_unprofitable_but_effective_cancer_drugs/).

\- What's the curve like in general and what grade is reasonable to aim for? (I know that it varies for everyone but if anyone has any firsthand experience that would be great)

\- Are there any academic resources for econ (office hours, campus tutoring etc.) that proved to be helpful?

Husky_In_Exile,"Hi /r/yale. I will be joining your university in the fall for a PhD. I previously asked about accommodations on this subreddit, and I received some good feedback.

My question now concerns finances. At the moment, I will be receiving a ""minimum"" of $29,000/yr. for my stipend, with the possibility of additional funds for the summer. A few questions:

What is the tax situation in Connecticut? As I understand it, I will pay 5% of my income (single) along with $300, so $1750 in state income tax per year. I've also calculated about $4,600 in federal income tax. Together, this is $6,350 per year. Are you paying similar rates?

If my calculations are correct, this will leave me with $22,650, or about $1,900 per month. This is honestly a bit discouraging. The rents are expensive in New Haven, and along with utilities and internet, I imagine this will eat up AT LEAST $1,000 of my budget. Add in $450 a month for food, and I am left with $450 for all other expenses, including textbooks, insurance deductibles, etc. I also don't think there will be any time to work, as the PhD seems very intensive.

PhD students, how do you get by? Any tips to make your dollars go further in New Haven? Could you find any supplemental work tutoring, shoveling snow, working a library desk, or something of the sort? I don't want to own a car or take fancy trips or anything, but I would like to put a couple hundred aside every month in case of an accident or something similar.

Thanks in advance.

pwnsnake,"Hi Yalies,

I'm seeking a second moderator for this subreddit, to take over for me by the end of the semester.

A bit of history: A little over a year ago the [College Subreddit competition](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/08/grow-college-subreddit-competition.html) brought myself and a bunch of other Yalies into the subreddit. I took over as admin because the creator, [lmaocookie](http://www.reddit.com/user/lmaocookie), was nowhere to be found. I applied a bit of custom CSS and set up a flair system (the college, major and year next to some usernames here).

My day-to-day duties (more like week-to-week, because this is a quiet subreddit) involve checking the spam filter and responding to moderator requests, including requests for flair. This is the minimum that a new mod would have to do, but if you have ideas for subreddit-wide improvements that would be a plus.

If you'd like to be considered for moderator status, send me a [PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=pwnsnake&subject=Moderator) or [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23yale&subject=Moderator).

7deadlypins,"Hey everyone, prefrosh here. I understand that it might be a bit early to ask this but I wanted y'all's opinions on 2 of the preorientation programs (specifically FOOT and Harvest). First, do most people go to one of the preorientation programs? 

I heard FOOT is the most popular and that it fosters very intimate and long term bonds, which I love. It also sounds super fun. The bad thing is that it costs a bit and I won't get financial aid to cover it, and beyond the upfront $460 i would also need to purchase most of the equipment on the packing list (even though they say to just borrow things, no one I know is a big fan of hiking, so I can't).

I am willing to foot (no pun intended) the cost of FOOT if it is truly worth it over the other programs. 

On the other hand, it seems like Harvest is less popular. I've heard less about it and I don't even know the costs associated, but I love taking care of animals/animal husbandry and I'd love to experience farm life. I don't know if it fosters the same intimate connection that FOOT does though. 

Can someone outline the pros and cons of each program/share anecdotes from people who have attended them, and possibly give me a recommendation as to which program I should choose? Thank you!!! 💕

seacucumber3000,"I'm an undergraduate computer science student who'll be applying for master's programs this coming application cycle. Yale is currently on the list of programs I'm looking at, and I wanted to get any input here about the program before applying!

I know many in CS poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons I'm happy to get into if asked, I'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

My interests in CS lie primarily in machine learning (more because I have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security. If any of you are CS graduate students involved in these fields, I'd love to know your experience with the program. If not, I'd still love to hear your thoughts. 

Yale being Yale, I'm a little concerned about how master's students are treated as opposed PhD students when it comes to academic mentorship and opportunities. I've hear horror stories (not necessarily from Yale, but from similar big-name CS schools) of PhD advisors. I'm also coming from a ""no-name"" state school, and I'm a little intimated by the Ivys. Are my fears overblown?

For context, here are the other schools I'm looking at (and a fair warning, this list is way too long and part of the reason I'm looking for feedback is to help trim down this list): KTH, ETH Zurich, EPFL, Stanford, University of Michigan, CMU, Princeton, Cornell, Penn, University of Wisconsin, University of British Columbia, Oxford University, Cambridge University, Harvard University, McGill University, Kings College London.",Why Yale for a CS master's?,6,0.88,i9bh8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/i9bh8k/why_yale_for_a_cs_masters/,7,1597392470.0,2020-08-14 03:07:50

Pretty much 10/10 videos or blogs I have seen about people who got into Yale has completed this. I would love to study at Yale, as a a App. Math and Music student. My conductor went to Yale as well and went to the same high school as me. However, he is a LEGENDARY cellist, and had already knew Yale people. My school is not known for academics, as we have no AP courses, no honor courses, and is located in Vancouver Canada. I think my conductor is the only guy in my school that went straight to an IVY. He graduated in the 90's but the competition would still be tough back then. Pretty much everyone I've seen get in has accomplished something HUGE, or is super prestigious by their junior year in something. 

I know the cliche would be ""be yourself"", but from doing ""intensive"" research, the ""be yourself"" for many people who got in is pretty much all the things I described above. I self learned AP Calc and Phys in my sophomore year as I wanted to continue math but my school didn't offer it, I started a chamber band club which is turning into a official government approved class next year that counts for grades, I started a robotics class at my elementary school, I do orchestra and piano, volunteer at a elementary band, I am currently taking second  year math courses at a university, (currently in my junior year), and I am working on a math paper and do musical compositions as well. 

I am doing all that I love and striving to follow my dream which is to give back to the community as best as I can in every step of my life, and I know that many people say ""thats what matters"", but so far, everyone I see get in, has ""Eagle scout for 6 years"", or ""self-learned 20 APs with all 5s"", ""grew up in a poor abusive household and managed to win and lead international math olympiad"", ""working at local hospital"", or ""won 3 world-wide science fairs in a row"" or something on those lines.

NapMcDonald,"Hi all,

I'm an international from the UK who has just moved into Yale. 

I wanted to ask some questions to the community, so thought I would pool them concisely into one post - I hope that's OK! It's a bit of a leap starting up in a new country so these questions might sound dumb, but I just want to make sure I get things right.


1) Is there a good place to buy a bicycle? Ideally a decent second hand bike would be fine. But I'm not sure where to look, particularly for second hands. 

2) Which provider has best phone signal in Yale? I'll mainly be using data for everything (if not Wifi), and I'll mainly be in New Haven, NYC, or Boston for the next few years. So I'm looking for consistent good phone data, and not too pricey. 

3) What bank could people recommend to set up a simple checking account, just to move money in, use it to pay with a card (debit), take cash out, and occasionally receive money? I've seen Bank of America's everywhere - are they user friendly for a simple checking account?


Thanks for all the advice, and sorry if it's all a bit obvious - everything is strange and new for me and your advice is much appreciated.

alprasnowlam,"Hi guys! I'm an incoming freshman hoping to place out of intro Bio as I've heard the intro class is massive and the material annoying. I've also heard that the placement test is extremely difficult. I reread the Barron's AP Bio book, but apparently much of the placement test material goes beyond the scope of the AP curriculum. How should I go about studying? Thanks!

EDIT Post-Exam: This may have been the most ridiculous exam I've ever taken. The test questions are completely unrelated to the topics the module ostensibly covers. Which isn't to say the questions, if you can even call them that, are difficult conceptually. The content is standard, but the questions just cryptic and meaningless. Often they just make a vague assertion and the impetus is on you justify it. But there's a 2 sentence limit (yes, that's a thing--as if longer, ie. 3 or more sentence, answers are wrong), so you better hope that you read the grader's mind and those 2 sentences were *exactly* what they were looking for because you only get one shot. This whole test is basically an exercise in just Googling random specific things (not necessarily even related to the course material) quickly such that you have enough time to summarize the answer stated explicitly on some random Wikipedia article from 12 sentences into 2 to adhere to the sentence limit and sufficiently obfuscate the content to avoid plagiarism. 30 minutes to do 11 unrelated, arbitrary Google Search summaries, no biology expertise evaluated whatsoever.

To the members of the Yale community: 

An executive order signed by President Trump on Friday restricting the entry of individuals from seven countries into the United States may affect members of our community. We share in your concern regarding this situation and assure the community that we are working closely with students and scholars who are directly affected.

We are also in touch with our colleagues at other universities and the Association of American Universities (AAU), of which Yale is a member. The AAU has issued a statement urging a quick end to the administrative order barring returning students and faculty from certain countries, available here. We will continue to monitor the situation and to explore the best options available in response.

Fylla,"Hey! I'm pretty excited to be starting grad school in the fall at Yale, so I was curious what are some of the most popular (or useful) websites students use here.

I'm coming from UWaterloo, so to give you a sense of what I mean, we've got:

/r/uwaterloo Way more people & active than this sub, pretty much sums up the school.

[OMGUW](http://omguw.com) where people anonymously complain, write missed connections, ask questions, etc...

[WatTools](http://wattools.com/) where there are something like 50 student-created apps and extensions to make UW life less frustrating

[Imprint](http://uwimprint.ca/) Our weekly newspaper, not very prestigious or well-read (or well-written...).

[mathNEWS](http://mathnews.uwaterloo.ca/) I think it's like the Rumpus but with math and comics instead of the beautiful people and sex?

[fuckyeahuwaterloo](http://fuckyeahuwaterloo.tumblr.com/) A blog devoted to positive/pretty things about UWaterloo

[Students of UWaterloo](https://www.facebook.com/StudentsofUW) Humans of New York but about UW. 

[kijiji](http://kijiji.ca) Because craigslist up here is all sketchy escort ads.

fullbloodedwhitemale," For the [**sixth semester in a row**](https://www.middletownpress.com/news/article/Yale-says-sexual-misconduct-complaints-increase-14456597.php), sexual misconduct reports have gone up at Yale University, [**double the number**](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/) from spring 2017.

And the Yale official responsible for compiling the report seems to regard these rising numbers as a positive development.

“We are hopeful that the increase in complaints reported to the University is an indication that our community is more aware of and more frequently accessing our resources,” Stephanie Spangler, Title IX coordinator and deputy provost for health affairs and academic integrity, told the [***Yale Daily News***](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/09/20/sexual-misconduct-complaints-doubled-since-2017/)*.*

Some of those analyzing the [**recent semi-annual report**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Sexual%20Misconduct%20Report%20Jan-Jun%202019.pdf) are skeptical of the high numbers, however, largely due to the broad definitions for terms such as sexual harassment and sexual assault.

With 169 claims filed from January through June alone, the Ivy League school would have a “much higher violent crime rate than any of the nation’s most dangerous cities” if the report is to be believed, Brooklyn College Prof. KC Johnson, who chronicles Title IX enforcement at colleges nationwide, wrote in a recent analysis.

The broad definitions have real consequences for students’ rights, according to Samantha Harris, vice president for procedural advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

“By giving the impression that the university is a hotbed of violent sexual crimes,” she told*The College Fix* in an email, “a broad definition like this fosters the type of climate of fear that has led to the wholesale abandonment of due process in campus sexual misconduct adjudications. It also trivializes real sex crimes.”

Yale did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls from *The Fix* Oct. 8-14, asking for its response to Johnson’s analysis of the report, published in [***Minding the Campus***](https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2019/10/04/is-yale-more-dangerous-than-detroit/).

***‘Counseling’ is the common response to sexual misconduct***

Johnson is a [**recurring critic**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/yales-latest-report-on-its-sexual-misconduct-investigations-shows-more-curiosities/) of the so-called Spangler reports. He noted that despite the huge number of reported cases, “only five sexual assault cases were adjudicated” during the most recent six-month period.

Four of the five accused students were found guilty, yet the punishments – including short suspensions or probation – “suggest the actual offense was far less severe than the commonly understood definition of sexual assault,” he wrote.

Johnson also pointed out that Spangler has “removed more and more details from her reports” over the years, including details of “third-party reports involving anonymous alleged victims and accused students.”

The report, released in mid-September, is the 16th since 2012. It covers sexual misconduct reports to Yale Title IX coordinators, the Yale Police Department, and the [**University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct**](https://provost.yale.edu/uwc/procedures) for the first six months of the calendar year.

The half-year report, like its predecessors, “illustrates the danger of lumping everything from groping to forcible rape under the umbrella term ‘sexual assault,’” said Harris, whose work with FIRE concerns issues of free speech and due process on campus.

“If one reads the report, one sees that the university commonly responds to reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault simply by ‘counsel\[ing\] the respondent on appropriate conduct’ — including in response to reports of penetration without consent!” she told *The Fix*, highlighting pages 10 and 11 of the report:

>If counseling respondents is truly the university’s response to rape, that is grossly inadequate — but what I suspect this actually reflects is the university’s use of an ambiguous and confusing “affirmative consent” definition, under which sex is not consensual unless there is “positive, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement to engage in specific sexual activity throughout a sexual encounter,” which must be re-affirmed for each new sexual act and which can be “revoked at any time.”

Harris argues that definitions such as these are “likely to engender a great deal of confusion among participants in sexual encounters.”

After New York approved an [**affirmative consent law**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/law-professors-line-up-against-new-yorks-new-campus-sexual-assault-law/) that applies only to colleges, FIRE [**interviewed local students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/) about it, Harris noted, learning that “they found the definition highly confusing and were uncertain about what was now prohibited.

“In light of these broad definitions, it is perhaps not surprising that Yale has been the subject of at least 6 lawsuits brought by students accused of sexual misconduct,” she said, “alleging they were denied a fair process in their on-campus judicial proceedings.”

**MORE**: [**New York affirmative consent law baffles students**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/legally-mandated-yes-means-yes-sex-standard-affirmatively-baffles-nyu-students-video/)

***Yale more dangerous for female grad students than for undergrads?***

Further analysis of the report shows that 146 of the misconduct claims went to the Title IX office, which handles informal resolution, while only seven went to the university-wide committee, which actually adjudicates complaints.

The average age of reporting students has risen, both at Yale and nationally, according to Johnson. He attributes this trend to older students having attended college in an “accuser-friendly Title IX environment.”

If valid, this trend would indicate that Yale “becomes more dangerous for female students as they age out of the 18-24-year-old cohort.”

In the Yale cohort of the Association of American Universities’ 2015 “[**climate survey**](https://provost.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/WestatReportYaleUniversity-1.pdf)” on sexual assault and misconduct, 16.1 percent of Yale students reported they had experienced an attempted or completed act of sexual misconduct. Spangler is one of the credited designers of this [**national survey**](https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/%40%20Files/Climate%20Survey/AAU_Campus_Climate_Survey_12_14_15.pdf), which will release 2019 results later this year.

Yale might not be alone in the Ivy League when it comes to a spike in reported sexual misconduct.

Last week Harvard University announced the debut of an anonymous Title IX reporting form, following apparent interest from the student body. It will allow students to submit Title IX complaints against anyone at Harvard with no trace back to themselves.

[***The Harvard Crimson***](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/8/title-ix-anonymous/#.XZycnWshBfU.twitter) notes that the rollout “follows the Government Department Committee on Climate Change’s recommendation that Harvard institute an anonymous reporting system in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against former Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez.”

Asked if he saw a connection between the new Harvard reporting system and the high number of complaints at Yale, Johnson told *The Fix* in an email that the two situations weren’t connected but rather “problematic for their own reasons.”

“Harvard raises issues \[because\] it allows anonymous complaints by witnesses \[with an\] explicit statement that the \[accused\] party won’t learn of the allegation,” he said. In an aside, Johnson said Harvard’s system “is already less fair than Yale’s, which is saying something.”

The core problem with Yale’s system is the “extremely broad definition of sexual assault” combined with Spangler’s practice of “leaving readers with the implication that all of these allegations have been adjudicated and upheld, even though only a tiny percentage of them are,” he said.

holocat1,"I am a sophomore in physics and astronomy at Stony Brook University and am debating whether to to transfer to Yale. Stony Brook is surprisingly very top notch in physics, especially the nuclear and particle areas, but is lackluster in astronomy. I am looking for a more focused program in astrophysics, as I would like to pursue a PhD in the subject, and Yale seems like an excellent fit for what I need.

Currently, I work for a virtual reality startup based in Silicon Valley, research in astrophysics with an established professor, and am on the club rowing team (We do not have an official division team for our school), amongst other clubs and such. I am also a member of the very selective Women's STEM program.

cum4mefess,"Hey everyone: 
This is going to be a slightly long post so please sit through this with me. 
I'm really having trouble making a decision as to where to go to college, and I'm torn between MIT/Yale. I applied as engineering, but to be completely honest, I really don't know what I'm going to major at college. I'm pretty sure it's going to be STEM(mostly math or physics related) or maybe economics/finance industry.

What I like about Yale:

Faculty student relations- since it has a super small STEM department, class sizes are super small, and students get to know their professors very well(which I really like). I talked to one professor and he said he will literally be on my ass to help me get internships

Student body- not everyone is STEM, and I will know people from different majors doing different things in the future. There are also a lot of well known political figures coming in for speeches

Less stress- definitely not going to be easy, but not as hardcore as MIT

What I dislike about Yale:

Opportunities- smaller school means fewer opportunities. Also, I'm not too sure about this, but does coming from a less well regarded engineering/STEM school reduce my chance of finding a good job? Because I've heard many people say don't go to Yale for engineering

What I like about MIT:

Academics- MIT is the better school academically for STEM majors. Easy job/internship opportunity

research opportunities- cutting edge research opportunities

summer program- I applied to a summer program at MIT that would give me a huge head start during the summer. If I get in, it's defintely going to be a game changer for me. But I'll only know if I commit :(

What I dislike about MIT:

Stress- The most important reason that's keeping me from committing to MIT is stress/workload. I know it's definitely not going to be easy at Yale or any other top schools (that's not what I'm looking for anyways), but I think MIT's course load is just especially stressful. I don't want to be in an environment where I'm constantly super stressed and pulling my hairs out.

social life- I'm not into the ""work hard, play hard"" model at MIT. Don't want to die on weekdays and have huge parties on weekends


Finally, I have some questions that I need honest answers for: 
1. Are most students happy at Yale? 
2. How stressful is a STEM major Yale (Especially compared to MIT if anyone has experience)? How much do students sleep on average?

There is a good chance that I will be choosing Yale for my PhD, and I'd like to know if anyone here has any experience with graduate housing.

I'm going to be out of the US until later in August, so I don't think I'll have a chance to preview apartments. Having said that, Yale's graduate housing seems very reasonably priced, and it would give me a good chance to ""mesh"" with the school for a year, as I've never even seen it before.

Has anyone here lived in on-campus graduate housing? Did you like it? Is it quiet? Safe?

I've heard some things about New Haven's safety, but it seems like the area around Yale is OK, yes? I don't know why so many good universities are surrounded by such dangerous neighborhoods.

dhm1909,"Hey all. 

i’m a first year still figuring out my course schedule and i have narrowed it down to a few options. 

Thus far, I have only really decided on the following three courses:

Calc 115 ( calc 2) 
Chem 174 ( First year orgo) 
Chem 222La ( lab for organic chem) 
The History of World History ( First year seminar)

I am having difficulty choosing my fourth course. i want something that is easy considering how hard the rest of my schedule is. 

My current contenders are the following: 

Fren130 ( L30 french with Ruth Koizim) 
Econ 110 ( seminar of intro to microeconomics) 
Econ 115 ( into to microeconomics) 
Bio 101 ( intro to bio) 

i don’t want to take french this semester because of how hard the professor makes the course sound; in addition to meeting everyday, Koizim proudly declared that she would be assigning 90-120 minutes of homework every night, which i feel would be too much considering my other classes. 

I have heard that it is better to take Bio during the off cycle. 

Anyway, i would love to hear your thoughts on what my fourth course should be. i want to have a schedule that would keep me busy but also allow me time to have a social life and delve into extracurricular activities. And because i am currently considering attending medical school, it is necessary that i do well in my classes.
