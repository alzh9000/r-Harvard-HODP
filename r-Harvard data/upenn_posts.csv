Things will only get better from here on out and soon we will be back to normal.

PM_ME_UR_CROSSWORD,"Congratulations! You did it! 
If you're eager to learn more about Penn, here are some words of advice for the Penn Class of '23 from a current Penn freshman. 

**Put yourself out there.**

New Student Orientation (NSO) is when everyone is looking to make friends. Try to balance between making quality vs. quantity friends. For me personally, I knew most of my high school class since elementary or middle school, so I really put a lot of effort (especially as an introvert) on being able to make new friends in college. This is the chance to forget all the dumb mistakes and embarassing moments from high school. You don't have to be the same person that you used to be, so put yourself out there. These could be the last four years where you'll be in the same space as a large number of your peers where people are open to making new connections and learning from each other. 

**Develop time management skills.**

There are so many things going on all the time on campus. You will likely need to devote some time to learn how to use Google Calendar and an agenda/planner or some organizational system if you don't already. If you got by without being very organized in high school, I can guarantee that it's much harder to do in college. 
I'd recommend scheduling the important activities in your life first: sleep, eating, being active, and having time for yourself. These are my priorities because if I don't take care of myself, my mental and physical health both go to shit and I can't get anything done. 

Stop procrastinating. Try to start your homework as soon as possible. One strategy I learned was to schedule time in between your classes to do homework so you don't waste too much time doing nothing. Another I learned was to set a cutoff period of time: work as hard as you can until, for example, 9 PM, and then just cut yourself off from work and chill with your friends. This helps you avoid burnout. Also, it's much harder to break a cycle of being behind in college. If you start strong, it's much more likely that you'll end strong. 

**Consider what you want from college.**

I decided that I wanted to grow in a number of different ways. For me, I was finally able to accomplish a lot of goals that I had for a long time, but never pursued previously. I think I learned somewhere that with big life changes, you're more likely to be able to form new habits than on a daily basis. I started lifting (7AM Pottruck, anyone?), eating healthier, became more organized, got more sleep, and procrastinated less. 
Personally, I want to learn more about myself and the world. 

**Figure out a *tentative* four year plan by the end of your first year.**

This is especially important if you want to study abroad or do multiple majors/concentrations/minor! Although it is a bit much to plan out all four years of your college within the first 25%, I believe that it's important to do a tentative plan so that you can research the requirements and understand what you really need to take. Consider what classes can count for multiple requirements. Some schools use RateMyProfessor, but we have PennCourseSearch and PennCourseReview (the latter requires PennKey access, I forget about the former). 
If you're in a special program (M&T/Huntsman/BFS), there will be specific requirements for your curriculum, and it's important that you get started as soon as possible to fulfill these requirements.

Your advisor will help you register for classes! We have this thing called ""Advance Registration"", where within a two week period, as long as you have your requests in by the end of the period, your requests will be submitted. After advance registration ends, an algorithm will determine what classes everyone will take based on everyone's requests and how everyone ranks their preferences. Schedules will be available for view a couple weeks or so after the end of Advance Registration. If you don't get into your classes, use PennCourseNotify; it will email you when someone drops the class! 

**You don't have to go into consulting or finance.**

Yes, a LOT of Penn students do, so it is feasible. But if you don't give a shit about consulting or finance, don't do it just because everyone else is. Find something you're actually interested in so that you don't have to suffer learning and doing things you don't actually care about. Penn is such a great institution and there's so much more to learn than consulting or finance. 

**Figure out what your limits are.**

If you're not sure if you want to drink or do drugs when you get to Penn, I'd recommend making the decision before you come to campus. If you say no, stick with it. You can still have fun, but the odds of you having fun at parties are significantly lower, and that's completely okay. 

If you say yes, please have tried these things in a safe environment and know what your limits are. Count your drinks. Be careful about who you accept your drinks from. Don't do anything too stupid. It's not fun waking up in the hospital having blacked out and gotten MERTed (Medical Emergency Response Team). 

**Get the Penn Mobile App when you get to campus.**

It tells you what washers and dryers are available, what dining halls are open, and lets you book group study rooms. I'm sure there are more functions, but these are the most important/useful ones. During NSO, dining halls' schedules are subject to change and may not be reflected on the app, so be wary of that. 

**College shopping list with miscellaneous advice:**

Invest in good waterproof shoes and an umbrella, and keep the umbrella in your backpack. (Check the weather daily.)

Acetominophen/Ibuprofen, thermometer, cough drops: you will likely get sick. If you don't have meds and your friends don't either/are busy, it will be treacherous to walk all the way to CVS when your limbs feel like they're going to fall off your body. 

Get a warm winter jacket: it doesn't have to be Canada Goose or Moncler. 

Learn to layer: invest in thermals. I recommend Uniqlo Heattech-- super lightweight and very warm. 

**Don't necessarily listen to everyone who says to get the dining plan with the most dining dollars.**

This is an unpopular opinion, but if you want to eat three meals a day, I recommend getting the dining plan with the most swipes. Yes, you'll have to sit down and it's not convenient if you have many back-to-back classes around lunch time (Hill just introduced continuous service though, so this isn't really an argument anymore anyway), but nothing's better than being able to eat until you're full and not worry about how many dining dollars you have left. If you really don't have time to sit down in the dining halls and eat, you can also get a to-go container. 
Hill and New College House (NCH) and Hillel are the best dining halls, hands down. They have healthy options that still taste good. Mclelland is convenient for breakfast and late-night, but their food is slightly questionable. Only very slightly. Anyone who talks mad shit about Mclelland breakfast has probably never actually eaten breakfast at Mclelland. 

**Don't be afraid to ask for help.**

Penn is going to challenge you in many ways, and that's perfectly okay. Don't forget that Penn is an institution with all the resources it has. CAPS, your advisor(s), your RA/GA, and your friends! CAPS has a bad reputation. But if you need someone to talk to or are just going through some things, I'd HIGHLY recommend going to CAPS. Also, be real with your friends; they want to help! Don't be afraid to talk to friends from home; they're probably going through similar things. And if they're not, then that doesn't mean that they aren't willing to listen. 

**Consider your mindset.**

No matter what happens, it's ok. Having resilience is much more important than being successful at first. Eventually everyone is going to have setbacks, and if you're resilient, then you can get through anything. Accept that shit happens. It's okay. 

Grades aren't everything. Don't take them too seriously. They aren't everything.   

Your mindset is a large determining factor in your success. Know that things will be okay and that you can keep moving forward. 

**Enjoy the rest of your senior year and your summer!**

It only comes once!

Best of luck! :) Feel free to PM me if you have any questions or just want to talk about Penn.

anonymoussquirrel08,"this is just a quick rant. 

I'm not in support of everything Penn is doing but some of y'all really act like Penn's main motive is to get you in life. Behind Penn is a real person working behind the scenes. They are REAL people who are dealing with this situation too. There is a reason why Penn had to kick out everyone under such a short period of time. You guys have to remember that every college did this to their students and they wouldn't make such a drastic decision if the cons didn't outweigh the pros. Like sure Penn hasn't always done everything right but you guys need to also try and understand the position they are in as well. 

Another thing is that PENN IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LAID OFF BON APPETIT WORKERS. I bet 90% of you didn't even read the article and just read the heading, which I believe was highly MISLEADING. Penn is NOT the one laying off the workers and it Is also NOT Bon Appetit laying off the workers. It was their PARENT COMPANY'S doing and Bon Appetit clearly stated they did not have control over that, so stop going around with the petitions and bashing on Penn for this one bc this one was really out of their control.",you guys gotta stop with this,180,0.93,fksob7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/fksob7/you_guys_gotta_stop_with_this/,16,1584578868.0,2020-03-18 19:47:48

cornflowerblue7,"* They want us to come back to campus, but it depends on the situation (on testing availability, contact tracing, treatment availability, etc. )
* Four possible situations they're considering for the fall, some of which could be combined:
   * Smaller classes (<25 people) will meet in person with distancing/protective measures implemented. Larger classes will meet online even if you're staying on campus.
   * The semester will be in person until Thanksgiving and will be online for the rest of the semester. Some classes might add more meeting times because of this.
   * An increase in Summer 2021 course offerings
   * An entirely online fall semester
* Undergrad/grad/professional situations are likely to be different
* Effects on campus life, if we end up on campus:
   * We would be expected to wear masks, practice social distancing, avoid large gatherings
   * We should be prepared to be regularly tested, self-report symptoms and work remotely
   * The availability of regular testing is very important
   * Travel to/from Philly would be discouraged, if you have to travel you'd have to self-isolate when you get back
   * Less students in dorms
   * Limiting hours/the number of people allowed in at once for high-traffic locations (libraries, Pottruck)

Fredh21,"This post will not talk about Penn's policy of kicking students out.

Same, I don't wanna argue about who should be responsible for that. China, Trump, CDC, WHO... we can believe in whatever narrative we like.

As a Penn student who stayed in China during the outbreak since January, I would like to share some of my thoughts.

**R0**

>‘R0 predicts the number of people who can catch a given bug from a single infected person. Currently, the R0 for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, is estimated at about 2.2 (even up to 4), meaning a single infected person will infect about 2.2 others, on average. By comparison, the flu has an R0 of 1.3. '

The number of infected will easily double in 2-3 days without proper quarantine measures. If there are 500 unknown virus carriers in NYC, there will be 5k by next week. (The number is just for illustration)

&#x200B;

**Incubation**

>In the resulting models, estimated median incubation time (IT) of COVID-19 was 5.1 days; mean IT was 5.5 days. For 97.5% of infected persons, symptoms appear by 11.5 days.

Compared with SARS in 2003, this virus is less fatal but the long incubation has made it a more dangerous one. Virus carriers can still infect others even without any symptoms. The longest incubation period observed is about one month.

So don't laugh at or insult people wearing masks, especially those from East-Asia, where wearing a mask is an acceptable culture. At least they lower your risk of being infected.

&#x200B;

**Mortality Rate**

According to WHO by March 3rd: “**Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died**. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.”  (Flu is around 0.1%)

However, the mortality rate of Covid-19 is complex, largely depending on the medical support level and the population's age group distribution.

&#x200B;

[Statistics by 3.13](https://preview.redd.it/fu639oe75km41.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=97272d79e032eb7872cc791b328d3692833f630a)

Italy's healthcare system once was regarded, by WHO's ranking, as the 2nd best in the world after France. But now Italy has reached a crazy mortality rate of 7.1%.  It is the result when the number of infected cases exceeds the healthcare system capacity.

Given sufficient and proper medical support, the mortality rate can be as low as 1%, such as South Korea or other China's provinces except Hubei (the initial outbreak province). On the other hand, once the cases exceed the current medical supply, the mortality rate can surge to 5% and above, such as Italy and Hubei province in China.

*Note: Elderly people and people with an underlying health problem are much more likely to die. This is also a partial reason why the mortality rate in Italy is crazy.*

&#x200B;

[It's a good graph, but missing something](https://preview.redd.it/rguea6ip5km41.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecac9b3c13e593f220e7f120b25efe5f68f93bab)

The above is a good graph by CDC, but I think it is missing one critical information, the difference in mortality rate for two curves.

[The mortality rate will surge without proper control measures](https://preview.redd.it/2b0lbnw06km41.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=48c40e96f1cf9e79d4c0d590c4be7769740ae5d7)

**Self-isolation without medical support?**

There are some governments, maybe Trump's administration as well, are still regarding COVID-19 as a 'big' flu. They expect most patients to stay at home (even refusing to test them), until recovery or turning to severe. Take the UK for example, Boris asked UK citizens to self-quarantine 7 days before turning to professional help, even for those with symptoms.

This idea is simply wrong.

Most media is also missing one critical question: what's the percentage turning to severe from mild, without proper medical support?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kep9xyaj6km41.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d6b829a8709d0b6f092c41c497eced3f8934fe9

Without proper medical support, oxygen, anti-virus doses, saline and etc, 20% of cases will turn into severe and then critical, of which 50% could eventually die. This means an up to 10% mortality rate. ***Severe cases will still destroy the existing healthcare system.*** Aggressive measures have to be taken, in order to protect mild patients from turning into severe.

**Asking all mild patients to stay at home is not a working policy**, which perhaps will cost much more lives. Wuhan, China once tried this policy but the city got tens of thousands more cases, especially group infections within the family.

Some may argue that home-quarantine can avoid cross-infection in hospitals, which is a valid reason. However, self-quarantine at home is dangerous for patients and family members, and it increases the risk of community transmission. I understand many countries have no capacity to quarantine all patients but clearly the USA should have the capacity to do so.

\[Update:

US  has more single-family houses so self quarantining is less risky compared with other countries. US's misstep was the slow testing.  We may expect massive testing and Drive-through testing in the States by next week. Massive testing + (home) quarantine might be the best control measure for US.\]

Note: If you got infected and could not get a hospital bed immediately, please find an isolated room and avoid any contact with your family members.

>*Also, before you go to the hospital, make sure to call your healthcare provider so they can prepare.*

**Beyond the Mortality Rate**

Maybe most young people are lucky enough to recover from COVID-19. But it is not the end of the Covid-19 story. According to clinical researches so far, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, will not only attack your lung but also your liver, kidney, even your Central Nervous System. Some recovered patients may suffer from permanent lung/liver/kidney damage, depending on their health condition. The exact damage is not yet clear.

To make things worse, the virus might damage the kidney and *testicular* tissue of male patients, causing partial or complete impaired fertility. China‘s hospitals and local authorities have already encouraged male patients to get fertility testing.

So, even though most Penn students are very young, don't be so optimistic about this disease.

&#x200B;

**How to Protect Yourself?**

You can find many helpful advice via google. So I don't bother to repeat them. You can check this link from WHO if you haven't learned much.

[https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)

The best way to protect yourself is to keep social distancing, avoid public space activities. Stop party celebrating the school close.

Note: It is quite controversial on whether healthy people should wear masks. There is no concrete evidence showing a healthy people can protect themselves by wearing a surgical mask (not N95, N95 does help). However, it is for sure that wearing a mask will protect others. Research revealed that the surgical mask can block 60%-95% droplets spread by a flu patient.

Once again, this virus has a long incubation period so it's good to have asymptomatic people wearing masks. Please don't discriminate against people who wear masks.

&#x200B;

Though I have tried to refer as many professional sources as I could, this post is still my personal opinion, rather than a professional work. Feel free to raise your concern or question my argument.

Thx for your reading and I may update more to this post.

CheeseSteak24,Fall break was initially cancelled because the university expected a campus with students on it and it expected that those students would go travelling to all sorts of places during and come back ready to infect one another with corona. I say we someone make a petition to reinstate fall break now since the campus will basically be empty. It will be a good opportunity to rest and regain some mental energy rather than virtually going to classes 5 days a week until Thanksgiving.,Bring Back Fall Break,113,0.97,i9e08z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/i9e08z/bring_back_fall_break/,22,1597402315.0,2020-08-14 05:51:55

CrackerMoncher,"It seems like most people are excited for Penn to go remote. I understand going remote has its valid reasons...

Idk if it’s okay for me to feel the complete opposite, but this would really suck if we also went remote. I just can’t suffer another semester of taking classes at home, my home life is miserable and my spring grades had tanked. I tried taking classes both summer sessions to redeem myself, it worked... not really.
Another semester of feeling like a worthless piece of shit while I’m forced to live under the same household as my parents.

I miss independence, privacy, my girlfriend, and just being able to study without having to expect anyone to blast through my door and berate me for not having a job yet as a rising sophomore. Fuck Penn face, and fuck my insecurities, I’m not perfect like my suitemates or that kid walking down the street. I say this even knowing that everyone has their own struggles and are also dealing with some form of Penn Face, even if they don’t show it. That’s what Penn Face does, I guess. Everything is not fucking alright.

If fall goes remote, all my plans and hopes for starting fresh, away from my parents and their words, are gonna go to shit.

Hah this rant has no direction and has lost its purpose already.

If you could relate, hang in there, it’s fucking tough but you’re tougher. If you couldn’t, well good for you and hopefully you have a nice home and a close group of friends who care about you.","not sure if i can post this, but",107,0.95,i5ol2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/i5ol2p/not_sure_if_i_can_post_this_but/,29,1596871663.0,2020-08-08 02:27:43

AanyaBuk,"Realize that everything is about efficiency. Put in a minimal amount of effort to get maximum results. Produce until marginal utility equals marginal cost. That means for grades, make sure that you put in just the right amount of work to get a pass or an A. 

Read all your syllabi. Outline all your classwork in a neat calendar to ensure that you don’t submit anything late. Then do a weighted ranking of all your assignments by their due date and importance and start plugging away through them at the beginning of the semester. Aim to finish thirty percent of all your assignments within the first two weeks of school. 

If you are excellent at something, you will be admired. If you are mediocre, no one will give you attention. So, make sure you join a club and become the absolute best at leading it. Completely restructure the way that the club is organized if you must. Make it into your own pet project and make it successful. 

Another important thing to pay attention to is reputation. Scientifically, it has been shown that people who are more important in a room give less eye-contact to people who are their inferiors. This means that if you want to project your dominance onto other people, you should give people less eye contact. This means that when you’re walking on locust walk, you should not wave to people you recognize. waving only wastes time and gives you popularity. You’re not at school to become popular, because popularity wastes time. This means that you should act seriously, act professionally, act smart, and above all, act like an adult. You’re no longer a teenager anymore. 

Make sure to take time to rest and take care of yourself. But do this in the most effective way possible. Exercising, meditating, smoking weed, and going for a drink are some of the more effective ways of relaxing. All of them can be accomplished with little time wasted. Drinking should be reserved for days where you do not have a large exam in the week after or for days in which you do not have anything to do during the day after drinking. Casual flings are a plus. If you can effectively have them without the emotional baggage, go for it.

The earlier you graduate, the more successful you are, so do not be afraid to load up on classes and graduate in three years. Sub matriculate into the engineering school’s master’s program if you can. Transfer into Wharton or M&T as early as you can, because Wharton sounds good on a resume.

Don’t waste your time voting, because it takes a lot of time to learn about politics enough for you to understand the policy issues. Rather, find a friend who is politically involved and who you respect. Copy their votes. Voting is not like an exam. You’re allowed to get the right answers from someone else. Better yet, do not vote, because voting is a waste of your time. Politics is only impactful on the aggregate, and since the people around you almost always vote Democrat, it does not really matter anyway, regardless of whether you’re Democrat or Republican. You will only have influence if you spend significant amounts of time trying to persuade people and have conversations. That again is a waste of time. 

Long run, you will be more impactful the more money you make, so it’s more important for you to spend time trying to figure out how to make money. Then, you can invest in lobbying efforts to change the government. 

Do anything you can do to get an A in a class. That means asking your friends for prior exams, asking your friends for prior homework, drinking red bull, and taking Adderall to finish essays. While empirically, Adderall does not help high-performing students do better on exams, it may help you focus to finish assignments. You may also develop a dependency but weigh the risks. Do not help people within your class unless you’re confident that you can one-up them. They are your competitors, not your compatriots.

Most students at Penn end up going into investment banking or consulting after college, even after controlling for the time that each person agonizes about what kind of career they want to have. That means, to be the most efficient, you should not spend time trying to find out what your ideal job would be. It’s a waste of time. Rather, aim high. Aim for the best consulting job there is and start preparing in freshman or sophomore year summer. Get some pdfs of books and start practicing cases with your upperclassmen friends.

Upperclassmen friends are more useful than underclassmen friends. Upperclassmen can help you get things. Underclassmen only drag you down. There are plenty of people out there that can help you talk about your feelings. You don’t have to spend too much time talking to your friends. It is far more efficient to talk to someone at CAPS than to spend time taking care of yourself because the people at CAPS (or a private therapist) are trained professionals and are paid to listen to you vent. Friends come with all kinds of baggage and are inefficient investments.

Treat your time as the cash in a discounted cash flow investment. Each unit of time you invest in something, you expect to get future units of time as a return. Know that the benchmark investment is in good grades and a good career, so anything that has a net present value that is lower than that investment should not be pursued. Some friendships have a positive net present value. Other friendships have negative net present value (they will not save you any time in the long run). These friendships are worthless and should be trashed. 

In general, it is difficult to find out which friendships have a positive or negative net present value. Therefore, look to social network analysis. The wider a social network you have, the greater the likelihood of your future success. However, the bonds between you and each person you know do not have to be that deep. They just must be slightly deep. That means that you should not invest too much in getting to know people. Just invest enough so that if you were to email this person in a couple of years, they would remember who you are and do you a favor. 

Make sure that you never consider sunk costs. That means that if you’ve invested a lot into building a relationship with a friend, but then it turns sour, and there is better opportunity elsewhere, ditch that friend and find another friend group. Some friends are toxic. Friendships are not worth it. 

Remember, as you end this semester at Penn and start a new one, being efficient is the most important thing you can do to have a meaningful, successful life. Put on that Penn Face and become your true self.

I was recently admitted to Wharton which I'm really stoked about. However, I'm concerned about the quality of freshman housing *—* specifically surface area.

As far as I can tell, the largest bedroom in Lauder College House is 112 sqft. This just isn't going to cut it for me because I'm used to a 500 sqft bedroom with a queen bed. I really can't imagine how people live without a living room in their dorm. I also NEED a full kitchen because my passion is cooking. My daddy is willing to pay for an on-campus dorm and an on-campus apartment. Don't worry I'm not spoiled or anything it's just that I have the money so I want to use it.

My budget is \~$5000/m for the apartment. Has anyone done a similar thing and can give me recommendations on which buildings I should check out? I don't think that distance should be a big issue because I have a Boosted Rev scooter.

happistrawberry123,"Based on talking to my friends and seeing people post about how excited they are about coming back to campus, I'm confused as to why people aren't more concerned about their health/safety in the fall. I've been planning to come back to campus, but as I see other universities move operations completely online due to rising cases, I'm becoming increasingly concerned about the fall. I'm at a point where I feel like Penn can't invite all of its students back in good conscience. Obviously, I think people who truly don't have a home environment that is appropriate for education should be able to go back. Maybe freshmen should also be allowed. But having everyone come back seems completely unsafe. I feel like I'm having to choose between my education and health. I also have very little faith that Penn will make sure large gatherings don't happen.

Kinsoo,"The Trump administration has agreed to rescind [rules it issued last week](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-detail-how-foreign-students-canand-canttake-classes-at-u-s-colleges-this-fall-11594056119) governing whether international students can enroll at U.S. universities this fall, settling a lawsuit filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston federal court.

The schools had asked for a temporary restraining order pausing enforcement of the policy.

At a short hearing Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs confirmed that a settlement had been reached. She said the government would rescind the policy, withdraw an FAQ detailing the rule and return to the status quo of guidance issued in the spring.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had issued regulations earlier this month limiting foreign students’ ability to take classes online and stay in the U.S. Many colleges and universities have adjusted their teaching plans for fall in light of the coronavirus pandemic, including opting for online-only courses, and the regulations have upended international students’ plans.

Harvard and MIT said in a court filing Tuesday, before the hearing, that they and their students would face “irreparable injury” if an injunction wasn’t granted. They had also filed declarations from students who said they wouldn’t be able to participate in online instruction from their home countries, because of government restrictions or poor internet service.

IF (and that's a big IF) the question of you choosing to take classes Pass / Fail during the pandemic comes up in a job interview process, and the potential employer views your completion of a class with a P/F as a negative, **you have just been given a gift of knowing that you can avoid proceeding through the interview process with an absolutely morally bankrupt, awful company.** 

When deciding whether or not to swap over to P/F, make that decision based on your capabilities and mental health right now. Do not make it based on what you think a hiring officer might think in the future.

When you are in interviews in the future, and it comes time for you to have the chance to ask your interviewer questions about the company, one of them should be:

>""What did Company X do to protect your employees and customers during the pandemic? How did Company X ensure the continued safety and financial / health insurance security of your employees?""

Any company that tries to ding you for taking a class pass / fail or doesn't have a ready and satisfactory answer to the above should be avoided like the plague, so to speak.

BagOrdinary,"Sophomore here and let's just say, it's been rough. Freshman year ended up miserable, doing poorly in my classes, spending long nights in the library, not having any friends after around October, skipping club meetings to cry in my room, and honestly having that sigh of relief after my last final knowing I wouldn't have to listen to my hallmates nag about how antisocial I became. I even ditched work once purely and walked into the city for no reason because I couldn't stop beating myself down about failing yet another midterm. My roommate would call me hardworking, not knowing that all my late nights and dinners spent in VanPelt were because I didn't feel comfortable being in our room because of their comments and that more often that not my studying never truly paid off. I made it out of that semester and was doing pretty well in the spring, joining clubs, doing well in my classes, making time for myself, and overall being the happiest I could be byy myself. When everything went online, life definitely changed, but I was content with it. Sure I lost some time on campus (which I now miss more than anything) but at least I could have someone to talk to and didn't have to worry too much about all the little things. I'd say that semester went well for me, I still got a B in one of my classes, but overall, I felt much more positive about things and was looking forward to the fall.

Long story short, I stayed home, thinking that whatever I had in the last chunk of spring would be the same. It's not. I've had a weeks worth of lectures and material to cover in a few short days. Mandatory classes seem pointless to me, I feel like I'm not learning anything and that there's much more work that's not done during class/instructional time (I mean cmon you expect me to watch your three fourty minute lecture outside of class then come to class for three hours a week to do worksheets and such). I simply feel as if I'm just dragging myself through classes and doing the work because I have to. Time management hasn't been a struggle and I still have work and other commitments, but I haven't felt so burnt out and sad so quickly. Even making friends has been hard, I went to a few GBMs this week and felt so left out of the loop. Everyone seems to have their groups and have their friends and I'm just sitting there smiling, waiting to see if things will be better, only for me to slip out when they inevitably don't.

I'm not saying Penn is a bad school. I love Penn. I love the campus, the libraries, the academics, the opportunities. I love exploring Philly, love everything about it. But, in my year or so of being here, I've never felt such overwhelming sadness and now it's too late for me to transfer or do anything about it. And trust me, I'm not some antisocial hermit. I'm used to being surrounded by people, going to parties, having fun, grabbing dinners with pals (or at least that's how it was during high school until around NSO)

Congratulations to admitted students, the Class of 2024 Quakers! 

For those that did not get good news today--I am truly sorry. It's a shitty situation and happens to way too many qualified applicants every cycle. I know people will tell you this all the time, but take it from someone who was rejected from their dream school during the EA cycle 11 years ago (and cried for months afterward)--it will work out and as long as you make the best of where you'll end up, there's nothing stopping you in reaching your goals. I look back on that day 11 years ago and smile, as if I did get accepted all that time, I wouldn't have met my friends, my wife, and wouldn't enjoy the life I have now.

FightingQuaker17,"**This thread will also serve as the Penn Alumni Interview Thread for RD Applicants for Class of 2024**

#BEFORE ASKING A QUESTION, READ THIS ENTIRE POST, READ THE FAQ IN THE COMMENTS, AND LOOK OVER PREVIOUS THREADS

It's very likely your question has been asked/answered before.....

Most RD (BUT NOT ALL AND IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T GET ONE) applicants will have an interview anytime between now and the end of February. 

Feel free to ask specific questions to people here (and check out previous threads below), there are multiple alumni interviewers that are active on this sub (including me). The best advice I can give is to be prepared, speak your truth, be an advocate for yourself (the interview is NOT the time to be humble), and try to have a relaxing, comfortable conversation about your strengths and experiences. Also, definitely research things about Penn that you can specifically reference to when explaining why you want to come to Penn. Also don't google your interviewer. It's super weird when you do this.

That's pretty much all there is to it. BUT if you are freaking out a bit, here's some other information that may be helpful:

QUESTIONS YOU MAY GET/MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ANSWERS TO

Recommended questions for interviewers:

Note: You shouldn't memorize any answers to these questions. They should come naturally. It's helpful to prepare to make sure you hit on a few key points you want to get across, but if you sound like a robot, it won't look good. These are just RECOMMENDED questions, so you aren't guaranteed to get any of them (In fact, many interviewers don't know this lists exists and won't use any of these questions). During my interviews, I usually start off with a few questions that I want to make sure I get, but the conversation that follows usually comes natural (i.e., I ask follow up questions that relate to what the applicant says).

*General introduction*

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

How would your friends describe you?

What experiences have you had with people who are different from you?

What would you like the Admissions office to know that might not appear in your application?

*Academic and Personal interests*

What do you most like learning about?

How do you learn best?

What is your favorite part of your school experience?

What topics or assignments have you found particularly intriguing?

Is there anything that you would change about your high school experience?

How do you spend your time when you're not in school?

What's the biggest challenge you've overcome?

*What would this student be like at Penn?*

Why Penn? How did you first hear about Penn?

What draws you to the undergraduate school/program to which you’ve applied?

What on-campus opportunities are you most excited about?

*Share your Penn experience*

What questions do you have?

Is there anything you’d like to tell me that I haven’t asked you about?

>*A few hours away, at the University of Pennsylvania, researchers are also testing the safety of another genetic vaccine, produced by the nearby biotech company Inovio. Codenamed INO-4800, the vaccine is made out of synthetic DNA instead of RNA, though the principle is the same. Packaged into the DNA is a section of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Highlights:

# Will I have the option to take my courses pass/fail?

# Yes. We are extending this policy to the fall semester. All undergraduate students in all undergraduate Schools will be able to opt in, by October 30, to take any or all of their courses pass/fail, including courses taken to satisfy major or general education requirements, and these courses will not count against the total number of pass/fail courses allowed by the School.

**Can I still take a leave of absence for this semester?**

Undergraduate students (other than incoming students) can request leaves of absence through their School advising office. We encourage undergraduate students considering a leave of absence to consult their academic advisor.

**I am an incoming student. Can I still take a leave of absence for this semester?**

Incoming undergraduate students in the Class of 2024 can request a one-year deferral or gap year on their Penn Applicant Portal no later than 5 PM on August 18, 2020.

**I have already paid for the fall semester. How and when will I receive a refund?**

We will begin making adjustments to student accounts within the next two weeks. If you have already paid tuition and fees, the adjustment will likely create a credit on your account. The first refunds will be generated the week of August 24 and will occur weekly after that. If you have provided your bank account information through [Penn.Pay](https://Penn.Pay), your refund will be directly deposited into your account. This is the fastest method of refund delivery.

**How can I retrieve my personal possessions in storage from last spring?**

Your possessions will be stored for you at no cost until spring semester – or you can pay to have them shipped to your home.

**What happens to my housing assignment for the fall semester?**

You are guaranteed on-campus housing for the spring semester if you were assigned a room and did not cancel your assignment before August 11. Your room location may change, given the potential changes to public health requirements.

**I am a highly aided student/student with personal circumstances who may qualify to live on campus. Who do I contact?**

Please visit [**My Home at Penn**](https://myhomeatpenn.upenn.edu/) and complete the Housing Exception Form.

**When will I move in if I am granted a housing exception?**

Students who are granted housing exceptions will move in at their originally selected 2-hour timeslot for move-in. If a student did not select a timeslot or needs to move their timeslot (based on limited availability), they can do so at Campus Express. All students will be required to go to Houston Hall for a COVID-19 test before moving in and will receive detailed information in advance about the procedures they will need to follow for move-in.

**Can I access CAPS and the Student Health Service?**

Both CAPS and SHS are fully operational, incorporating both telehealth and in-person services. CAPS is available 24/7 at 215.898.7021. SHS is available 24/7 at 215.746.3535.

Silent_Packmule,"
Hey guys. So as midterms come around I think it’s important to realize that school isn’t everything. In fact it’s basically nothing and something you should relegate to the periphery of your focus at any given moment.

Sure midterms are hard, but if you want to be successful not just at Penn but in life, you need to understand that there are really only 3 important things in life. I’ll explain

The three things you MUST do are:

1. go on vacations with cool people. Being cool can be tough. It’s not enough to be good looking, extroverted, confident, talented, and wear Common Projects. You also have to go on vacation to cool places. The more obscure the better. Paris? Cliche. A cabin in the Smokey mountains? Now that’s cool. Philadelphia is NOT a cool city, that’s why it’s important to go on vacation as often as possible so people know that you don’t actually like it here. 

2. Purchase expensive brand name clothing and consumer electronics. Ok so everyone hates their job right? And if you don’t hate your job you’d probably rather be doing something else. Well how do you solve this problem? Purchase expensive brand name clothing and consumer electronics to show everyone how good you are at the job you hate. Pro tip, find a way to have rich parents so you can buy the expensive brand name clothing and consumer electronics without having to work the icky job.

3. Intern at Bain. This one seems obvious but a surprisingly few amount of people actually do this. For those of you that don’t know, Bain is a company that only hires people from Penn. During the interview you have to be able to add and subtract and multiply and divide numbers really well so if you work there people will know that you can do all those things. Lots of people know you should work at Bain, but very few people actually do this which is confusing. If you figure out why, let me know in the comments! 

I hope this helped. It makes me really sad to see people walking around campus without realizing that there’s so much more to life than reading and writing and working hard and developing goals and achieving success and finding yourself. Those things are fine sure, but they definitely won’t make you happy in the long term.

Stress is really bad for you so if you’re stressed out you should really try and stop doing that. Keep focus on what’s important and don’t tell anyone if you’re anxious or upset about anything because that’s really annoying and weird.

moniker02,"Does anyone else at this school feel like the dialogue at Penn is always about FGLI or the super-wealthy, whether that's the students or the administration?

I mean I understand that it is an ivy league school and all, so it attracts a lot of wealth from around the world but is there really not that many of us that grew up in the ""middle class"" of America or rural areas. What about my classmates who are on financial aid but aren't considered ""highly aided"" am I really in a minority of two extremes? I am just curious if this is just my observation. Likewise, most people I have met are from suburbs or cities what about all the kids growing up in underfunded and underdeveloped rural areas.

As a student in such category, having no previous ties to Penn and on considerable financial aid to make this degree feasible I found it really interesting in the fall when the DP published a dozen opinions going back and forth between FGLI students and legacies the opinion of the students that don't really fall into either category was never addressed.

**KIND OF SERIOUS:**

Whether you love it or hate it, greek life is a significant part of the social scene at Penn. Not any more. [New policies](https://fall-2020-planning.upenn.edu/content/student-campus-compact) will make it significantly harder to recruit a new year's pledge class. Fraternities will need to develop new methods to recruit rushes due to the absence of parties. No longer will freshmen receive mysterious envelopes under their door. Dorm buildings will likely restrict access from non-residents, and freshmen will be further spread out. If sorority and fraternity rush happens this year, it would have to be on a much smaller scale in the spring. If it does not occur at all, greek organizations could be in financial trouble.

Usually, University-owned houses must be at capacity, or Penn will fine them. This year is a different situation, of course. Due to housing restrictions, some greek houses will not be able to make capacity. I expect Penn will not fine them, but the organization will make less money from members. This change in capacity may create more demand for off-campus housing.

But what if there is no rush this year? At least, greek organizations will suffer financially. At most, off-campus houses will not have enough residents to pay for next year.

What does this mean from the social side? A new generation of freshmen *and rising sophomores* will have little preconceived notions. NSO is a unique time when students have no work and can learn about fraternities through partying if they so choose. Many times, NSO is where students first learn about each fraternity. Freshmen will not have this opportunity. They will have little knowledge of historical inter-greek politics.

Next year will be an excellent time to recruit students based on what *really* matters: sisterhood and brotherhood.

Rush Spades.

You must “opt in” to this expanded pass/fail option, and any courses taken on a pass/fail basis during Spring 2020 do not count against the total number of courses you may take pass/fail according to the policy of your School.",We got optional pass/fail guys!,56,0.96,flw1gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/flw1gu/we_got_optional_passfail_guys/,30,1584743820.0,2020-03-20 17:37:00

Realistic-Storm,"Here me out, I wasn't planning to party etc, but I did want to make friends. Didn't make any first or second semester and was hoping sophomore year would finally be my chance. I was excited to meet people etc despite there being limited interaction in the dorms etc. Now, I feel stuck and lonely asf. 

I definitely will try and join other clubs and such and form study groups, but it's definitely making me anxious that I might almost be halfway done with college and still have no friends besides the ones in my hometown (a few that will be returning to campus). I know that sometimes people never find their true friends during their first year, but I'm a social person meaning that I do my best academically etc when I have friends to sort of help me blow off steam or study with.

FightingQuaker17,"So you got/are waiting for a Penn Alumni Interview and you have some questions. This thread is for you!

Feel free to ask specific questions to people here, there are multiple alumni interviewers that are active on this sub (including me). The best advice I can give is to be prepared, speak your truth, be an advocate for yourself (the interview is NOT the time to be humble), and try to have a relaxing, comfortable conversation about your strengths and experiences. Also, definitely research things about Penn that you can specifically reference to when explaining why you want to come to Penn. Also don't google your interviewer. 

That's pretty much all there is to it. BUT if you are freaking out a bit, here's some other information that may be helpful:

**QUESTIONS YOU MAY GET/MIGHT WANT TO HAVE ANSWERS TO**

Recommended questions for interviewers:

Note: You shouldn't memorize any answers to these questions. They should come naturally. It's helpful to prepare to make sure you hit on a few key points you want to get across, but if you sound like a robot, it won't look good. These are just RECOMMENDED questions, so you aren't guaranteed to get any of them (In fact, many interviewers don't know this lists exists and won't use any of these questions). During my interviews, I usually start off with a few questions that I want to make sure I get, but the conversation that follows usually comes natural (i.e., I ask follow up questions that relate to what the applicant says).

*General introduction*

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?

How would your friends describe you?

What experiences have you had with people who are different from you?

What would you like the Admissions office to know that might not appear in your application? 


*Academic and Personal interests*

What do you most like learning about?

How do you learn best?

What is your favorite part of your school experience?

What topics or assignments have you found particularly intriguing?

Is there anything that you would change about your high school experience?

How do you spend your time when you're not in school?

What's the biggest challenge you've overcome?

*What would this student be like at Penn?*

Why Penn? How did you first hear about Penn?

What draws you to the undergraduate school/program to which you’ve applied?

What on-campus opportunities are you most excited about?

*Share your Penn experience*

What questions do you have?

Is there anything you’d like to tell me that I haven’t asked you about?

*ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS HERE*: https://www.alumni.upenn.edu/s/1587/gid2/16/interior.aspx?sid=1587&gid=2&sitebuilder=1&pgid=13330

**Specific questions (i.e., the only 4 questions) that interviewers answer in their final report**

What are the student’s academic pursuits and interests? Why?

What are the student’s activities or passions outside of class? Why?

Why has the student decided to apply to Penn?

Is there anything of note, contextual details in particular, that the Admissions office should know about this student?

What is your bottom-line impression of the student and their potential fit for Penn?

(There's also a specific rating scale, something like ""Not a good fit"" all the way up to ""The Best I've Ever Interviewed"")

Anyway, I just posted a new video on my channel ([https://youtu.be/T5BZ5feGVyo](https://youtu.be/T5BZ5feGVyo)) and thought I could elaborate a bit on the point made in the video.

The main point is **there are numerous resources in colleges available to students which, in the midst of all the academic pressure and chaos, are often not publicized/made known.** As an example, Penn has a First Folio edition of Shakespeare (printed in 1623 and is the only reliable text for all of Shakespeare's 20 plays), or a digital library that allows you to rent equipments worth tens of thousands of dollars. All of my friends on campus that I've talked to did not even know of their existences, let alone actually using those resources.

I was recently at a talk where the guy told the audience to get that NSO flyer with all the resources and do a few each month. You really do not know what you'll end up finding out about Penn.

I've basically gone all year without any of my clothes and important belongings (heck my passport is in some storage facility, along with a lot of mementos) To ship my things home, would probably cost me around 500 or even more depending on shipping costs, not to mention that they packed my items in so many boxes. 

This alone was one of the reasons I intended to return to campus (as well as to secure spring housing), but now everything feels like we as students are stuck with the burden of retrieving our things  and possibly working out financial aid costs with Penn (since many full scholarship kids could actually owe Penn more money than usual)

I know at Penn I'll be taking on more responsibility: cooking meals, cleaning, studying, helping out siblings with homework and such from a distance, and trying to make friends through study groups etc, but I feel like it's worth it? Even if it's only three months, I think that the possibility of freedom to just be my own person in my own space and not being stressed out all the time due to parental problems will be beneficial.

Kinsoo,"[LINK](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during#wcm-survey-target-id)

WASHINGTON – The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) announced modifications Monday to temporary exemptions for nonimmigrant students taking online classes due to the pandemic for the fall 2020 semester. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security plans to publish the procedures and responsibilities in the Federal Register as a Temporary Final Rule.

Temporary exemptions for the fall 2020 semester include:

1. Nonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may ***not*** take a full online course load and remain in the United States. The U.S. Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit these students to enter the United States. Active students currently in the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status. If not, they may face immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings.
2. Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools operating under normal in-person classes are bound by existing federal regulations. Eligible F students may take a maximum of one class or three credit hours online.
3. Nonimmigrant F-1 students attending schools adopting a hybrid model—that is, a mixture of online and in person classes—will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status,” certifying that the program is not entirely online, that the student is not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training programs or M-1 students pursing vocational degrees, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses.

Schools should update their information in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) within 10 days of the change if they begin the fall semester with in-person classes but are later required to switch to only online classes, or a nonimmigrant student changes their course selections, and as a result, ends up taking an entirely online course load. Nonimmigrant students within the United States are not permitted to take a full course of study through online classes. If students find themselves in this situation, they must leave the country or take alternative steps to maintain their nonimmigrant status such as a reduced course load or appropriate medical leave.

Due to COVID-19, SEVP instituted a temporary exemption regarding online courses for the spring and summer semesters. This policy permitted nonimmigrant students to take more online courses than normally permitted by federal regulation to maintain their nonimmigrant status during the COVID-19 emergency.

F-1 nonimmigrant students pursue academic coursework and M-1 nonimmigrant students pursue vocational coursework while studying in the United States.

&#x200B;

\----

tl;dr

Full online fall 2020 = you may not enter or live in the US; probably have to continue living abroad

Full in-person fall 2020 = may take only one online class (3 credit hrs)

Hybrid fall 2020 = Form I-20 must indicate that the program isn't 100% online, not taking 100% online, and taking ""minimum"" number of online classes

Pretty sure this will significantly impact Penn int'l students who are going full online this fall",SEVP modifies temporary exemptions for nonimmigrant students taking online courses during fall 2020 semester,46,0.95,hmjmjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/hmjmjc/sevp_modifies_temporary_exemptions_for/,17,1594108679.0,2020-07-07 02:57:59

Rex1995,"After reading over Penn's response for what will happen in the fall, I am definitely thinking that we will have a mostly, if not entirely, online fall semester. My reasoning and thoughts on the subjects are as follows:

1. **Nothing will be normal again** until a vaccine is available for public use
2. There is no way that Covid-19 will be gone or ""less of a threat"" by August with states reopening and a **second wave of the virus is a certain possibility**
3. In the words of Prof. Max Mintz , "" I see **no way Penn can ethically invite thousands of students** in uncertain states of health from all over the world to come to Penn in  late August. ""
4. While there may be some in-class learning, I think that they might **offer students an option of coming back to campus** **if they feel like they want to/need** to but they will still record all lectures and post them online as well as have online assignments, exams, ect...

johnathanjones1998,"Note: This kinda expands on info from the penn admission website and the faq (https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/wiki/index). Read those first!

Since application season is starting up I thought it would be nice to make a small post about applying to Penn. But first off some background on the Penn application process itself:

Penn has 4 schools: the College (CAS), the school of engineering and applied sciences (SEAS), the Wharton business school (Wharton), and nursing. When you graduate from Penn, you will graduate with a degree in one of these four schools (or multiple degrees...but that will be addressed later on). Within each degree, you can have one or multiple majors. E.g. A person can have a degree from SEAS with two majors (in computer science and linguistics). Note that majors are somewhat school specific. For example, only engineering offers computer science majors, but they allow college students to get a computer science major as well. The college allows pretty much anyone from any school to get any of the college majors. Wharton does not allow you to get a major from them (if you are in another school) since they only offer a single degree with ""concentrations"". Nursing also only offers nursing degrees to their students (no majors like Wharton). 

  - A degree from a school entails with it some base requirements that are not necessarily specific to the major you get from the school. e.g. A college student will need to complete some base requirements (foundational, sector, and language requirements) in addition to their major. same with engineering. A person who chooses to do a degree + 1st major from the college and a second major from engineering will need to only do the base college requirements, their college major, and their engineering major (but not engineering requirements). 

- Dual degrees allow you to graduate with two degrees from two separate schools. There are two ways you can do this: uncoordinated and coordinated. For uncoordinated, you'll be doing base requirements for both schools plus the requirements for majors...which is a lot. You apply for an uncoordinated degree typically after your freshman year (the application process can be restrictive if you want a second degree in Wharton). Coordinated dual degree programs allow you to skip some of these requirements (but you will need to apply for these programs). The coordinated dual degree programs are listed here: http://www.admissions.upenn.edu/apply/specialized (That link also has some specialized programs that aren't dual degree). You can apply to these programs after your freshman year as well, but they are restrictive (req a high GPA after your freshman year). *General Advice: Apply for a dual degree program as your primary choice and a single degree as your second choice*. if you don't get the dual degree, you will still be considered for your second choice.

---
*Applying (how do I get in?)*: 

I won't go into how to fill out the common app since there are tons of resources for that already. But in general, your application should be focused on selling yourself and finding something that makes you unique. Focus on objective measures of how good you are/what you can contribute to Penn (and how you can take advantage of Penn's resources). Additionally, give some proof of your proficiency in doing something. For example, if you say you say you are a good programmer, then *show* that don't *tell* me (e.g. something about an app you've created and how you self-learned, got x amount of users, improved upon that, and how a formal CS education will help). 

If things haven't changed much, the general application essay is usually something along the lines of ""Why Penn?"". And tbh...the essay question sucks and leads to some fairly monotonous essays that are super cringeworthy when you read them. It's fine, just write it. The general format is ""I am good in X. Here is an example of how I was good in X, with some measures of success Y. Hey. omg. Penn has professor/program/major Z that does exactly X!"" and continue that for like 600 words.

*But what if I don't have anything to sell myself on?*

Make something to sell yourself with. Not everyone can be a national winner in FBLA or whatever, but there are numerous things you can do on your own that are impressive in their own right e.g. start a nonprofit, do research that gets published, write a novel, etc. Self-endeavors like the above are best for your application because a) they are impressive and b) you can't necessarily compare candidate A and candidate B without further research (and trust me...college admissions won't spend time researching your claims unless there is a huge red flag...take that as you may). 

*But what about my stats?*

Holistic admissions will only help so much. Your stats (GPA and SAT/ACT) are critical to your application. Think of your app like a cake, your stats are the base of the cake, extracurriculars are icing. Too little base makes the cake entirely icing which is going to be way too sweet (hence you won't like it too much...or at least I don't like too much icing...so the analogy is fitting from my perspective lol). 

So if you are from an average public school, some things admissions may want to see: you are at least in the top 10% of your class, are scoring in the 2250+ SAT Range (1500-1520 on new SAT) or a 33+ ACT range. If you are a URM (hispanic, african american, etc), you may have *some* leeway, but not too much. If you are asian (like me), max these stats since a lot of applicants' stats will be high as well (sorry...it sucks i know). Again, the leeway is entirely speculation on my part.

*When should I apply?*

If you have lower stats/know you want to go to penn, apply ED. You will be rewarded since it has a higher admit rate. Additionally, if you  are waitlisted in ED you have a slightly higher chance in RD (again, slight speculation). Note ED means you cannot apply to any other school ED but are free to apply to other schools EA (but not REA...but check your other school's policy for that). 

*What about dat $$$?* 

Penn's financial aid programs are very generous but consult with them if you have questions since everything is on a case by case basis. If you have concerns, talk to them sooner rather than later (this is more true when you get admitted). 

*What if I get in?*

Congrats! (Join our meme page and rejoice in the #struggle: https://www.facebook.com/groups/966590693376781/) 

*What if I don't get in?*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWVElQ6NfcE This application process is shitty. I will be the first one to say it. I mean think about it, like a total of 5 minutes will be spent screening an application you spent months putting together...there is just a ton of context you can't necessarily put into your application. Just take the rejection in stride, move on to the place that is best for you. Trust me, you will make new friends in new places + create new opportunities no matter what. Anyway, you will probs kill it in any other place. (and join our meme page anyway and laugh at our #struggle: https://www.facebook.com/groups/966590693376781/) 

*Can I PM you about X?*

In general, sure! But I won't give my application essays (bc I don't have them anymore) nor share any of my personal information. Besides, it would be best to post in the subreddit for more specific info (and better response times).","Read this before you post a ""How do I get into Penn/What are my chances"" post.",42,0.9,6ezm3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/6ezm3a/read_this_before_you_post_a_how_do_i_get_into/,5,1496496800.0,2017-06-03 08:33:20

Boutilimit,"CCB has received tenure. A huge burden is lifted off his shoulders. It has been on him for six years now, and he is so relieved to have this pressure removed, like taking off a tight bra after a month on. He at last feels at ease, confident even, and now that he has passed the final judgment of his peers you can see the professor's individuality begin to spark. Now is his hey day. He has his students call him ""Chris"" or even ""C.C."". He wears funky vintage shirts from his youth, with the top three buttons undone and his chest hairs aerating.

singularreality,"UPDATE So, happy to edit my post as follows:  I did not see that Penn has agreed for those living in Philadelphia in order to learn (off campus or on) to test upon arrival to Philadelphia and then again seven days later although it appears that testing is optional.  Thereafter testing is only for symptomatic persons at the House of Flags.  Also the campus compact remains in effect, although obviously it is more difficult to enforce.  So, there is some testing that is being made available and there is no mention of contact tracing.  This will definitely help to insure that students arriving in Philadelphia this fall have the opportunity (but not the requirement) to get tested. (I credit Yikes in this thread for correcting me on the campus pact being applicable to off campus housing this fall and that testing is available (but clearly not the same level of assistance).

""we recognize that some students who may travel to Philadelphia to continue to learn may inadvertently carry the disease. To address this, and in light of the public health impact of students coming to Philadelphia from various regions of the United States and the world, we will be offering any student who will be learning from Philadelphia the opportunity to be tested upon arrival and again seven days later, at no cost to them. This will allow us to quickly identify positive cases and trigger the requisite isolation in order to prevent the spread of the disease. Should students develop any symptoms during the semester, we will be offering COVID-19 testing to all members of the Penn community in the Hall of Flags. In addition, we ask all students who will be traveling to Philadelphia from states with a high incidence of COVID-19 to adhere to the recommended 14-day quarantine upon arrival to Pennsylvania. ""

I think this makes it easier for those who decide to learn in Philadelphia to stay safe, but it is not the same, of course, as the what the protocols would have been if we had a hybrid fall...

&#x200B;

We have debated the campus opening for weeks and the merits of a ""hybrid"" opening that turned into a live on campus, not really hybrid (mostly online) opening, that has now turned into an all online disappointment for most (some of you are saying phew!).  Whether the right decision or not, one has to ask why testing planned and contracted for became unavailable in a matter of weeks or why quarantining all those from hot spots would be so difficult if the affected persons understood and were willing to endure the process. (Yes that would be tough.) But I defer to the wisdom of those that have the hard job of implementation... not fun to have to make that call.

Does anyone else wonder if college administrators across the country anticipated that whether they had an online experience or a hybrid one, their campuses would simply shift a little to the north, south, east or west, because this is, especially in their senior year (but in others as well), their home, the place where their independence thrives and their support congregates?  At Penn, I am seeing posts and reports of large portions of the student body securing off campus housing to create their version of Plan C, the Off Campus Campus for university life.  Before I ask the tough question, I hope and wish that all students act responsibly on their Off Campus campuses and wear masks, social distance, wash hands and not gather in crowds.  And, I hope they will comply with the campus pact  even though it would not involve the exquisitely best laid plans of Penn before Penn threw in the proverbial hybrid towel.  After all, you want to be able to return to the old Campus in the Spring (or will you).

So, did we just go from

1. a Hybrid model that would have all willing and less vulnerable students on campus (perhaps 75%+ of the students),  living  under a very strict code of conduct, with regular and targeted testing, mask wearing and distance living and eating, away from their parents most older persons and the main part of the City....

to

2 (a)  Perhaps as many as 50+% of Penn students living in some proximity of Penn in the new Off Campus Campus without the same access to regular  testing, contact tracing and/or quarantine options.   and  2(b) the remainder living at home with their older parents and siblings and perhaps grandparents and vulnerable persons while not necessarily in a position to quarantine or adhere to CDC guidelines and still occasionally and out of necessity getting haircuts, going to an outdoor restaurant, working, meeting with friends, studying in a library etc.... ??? \[this was modified to recognize that the campus pact is indeed still in effect.  But testing and contact tracing etc. and other rules will not be the same.

What will be the ultimate effect of the decision ?  Of course, Penn will not be ""responsible"" for what happens health-wise during the fall.  So, the question: Will students be better off, the same or worse as compared to Penn's latest and originally cancelled plan????...I will leave it to you or father time to answer that one.  In the movie Jurassic Park, those stubborn, life loving dinosaurs figured out a way to survive and become independent and do the things that, well they do....  Students across the country are making their modified campuses and fighting dependence and isolation instinctually and there is nothing any of us can do about that, except maybe, give them back their true campus and provide them with more tools to stay safe?

Kosko_s,"Text from Email:

""We are today announcing that a statue of George Whitefield that was erected in the Quad in the early twentieth-century will be removed from our campus. We make this change after careful consideration of what it means for our campus community, both now and into the future. The case for removing Whitefield is overwhelmingly strong. He was a well-known evangelical preacher in the mid-eighteenth century, who notably led a successful campaign to allow slavery in Georgia. This is undeniably one of Whitefield’s principal legacies. Honoring him with a statue on our campus is inconsistent with our University’s core values, which guide us in becoming an ever more welcoming community that celebrates inclusion and diversity.

Whitefield’s connection to Penn stems from a church meeting house he owned at 4th and Arch streets in Philadelphia which was purchased by Ben Franklin to house the Academy of Philadelphia, a predecessor to the University of Pennsylvania. Given that Whitefield prominently advocated for slavery, there is absolutely no justification for having a statue honoring him at Penn.

Over the past few years, members of our community involved in the Penn and Slavery Project have done important research that has helped the University better understand its early history, and we are grateful for their work. It is important that we fully understand how the institution of slavery—a profoundly shameful and deeply tragic part of American history—affected Penn in its early years and that we reflect as a university about the current meaning of this history. Penn recognizes that some of its trustees, including our founder Benjamin Franklin, had owned enslaved persons. Importantly, Franklin changed course in his life and went on to become a leading abolitionist.

To ensure that we have a more complete understanding of the history that is reflected on our campus, we are also announcing the formation of a Campus Iconography Group. This group will engage in broad outreach across our community and advise us on further steps to ensure that the placement and presence of statues and other prominent iconography better reflects our achievements and aspirations to increase the diversity of the Penn community. We want to do our best to fulfill our firm commitment to being the most inclusive, innovative and impactful university.""",Penn Announces Plans to Remove Statue of George Whitefield in Quad,39,0.84,hjz09m,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/hjz09m/penn_announces_plans_to_remove_statue_of_george/,30,1593732271.0,2020-07-02 18:24:31

I'm back on campus now, still in Harrison, just a different room and my stuff is gone. Called the moving company and they said the movers already brought my boxes back to Harrison, but clearly it's not here and Harrison doesn't know where it is. They said they checked some ""possible"" rooms that it could be in (my old room, previous assignments, rooms in my hall) but they said they can't find it. They said they'll keep looking next week when they check to see who's failed to move in on campus, but I'm just living in an empty room right now unsure if I should buy stuff I need. Im not from a rich family, so I can't be spending money on things to buy stuff only to have duplicates if they do find my stuff. All my clothes, kitchenware, bathroom stuff, bed sheets, literally everything dorm related is gone. I've been emailing and calling the moving company and Harrison, but not hearing much from them.

Personally, I have no idea whether the information at hand is true or not, but for those of you who are thinking about mentioning aspects of the rumor at hand and its potential sources, please keep the following rules in mind:

1. Reddit site-wide policy: NO DOXXING. Rule of thumb: if any person can figure out who you are talking about just by looking at your post description and googling, it should probably not be up in this subreddit, especially if it is about a student.
2. Be respectful to others. I've seen a fair amount of toxic language as a result of clashes between the ""stay at home"" vs ""go back to Penn"" side of things and that shouldn't be happening.
3. No misinformation. Please do your best to do due diligence and verify the source of your claim.

burnie_2020,"Thoughts? Online classes don't seem to be able to replace the education we paid and will pay for. Many of us paid nation-leading tuition and fees to come to Penn to interact with faculty and fellow students in a dynamic and enriching environment. Does it make sense to continue charging or paying full tuition in this far from normal time? Stores refund defective products, would it be too much to ask to make a slight comparison? And if this continues into the Fall and beyond, what of the freshmen for whom a live environment is critical for their next chapter into university life? What about students who took on substantial debt to come here? It doesn't seem fair even to those who can more easily afford this.

Many executives at for profit companies have already voluntarily forgoed parts of their salary... wouldn't a nice endowment and competitive packages paid to certain administrators have room for such times?

Tastypita,"Went to Penn Apps XIX this past weekend at UPenn. I'd like to start off by stating that I'm a visiting student from a university outside of PA.  This was not my first time attending an event like this. This was however, my first time at UPenn. And damn, do I really regret going to this ""hackathon.""

Let's start with the application process. The applications for Penn Apps were not only vague, but also disturbingly biased. Although the applications stated ""no past hackathon experience required"" it still assumed that  applicants had experience in one of 3 ""routes."" If you didn't have experience, well, you could   
A) Give up right there, or  
B) Lie

(you can guess which option most people took).

 Why didn't they just keep it simple? I've never had to fill out so much just to go to another generic college hackathon.. 

best part - Penn Apps received high school applicants who were unaware it was college-students only and rejected all of them.

The trip was fine. Took a coach bus. The organizers posted about a shuttle bus but it was only for students at specific universities. Shoutout to the organizers for giving awesome directions and bus routes to your school (they didn't email out any information whatsoever) Found my thanks to Maps, or else I'd probably have gotten lost.

Most of the entrances into the Penn Apps building were locked. Eventually some student was nice enough to open the door for me and another person. Finally made my way in and registered and went to the opening ceremony, hosted by MLH (lol).

MLH is a joke. Enough said. Their judging makes no sense and half the shit they promised was never delivered. That's no surprise. What more can you expect from a scam.

Teambuilding. I think it goes without saying that if you're coming to a hackathon you should try to form a team, either beforehand or onsite. There was 0 teambuilding offered by Penn Apps, and if there was then I'm sorry but ya'll didn't do a good job. The teams were terribly made. Majority of people left before the next day. The rest stuck it out or joined teams hoping to make a ""something."" Around 3-5 hours in, the organizers suddenly thought it was a great idea to  to kick everyone out of the rooms on the 3rd floor and cram them into the 2nd and 1st. This led to people flooding the rooms and taking whatever space they could for themselves. The rooms were fantastic. Picture 20+ people cramped together in a small classroom with chairs, a desk, and no tables for 10 hours. That was Penn Apps. 

&#x200B;

There were tables set up outside the rooms but there was barely enough to fit all the teams. People ran down the hallways desperately trying to find seating. I think I saw one poor guy spend an hour trying to find his team. My own teammate ditched us at 9. I don't blame him. After all, he didn't know it was a 24-hour hackathon. THAT'S RIGHT. PENN APPS FAILED TO TELL PEOPLE IT WAS 24 HOURS. Some people even came in with the expectation that it was 48 hours.

There were around 150-180 people at the opening ceremonies. By morning the next day, there were less than half. The workshops were not good. I would have attended more but they ended on the first day. Penn Apps barely had any companies sponsoring. Saw maybe 2 there, but none that made the trip actually worth it.   


The night ended and closing ceremonies happened and that was it. A really disappointing experience honestly. I didn't know what to expect coming to Penn Apps. I've been to a couple hackathons. This was really shitty. I thought the surrounding area was nice though.

I think the biggest piece of feedback I can give to Penn Apps/the organizers is to definitely improve on communication and emails. Not everyone uses Facebook or wants to join your facebook group. Learn to share information widely and spread that shit. Travel, commute, schedules, workshops every other piece of info should be shared widely and through email. For me though, definitely not going back to Penn Apps.",Penn Apps XIX Recap,30,0.91,ao15wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/ao15wt/penn_apps_xix_recap/,6,1549552040.0,2019-02-07 09:07:20

johnathanjones1998,"Just summarizing what I've seen so far + my own experience:  
CAS: you're limited to 4.5 CU. If you're premed, basically take 1 science course + the lab (1.5 CU), writing sem, and any two other courses (one of which could be possibly math 104/114). If you want to switch into wharton, make sure you have 4 CU at min and and take Math 104/114 + econ 001 (if you have AP credits...idk). MLS kids...you do you (but basically follow the guide on the website).  


SEAS: Go cray. Anything around 5-5.5 is considered average. Anything above that should only be done if you're planning to go on the dual degree route. CIS people: no pressure to take 160 your first sem. Also note that 110/120 + 160 is a lot of work, so take some lighter courses with that (unless you know discrete math already).   


Wharton: Idk (ppl can comment below)  


Nursing: Idk (ppl can comment below)

InternationalCupcake,"I know there aren't a lot of LPS folks on here, but I also know that many traditional undergraduates add evening LPS sections during the add / drop period to fill out / modify their schedules. So this is a warning: do not add this class.

&#x200B;

The first meeting was last night. I noticed that at the last minute, the instructor for the course was changed from Edward Crotty to someone named Peiwen Tan. Well, apparently the department neglected to inform Mr. Crotty of this fact. About 5 minutes into class, he showed up and was very confused / somewhat (and justifiably!) angry at finding out he was no longer teaching the class. Words were exchanged in the hallway.

&#x200B;

Then class continued. Peiwen Tan is, I'm sure, a lovely person. This is her first time teaching at Penn. I googled around, and found students at Temple had the same concern as me: almost impossible to understand a word she is saying due to accent. 

&#x200B;

Nothing personal against her, but this is an LPS section for Calc 1. This class is full of students that are either still in highschool and haven't yet taken this level of Calc, or for old fucks like me that last took Calc like 10 years ago. So there's already a big challenge for us in getting back up to speed. Add in the fact that we literally can't understand the words coming out of the professor's mouth, and this is a recipe for disaster.

onekrustykrabtacopls,"Hi guys, quick rant.

I'm sure you all know that the University said that all work-study students should continue to get paid for their regular hours. My work was already considered remote, but my circumstances have changed significantly—I now have to share a computer with my siblings who don't have one, support a family of 4 with a $200/week because my parents are unemployed, all while working with an unstable wifi connection. 

Now, my employer refuses to continue to pay me for the 20 hours/week I was working at Penn, because half of it is coming from her own grants. She insists that I only submit the hours I'm able to work, despite knowing of my financial/living situation. I've called SFS multiple times and they've all told me that I'm supposed to be getting paid for my regular hours because of the extenuating circumstances, but she doesn't seem to give a fuck. I'm FGLI and have been pushed out of Penn and back into a country that is doing *nothing* to prevent the spread of the virus; I have enough shit to worry about.

I've already emailed student employment but waiting for a reply. I'd appreciate any tips.


Update: turns out she told student employment that I was originally meant to work 10 hours and that she had told me she was worried that I wouldn't be able to succeed academically if I did more, so they told me that it was untenable for me to continue to submit 20 hours. She said this because I was signed up for 10 hours at the beginning *by mistake* and she obviously tried to use it to her advantage. I replied to student employment with the evidence that it wasn't true, and she just emailed me saying that ""to save everyone's time"" she would continue to approve my 20 hours.

ifuckedmyselfatpenn,"Hey y'all,

Some of you might remember me from a shitshow of a post nearly 2 years ago when I got kicked out for a year. I took a couple of years off and finally decided(they allowed me too) to come back a semester ago.

So I failed CIS 240 2 years ago, I have no intention of failing it again. But I'm pretty ill-prepared to take it. I have a month and some change to study and prepare for it, and I was looking for some advice. 

This is my current understanding of the course:

First Third - Basic electronics crap. Gates and all. Pretty straightforward


Second Third - Assembly and the LC4 processor
How do I exactly prepare for this? I remember the professor diverted from the processor mentioned in the book(Patt and Patel) and we had a ton of assignments I absolutely bombed. To prepare for this would you reccomend just grinding through the book? Or is there someother resource you all would reccomend?

Final Third: Writing stuff in C and the terrifying compiler thing. 
So I had given up on the course before getting to this part last time around. But now I have a lot more experience. I have spent the better part of last year writing web apps, and did CIS 121 last semester. I hadn't even taken CIS 120 before my first attempt at CIS 240. So I have some basic programming maturity but nothing in the realm of C. To prepare for this part which seems to be the most daunting, I decided to follow this guide:

*  https://www.learn-c.org/

A lot of the content here is pretty similar to stuff we learn in CIS 120/121. I'm halfway through the advanced topics mentioned there, but the idea of building a compiler for a language still terrifies the living fuck out of me. I don't think I can do that at my current level. 

So any recommendations for this third of the course? Stuff I should definitely know and internalize?

I'm sorry for my long stream of consciousness post but this one course has me weirdly stressed out. Feel free to PM me if you are not comfortable posting publicly. I'm pretty anxious about this course and would appreciate any and all help.

Also, as a PS I just want to say a massive thank-you to the people here to helped me out last time. I received some very level headed advice, personal stories of dealing with the same crap and encouragement which really led me to change the course of my life. I appreciated all of you very much.

,"I'm 99% committed to Penn (they offered me the most money and are the best ranked school I was accepted to, plus I just like it a lot).

suburbanoutfitters,"EDIT: IF YOU WANT THEM TO CHANGE IT GO TO THIS WEBSITE AND ADVOCATE AGAINST PENN’S CURRENT POLICY! https://forms.gle/2kHgznKVF9gBoQH46

Hi everyone! I am wondering if people on here prefer this semester’s P/F policy that was announced yesterday, or would rather have it changed to be like other schools that are letting students complete the semester (and see their cumulative course grades) before deciding whether the classes will be letter graded or P/F. I would love to know what you think!

My personal thoughts: I believe it SHOULD be changed (new deadline should be end of May at least) because a large hurdle of virtual learning is that we may not be able to study well for the final exam, research effectively for a final paper, make an amazing presentation via Zoom, etc due to our individual at-home circumstances. Hence, having to opt into P/F by the 13th April will not help people who, due to the nature of virtual learning, end up getting low grades on their finals/term papers/large projects. I, for one, have no clue how I am doing in a class right now because we have very few scores right now (70% of the class grade is based on a final in May and a paper due after the new P/F deadline).

I have also spoken to a friend who has to watch her siblings full-time at home (parents both work in healthcare and cannot take time off during this pandemic) and is struggling to even prepare for virtual school this coming week. She also advocates for extending the deadline, and believes it would alleviate pressure. It is also a policy that other universities (public and private alike) are adopting.

insidetheivylife,"   I’m writing my story in light of the rash of suicides at Penn. I will never be able to bring those lives back or take away the pain of the loved ones who have lost. My hope instead is that I can provide even one person the knowledge that it’s okay to speak up because even when no one else is listening, I will. 

   Ever since these tragedies began, I have wondered what it could possibly be about Penn that drove so many people to this way out. I read the news articles and heard the opinions of people speculating why. I sat and listened to the idea that we are overachievers, destined to this fate by the fact that we can’t accept failure. I read about the lack of resources (a contested point, but nonetheless one that has been raised) or lack of quality of resources available. Still, it wasn’t until I started here that I truly understood. 

  Before I came to Penn, I had an amazing support system in place. The people I knew spoke of mental illness like it was something as benign as where you live. I realize now I was lucky. And I realize now how hard it can be to leave that behind or to have never had it at all. I came here and quickly realized that I could no longer talk to anyone about who I was or how I suffered. I quickly realized my kind wasn’t accepted. I was prepared to deal with a place where I felt the institution didn’t care for my kind. What I wasn’t prepared for was a place where I felt like I wasn’t welcome by my fellow students. 

   When I started Penn I quickly made many friends. It sounds like the start of your typical suicide story here. He/she was so popular or had so many people that cared. He/she went to Penn. How could he/she do this? And on the surface it would seem like I have so many people who will listen. Meeting people have never been a problem for me. Someone once said to me I immediately make anyone feel like he or she is my closest friend. The truth is, though, I never have trouble meeting people because I only do it when I’m manic. I bounce from person to person with seemingly boundless energy and I never stop joking with them. Because I’m in school, no one would ever think it’s because I’m manic. Instead people assume I’ve had enough drinks that I’m friendly and loud. I let them assume, because it gives me hope I can be that person. I try every day to be the person they think I am when I meet them. I want to be happy and carefree. I want to be uninhibited in the completely benign way they are expecting. 

   As my first semester here went on, though, things began to change. I’ve known for years I have bipolar disorder. I always hope if I try hard enough it will go away. That’s why I live in fear when I feel myself start to become angry all the time. I know this is another side of my mania, but it’s one I always hope won’t hit me again. Sometimes I wonder if this is worse than my depression, because this is what ruins my relationships with others most of all. Instead of retreating, I wake up every day and tell myself I will overcome. So I go out and instead of recognizing what’s going on I go out. I drink. I sleep with people I barely know even though I hate myself for it. I yell at them for not being the person I expected, even though I never knew them. I hear about the things they say behind my back. I’m easy. I’m forward. I start to feel worse. I get more determined to change my life and get it back on track. I meet more people. I start the cycle again. 

   In the meantime, I turned to yelling at my friends for anything and everything. I apologize. I get told I don’t mean it. What they don’t realize is that not only am I apologizing for what I said, but I’m also apologizing for who I am. They tell me to just not be this way anymore. They warn me about the dangers of being me. I wish I could tell them who I really am. Some days I wonder if even I know who I am. Instead I continue to apologize but I also grow angrier because they can’t accept me. So I tried telling someone I thought was a close friend. To this day, I’m not sure if he knew. But to this day, we don’t speak about it. Instead he continues to warn me to try to not be the way I am. So one day I tried to speak to him about mental health issues in general, tiptoeing around the uncomfortable fact that we both knew they affected one of us and the other lived in a world where they were seemingly nonexistent. I told him about the frustration of not being able to talk. I told him about the times I’ve felt guilty for being one of the friends of someone who has taken their life, and how I wished I had just taken five seconds of my time to ask how they were and check in. He insists I couldn’t have known they were going through something, because no one would even consider not asking if they had an idea. Perhaps I didn’t, but I knew there was suffering, even if I didn’t know how bad it was. Sometimes I wonder if when I reach out he shuts down the conversation because he doesn’t want to have the uncomfortable conversation where I say I’m not ok. I tell him I think sometimes even when people recognize something is different they might not ask because of that very reason. He says I’m being unfair. Let’s be honest though. We’re uncomfortable talking about mental illness and suicide. He’s uncomfortable talking about it. I become uncomfortable talking about it too, and feel shut in. 

   Soon I feel another change come over me. I never used to know when it was coming, but now I recognize it. At first I ignored it and lived my life like I normally would. Everything in class seemed fine because I was so determined to show people I was. What they didn’t know was that in the winter every day I walked to or from school I looked for any way I could take my life on my way there. I couldn’t walk over a bridge without thinking of how easy it would be. Sometimes I slowed down to walk, giving myself time do it if I wanted. Still, I knew if I did it I wouldn’t be one of those people who teetered over the edge prolonging my last moments. Instead I thought of how easy it would be to run and jump over the edge. I wanted to just let the momentum carry me. Sometimes I felt like the momentum was already carrying me over the edge. 

   I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to explain to people what it’s like to want to save yourself when you also want to take your own life. Sometimes it feels like I’m two people, and some days I wasn’t sure which one I would become. So I stopped going to class. I was afraid to walk to school because I was afraid I wouldn’t make it. I thought staying inside in my bed was the only way to stay alive. Every day I was living in fear of myself. 

   When I did go out, it confirmed my fear that I had to live my life as a secret. I went out to parties but barely had the energy to make conversation. Drink, people told me. They thought it would bring back who I was. I didn’t have the heart to tell them it wasn’t drunk me they knew, it was manic me. Still, they thought alcohol would bring back the personality they once knew. I was told I wasn’t likable as who I became. I knew it was true. Even when I wasn’t depressed and wasn’t manic, I was shy. I was boring. I had no personality. Truth be told, I often wonder if I have a personality outside my illness. Sometimes I wonder if it’s why so many people like me are resistant to treatment or why they stop once they start. I know for so long it’s what scared me about treatment. And once I did, I had a new set of issues to struggle with. I wondered where I went and who I was. Others had their whole lives to figure this out, and I was told that who I knew myself to be was nothing but an illness. Some people called it a disability. It made me angry to think some people considered my very sense of self and personality a disability. My shame got worse. 

   At times I have heard people around me here discuss mental illness. The times that strike me most are times when they talk about bipolar disorder, because even though they don’t realize it they’re talking about me. I’ve heard jokes told about the crazy things bipolar people do. I’ve heard others question if anyone would ever really do that. I don’t have the heart to say I’ve done it. I listen to the stories about the nonsensical rants, the many started and unfinished projects, the seemingly unending list of partners, the addictions, the wild uninhibited decisions and trips. I listen to a biography of my life, but at the same time I listen to people laugh at how absurd it is that anyone could do those things. It seems everything I do and everything I hear adds to my shame. I grow more depressed and feel more alone. 

   I finally did find two people I could open up to, however. After months of being shamed or shunned for my illness when I tried to open up, I found two friends who help me get through everything. One suffers from depression and so understands at least part of what I’m going through. We opened up to each other, but also talked about how we felt we couldn’t talk to anyone else. It was perhaps one of the best and worst conversations I’ve had here.  I found someone who understood and wouldn’t judge me, but it also confirmed my fear that I wasn’t alone in not being able to speak up. Others felt this way too. The other person I spoke to though gave me hope in a very different way because he has never suffered from mental illness. Still, he understands that I do. He’s empathetic and helps me get through everything while realizing I can’t change completely. He understands when I can’t stop crying. He understands when I can’t stop screaming, even if I’m screaming at him. He knows what I mean when I apologize and doesn’t question how sorry I am because he knows every day I’m trying to get better. And the truth is I am getting better every day. I’ll always live with my mental illness, but I know now that I will live with it not die from it. 

   All it takes is one person to listen. Still, they have to truly listen. All it takes is one person to recognize anything. That a friend has stopped eating, stopped hanging out, stopped going to class, or just doesn’t seem right. All it takes is one person to ask. I think there are a lot of institutional problems at Penn that make it hard for people dealing with these issues to get help (and believe me, I still have trouble accessing help here). I think, though, that we can’t expect Penn to make a change when we don’t demand it. When we don’t even seem to care if it ever happens. When we treat suicides like an inevitable part of life instead of a preventable tragedy. It is preventable. I can say that, because mine was prevented by two people who cared enough to check up and sincerely ask how I was doing. But we can’t expect Penn to do that for us until we show them that we do it for each other. I’m telling my story because I know there are other people there who are going through what I’ve been through. I’m sharing my story so you will ask your friend about his or her story. So that you will tell him or her it’s ok to suffer sometimes because so many of us do. Every day I’m getting better, but every day I want to strive to make this a place where the people who did take their own lives could have said that, and where the people who are considering it now will soon say that. Still, just like I couldn’t deal with my illness on my own, I can’t do this on my own either. It took one person asking the question to help me, but it takes us all asking the question to help Penn. And when we leave here, let’s not forget that the suffering extends beyond these walls. Let’s keep asking. And speak up, Penn. I'm listening.

CermaSL,"Hi guys, I'm a sophomore at Drexel actually who's always been interested in dance for a long long time. I've definitely watched hundreds of videos since middle school (Kinjaz, One million dance studio, Kyle Hanagami, Keone and Mari, Dance competitions,  etc.) but there's never really been a dance scene around where I lived to get into and upon searching for urban dance studios in Philly I only found ballet studios and ballroom dance studios. There aren't any dance groups on campus that fit what I'm going for either. I thought college would be my time to really get into the type of dance I wanted but it has yet to happen. I've taken jazz technique one and ballet technique one (classes here at Drexel) just to kinda scratch that itch my body has to move and, even though I enjoy it, it's not really my thing. I plan to try out hip hop technique one when I have room in my schedule.




I'm mainly into Urban/Hip-Hop dance, I really want to learn how to pop and lock and hit. I'm not really trying to learn ballet or modern.  I just attended a kpop dance workshop with kbeats (the kpop dance group at Penn) and I had a really fun time so I'm totally down to learn kpop too!




It's been an unrequited dream of mine to learn how to dance and I really think I've explored many avenues in order to, so far, not achieve this goal. I also think specific instruction is far superior to group instruction. I'm 100% willing to put in the practice and effort required to pick up this skill and learn choreography. I'm sure we could find somewhere either on Penn or Drexel campus to practice. If anyone thinks they could spare some of their valuable free time (I know we're all very busy haha) to help out an eager student, please reply to this post or message me!  As you can tell I'm quite excited and I thought that perhaps reaching out to Penn students would help me fine people that might be interested!","Is anyone who knows how to dance willing to teach me, pretty much a beginner, how to dance?

Phil_Pennster,"There is a huge amount of misunderstanding on the part of those who are so sad and frightened right now about the election.  I want to write and correct some of it.  I realize that Trump is a two-faced, immoral, unqaulified asshole.   He is a despicable human being on many levels.  On the other hand, I accept Clinton as a lifelong public servant, superbly qualified, and I am not the least bit bothered by all the nonsense about her email.  

Why then would I ever vote for Trump?  Because I'm white, male, straight, and angry.   I've done alright here at Penn, no major complaints.  There are opportunities closed to me because of the need for ""diversity"", because too many white men have gotten them in the past.  They must go to a woman, a minority, or at least a gay man - regardless of qualifications.  I've learned that I  might as well not even apply.   But that's not what makes me angry.

I'm angry because my work and expertise is disregarded and even suppressed.  I am often on the other side with admissions and faculty recruitments.  I cant go after the best qualified ones because we need diversity.  So many times, here at Penn, I have dligently worked to identify 10 superb candidates for some purpose only to be told that 3 women is not enough - gender equity demands that I replace 2 men with women, even though the pool is only 15% women.  How many search committees have I been on where we rank the applicants, and all my work to identify the best ones is overruled by a dean or administrator who reaches way down the list to take a woman or a minority.

I'm especially angry at political correctness, and the practical limits on my freedom of expression.  If I ever voiced an opinion against the kind of diversity criteria being applied, or rather if I didnt enthusiastically support the kind of diversity criteria being applied, I would be ostracized severely, perhaps even to the point of being driven away.  Me and my opinions are not at all 'safe' here at Penn.  Hows that for tolerance?  Where can we even discuss the downside of putting up 2 obviously much less qualified women in a public forum alongside 5 much better qualified men (and 3 much better qualified women)?  Those selected on account of the need for diversity stick out like a sore thumb.  I don't think that helps level the playing field, but I could have my professional career ended for speaking up and saying that.

So why Trump?  Because he tramples political correctness.  Because he tells the country that you are not electing someone because THEY deserve to be president, but because the country needs to have a job done.  Because a president needs to be mean to get things done sometimes.  The best way to deal with foreign leaders is to be unpredictable, and Trump is that.  He will not hesitate to fight republicans as well as democrats.   He will disrupt the status quo.  As a country, we desperately need that.",Why I supported Donald Trump,21,0.69,5cnx7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/5cnx7k/why_i_supported_donald_trump/,18,1479033121.0,2016-11-13 04:32:01

mongoose_with_rabies,"Shocker, not your usual post about writing sem on this page

What are peoples' thoughts on why writing sem is so infamously awful at Penn? As a class that's supposed to be central to the Penn undergraduate experience, you would expect them to put a lot of work into making it a really worthwhile experience, and it really isn't. And clearly it's not just a result of it being a course that satisfies distribution requirements, because I've had a lot of those classes be really high quality. It seems like it gets a fair amount of attention as far as the way the courses are conducted, with the involvement of the online peer review system, different course topics each year, lots of standardization amongst instructors on what's being taught. It's also not a result of having a bad English department necessarily, nor lack of prestige that would draw good instructors. As a bio major, a lot of the intro level classes I've taken have been the poorest in terms of instructor enthusiasm or lecturing capacity, but I even had a super kind and enthusiastic instructor (Lawrence Abbott) who you could tell really cared about the students, and yet I got nothing out of that class. Ok, I got maybe a handful of minutes of good introspection about my own writing habits, but really not 1.0CU's worth.

I'm genuinely curious what other peoples' thoughts are about how and why it's ended up this way.

Some theories that have crossed my mind: (note that I don't completely believe any of these)

* lack of sorting into different levels means that almost everyones needs are unmet - good writers are unchallenged, less-good writers fall through the cracks
* writing is inherently more difficult to teach than a lot of other subjects because it's not content or discussion driven? or that peoples' writing and thinking styles are inherently different, and that's hard to teach to
* nobody has a particular passion for teaching a universally required writing seminar that no one wants to be in
* people have complained about it to the extent that it has been deeply watered down. Alternatively the culture of shit talking writing sem leads people to drag their feet through the course without attempting to get anything out of it
* Penn has more important things to care about I guess? Just seems like with the amount of resistance it gets, they'd do better

In general, I support the idea that college students should be required to meet a standard of writing, be it a class or a test. While I did my fair share of grumping about having to take it (to the point that I took it senior year), I think I genuinely tried to find ways that the course was challenging me to think and improve my writing, and I still feel like it really missed the mark.",Discussion on writing sem,19,0.88,errzmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/errzmm/discussion_on_writing_sem/,2,1579625552.0,2020-01-21 10:52:32

Ice_Hawk86,"Hi,

I have a few questions about Penn Clubs as a rising high school senior interested in Penn:

1. Are Penn/Wharton clubs exclusive?  I've heard mixed opinions on this one, and apparently some clubs need an application for a chance to get in like Consulting / Investment, and do not accept that many freshman
2. When do clubs start?  Is there a 'club season' that Penn determines or are clubs run freely by the club presidents?
3. What is the normal time commitment for clubs (e.g. x hours per week)?  
4. At what time do clubs occur?  Before classes, lunch, after classes?  Or all three?
5. At what year could you apply for a committee/board position of a club?  Do you have to be a member in it already to then apply for the higher positions?
6. Usually how many clubs would you do in freshman year?  I really want to try out as many as possible!

 

For reference, I'm looking at the below clubs:

\- Wharton Investment and Trading Group

\- Wharton Undergraduate Finance Club

\- Wharton Undergraduate Consulting Club

\- Penn International Impact Consulting

\- PennSEM

&#x200B;

If I were to be accepted to the clubs above (idk how rigorous it is to get in but let's just assume), how many would be a healthy number to try out (or which ones)?  I really want to do all but I don't think that's possible haha - it really depends on the time commitment per week.

upliftguide,"Hello on behalf of the UpLIFT Team! We wanted to reach out on behalf of a new medical student-led organization at the Perelman School of Medicine. Our mission is to create a more equitable medical workforce by providing prospective applicants from Under-represented, Low Income, and First Time student backgrounds with access to comprehensive, up-to-date information about successfully applying and matriculating into medical school. We believe no one should have their dreams denied because valuable information was locked behind paywalls.

We believe in providing lower-resourced applicants with a comprehensive, well-compiled, free resource that is tailored to their experience and the challenges they face, especially for students who may have less access to mentors or advising due to remote school and additional challenges posed by COVID, and for students who may benefit from but can’t afford pricey consulting packages.

Our current guidebook contains over 18 chapters and 200 pages of content, covering everything from the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and interview tips to scholarship programs and more.

DeepRaspberry,"Hi, first post on here but I've been really conflicted on what to do with my first semester. I'm an international student from Asia and I have the option to move into Penn on my own, I have a single in Hill House. But my family is strongly advising me to live with my sister in her home in the States for the first semester. They're very anxious about the spread of the virus in Philly and tbh, I'm also anxious about the notion of being stuck in my dorm for most of the day and since it's my first big move amidst a global pandemic, I wouldn't mind being with family at least for the first few months. 

But at the same time, I'm scared I'm going to miss out on important firsts this semester. I know that according to the compact, social distancing and face covers will be strictly implemented, that we can't have any guests outside of campus and that most activities will be online anyways, but I'm very anxious of the notion of making new friends and feeling like the outsider in spring. 

These are just some of my thoughts on the top of my head. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys :)",Going online for my freshman fall?

sunflowersunday012,"I'm going to be a senior, and while I would love to experience my senior fall at Penn I don't know if it's worth it given the situation. I have a pretty good home life, so my reasoning for going back would be for my social life and because I'm supposed to be living off campus and am paying rent (though I could try to sublet). I'm living with two friends, and most of my other friends are either returning or are still undecided. I guess I have a little FOMO- that if I don't return to campus I'll miss out on catching up with people and whatever socializing does happen (with people other than my roommates- socially distant, wearing masks). Because of Covid, I'm almost positive that all of my classes are going to be online and I don't know if the reality is I'll be stuck in my room/apartment most of the time and become miserable. I am really good friends with my roommates, but I just don't know what the situation will be if it ends up we're together nearly 24/7 and  we only see other people in a very limited capacity. Is anyone else feeling the same way? What are you planning on doing?

My former roommate got stuck in London back in March, since he was back home during university spring break. Long story short, he completed his masters program remotely in the UK and I need to ship his belongings back to him since it's unlikely he will be able to enter to US for months.

USPS is the cheapest at ~$600, but I am totally lost when it comes to filling out the customs form.

StarFishMd,"Due to school and work obligations, I stayed over at my Campus Apts place over this summer. In the earlier part of summer, the apartment complex felt safe. My neighbors observed safe distancing protocols. There was minimal movement of guests, if any at all. UCD wasn't densely crowded as well. 

However, things have changed for the worse over the past few week and I worry this could be a leading indicator of how the Fall semester looks like. New residents have moved into my apartment complex and they seem far more lax about safety protocols and the amount of guest movement is unprecedented (even by pre-covid standards).  

 It took me a while to make sense of this. I think there is a case of adverse selection. Folks who are prudent generally wouldn't return to campus. We are still about a month away from school reopening I worry things could worsen.

,"I've never posted here before, and I'm sorry if my inquiry seems insensitive (because of her circumstances) but I just got done reading ""What Made Maddy Run.""

I don't go to UPenn, nor am I an athlete, but I identify somewhat academically with what Madison experienced: doing well enough to get into a well-regarded university and then realizing in college that I'm perhaps just average, or slightly above average academically, becoming really depressed (to the point of withdrawing--in my case, not hers) because of that + not knowing how to cope. 

Maybe this isn't the best subreddit to ask, but yeah, does anyone have any words of advice/insight?

I didn't run track and I don't play any sports at the college level, nor am I as attractive/well-liked, but I guess I see myself in her academically. I think she got a 3.5 her first semester at Penn. I got a similar GPA around that last semester (second semester freshman year) and I was extremely disappointed, as was she. 

I've discussed her case this my parents, and they said, quite bluntly, that she and students in a similar situation needed to ""get out of their HS bubble and face reality"" meaning that they should've realized that they are at UPenn, a very competitive institution, and that A's and good grades are harder to obtain. They also said that maybe they were never very smart to begin with and that their HS was just really easy or whatever. 

In fact, for me, they said that a grade in the [C+, B+] range was great and that A-'s and A's should be viewed as winning the lottery. I guess that's true, maybe, but after a lifetime of succeeding academically and getting mostly A's, how can you just snap your fingers and say ""oh yeah a C+ is a great grade!"" Maybe for some classes/circumstances, it is, but I personally would never consider it *amazing.* Goodbye med school, lol.

Maybe Madison's parents said something similar to her (?) and maybe she was experiencing the same thing as I am--trying to accept a new reality in terms of academics, life, and what constitutes success (?) but finding it hard to accept. 

Anyway--back to the original question--what should she have done in order to live a (happier?) life at Penn? Or really for any students at any competitive university. Accept the (now) lower grades they earn? Do their best to improve academically (office hours, tutoring, studying better) and ultimately accept their limitations?

>Psychedelic experiences are known to be some of the most profoundly moving of one’s life, and researchers are finding early success with psychedelic-assisted therapy for the treatment of depression, addiction, and PTSD. Outside of a clinical setting--with peer groups, underground therapists, or in ceremonial settings--these experiences can range from intensely terrifying to profoundly positive. Yet, the average therapist has little training on how to help patients reduce the potential for harm and weave these experiences into the course of therapy, enhancing the potential for a beneficial outcome. In this talk, we present a way of shifting the paradigm in psychotherapy to include psychedelic experiences as potentially valuable in the quest for healing.

squeeze_tooth_paste,"Hello! I'm a newly admitted ED student, but I'm heavily disappointed at the lack of financial aid that I expected. 

I relied on my FAFSA EFC of approximately a $1000 and the Upenn Net Price Calculator of around $10,000 to ""demonstrate my need"" that Upenn promises to meet for every student. 

And right now I'm sitting on a 79K estimated total cost of attendance, and I think it just does not make any sense that I have to pay 8 times my NPC and 80 times my EFC? In which case I will not be able to attend obviously. 

Their website says that even people above 200K+ income receives financial aid, so I believe there must be a mistake. I submitted a few forms late, right after 11/4, but I have confirmation emails about them. I wanted to check whether they had any missing documents before considering my aid, but the only thing that the financial aid office could do was tell me to appeal, which I certainly am. 

If anyone has any idea what could have possibly happened, or if there's a way I can get more information on how my evaluation went down, that would be much appreciated. I heard appealing takes months, so I hope to be able to take action or at least get some information from their office soon—I'm just unsure how...

Laurelinthegold,"Revision to Fall Semester Plans
Regarding On-Campus Housing, Tuition and Fees

A Message to the Penn Community
from
Amy Gutmann, President
Wendell Pritchett, Provost
Craig Carnaroli, Executive Vice President
J. Larry Jameson, Dean, Perelman School of Medicine and
Executive VP University of Pennsylvania for the Health System

We write today with an enormous sense of sadness. It had been our fervent hope since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic that public health measures and an increased availability of testing would allow us to offer our undergraduates a hybrid learning experience this fall that, by including more remote learning, social distancing and other safety precautions, would enable all the students who desired it the opportunity to live and learn on campus.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 continues to spread at an alarming rate across the country, with approximately 2 million new cases reported over just the past month. The progression of the disease is evident in many states from which Penn welcomes thousands of students. The sheer number of students who by Pennsylvania public health recommendation would now upon arrival—or based upon testing or high-risk exposure—need to go into a two-week quarantine is untenable. At the same time, supply chain issues have more severely limited the availability and the turn-around time of COVID testing than medical experts foresaw. Since we last communicated we learned that our planned pre-testing regimen would not be possible. The combination of these factors radically constrains our ability to provide a safe and meaningful on-campus experience for our undergraduates.

Thus, based on the advice of the leading health experts at Penn Medicine and on current public health restrictions, with the full support of the Penn Board of Trustees, we must share the deeply disappointing news that with only very limited exceptions for international students and those students dealing with significant housing or personal hardships, we will not be able to accommodate undergraduate students in University housing. Students who need to apply for on-campus housing exceptions can do so at My Home at Penn.

As we have previously announced, the vast majority of instruction for undergraduate students will be online, with very limited exceptions (clinical experiences in Nursing, and classes in other undergraduate schools that are essential for students to meet their curricular or pedagogical requirements). Graduate and professional programs will continue to evaluate their own operations.

It is important to note that with the limited exception of this required in-person instruction, there will be no physical on-campus activities in the fall semester. For the safety of students and the broader community, we are encouraging all other students not to return to Philadelphia.

Our world-class faculty are preparing an outstanding array of engaging online courses, ensuring that the University continues to provide a meaningful and high-quality education to all our students. Faculty have been busy this summer designing new recordings, interactive elements for their students and working with their schools in state-of-the-art classroom studios. In addition, University Life and the Office of Student Affairs, the Center for Undergraduate Research, and College Houses have designed new ways for student groups and cohorts to connect online, to hold virtual performances, to present and attend academic poster sessions and fairs and to gather virtually. Some of these have already begun, with the largest ever Pre-Freshman Program currently underway. Every incoming undergraduate will participate in the launch of our online New Student Orientation, which will include year-long cohort activities this year around the theme of Civic Engagement. New Student Orientation will culminate in a virtual Convocation on August 31st.

While we have great confidence in the high quality of this educational and college life experience, we deeply regret that these changes represent a significant disappointment to families and students. We have stressed in all of our previous messages that our decisions for the fall would be guided by the most current medical information and governmental directives, and that our plans would need to be flexible and could change depending on the progression of the pandemic. For everyone’s safety, it is imperative to take the steps we are announcing today.

Despite the escalating costs of providing a safe and meaningful educational program, we recognize and appreciate the financial challenges incurred by many students in our community as a result of the pandemic. As a result, we have determined to make tuition and fee adjustments for the fall semester. Tuition for the fall semester will be rolled back by 3.9%, thus freezing tuition at last year’s rate, and the General Fee will be reduced for the fall semester by 10%. Housing and dining fees that have been paid by students will be credited or refunded in full, consistent with the methodology used in the Spring. Student financial aid budgets for tuition and general fees will remain at current levels, despite the decrease in cost to students, and students remaining at home will still receive aid for food commensurate with our off-campus dining rate. The University has made significant increases in our financial aid budget to assist students and families in this difficult time and we will continue to make emergency assistance available to support all students who need it.

Since March, when we made the difficult but necessary decision to depopulate the campus, faculty and staff from across the University have worked tirelessly to prepare our campus to welcome students this fall. We continue to hope that we will be able to welcome students back for the spring semester, and will do everything in our power to maximize that possibility.

All of us at Penn are deeply grateful for the patience that families and students have shown as we have navigated the rapidly changing landscape of this evolving global crisis. We sincerely believe that the educational experience that students will receive this fall will be among the finest available in the world. We will do all that we can to keep each class involved and connected virtually, so that they can continue to interact and share their Penn experience with classmates in a safe and productive way.

We know that there will be many questions that arise because of the changes we are announcing today. We have prepared an FAQ that should be helpful in providing more detailed information. If you have questions that are not answered in the FAQ, you can email coronavirus@upenn.edu. 

We thank you for your ongoing understanding and support of the University of Pennsylvania. This has been an extraordinarily challenging year, which has solidified so clearly the invaluable spirit and solidarity of our Penn family. Please know that the University is committed to your safety and well-being, and to providing a truly world-class educational experience.

Undergraduate courses for the Fall semester are being offered online, with a few, limited, in person offerings. For undergraduates in the Nursing School, the only in-person course work will be clinical simulations, experiences in the hospital, and clinical settings. For students in the other three undergraduate schools, a minimal number of courses will be offered in-person where it is essential to have an in-person experience in order to meet curricular and/or pedagogical requirements. Penn first-year international students can get a support letter from their academic school/department to confirm that they are attending a hybrid program in Fall 2020. If an in-person course is offered, accommodations will be provided for those studying remotely. Instructors may elect to come to campus for in-person office hours or to meet in person with students from time to time.

WHOAHOAAHOAHS,"It seems like many other colleges, Oregon, Berkeley, UT Austin, Penn State, Harvard (possibly) etc... are implementing plans for a low to mid density campus. For the most part these schools are either eliminating triples and above and only allowing for singles and doubles or just prohibiting certain groups of people from coming back to campus (high risk, those that don't necessarily need to use on campus facilities such as those not in labs or doing stuff like performing arts or architecture, and unintentionally international students due to travel bans & visa complications) + encouraging people to not come back if they dont want to. It seems very likely that Penn will take similar action for very obvious reasons. In one of these scenarios, mainly the former, what exactly will people be doing for housing as people living in triples and quads will be forced to break housing contracts and find housing elsewhere? Will people be forced to try to find off campus housing? Would it encourage more people to just do school remotely from home.

Like many of you, I am debating whether to take a gap year considering the strong probability that we won’t have a normal freshman experience and the fact that even with FinAid I don’t think it’s worth the money.

However, my family argues that it would be risky to not enter freshman year out of fear that international students not currently taking classes may get their financial aid revoked, or our acceptances cancelled. Of course I am very doubtful something like that can happen but ultimately its my parents’ money.

Do any of you know of any documents that ensure admitted students keep their finaid or acceptances in times like this, which I can use to prove to them taking a Gap Year isn’t risky?

zandm7,"So I've posted about this previously, but to make a long story short I've started a Rocket League club at Penn and also have formed a Rocket League eSports team here (we will be competing in the collegiate summer league). We are always looking for more members, so if you play Rocket League (or know anyone who does) and go to Penn, please check us out!

Moreover, the eSports team is looking for more members; we need as many people as possible so that we have substitutes and can field the best possible lineup in our summer league games! Currently two of our starters are Class of 2017 seniors, so they will be eligible for summer league play but there is no guarantee they will be eligible for any tournaments beginning in Fall 2017 and later, so we need some of the younger students to step up and fill their shoes when they're gone!

Seriously, the eSports team needs as many members as we can get. Don't be shy, even if you think you might not be good enough or whatever. With college students' schedules we need lots of players to choose from just to ensure that we can field a full 3-player roster for every match :)

If you're at all interested in the club and/or joining the eSports team, please check us out on Facebook and Discord (links below)!

crownsyrup,"If people decide to stay home for the fall semester, they are not guaranteed housing for the spring. Their aid packages also reflect the reduced cost of living with family ($0 for housing). HOWEVER - financial aid packages are for the entire academic year. So let's say that hypothetically, things get better by spring and they want to come back. Not only are they not guaranteed housing, but their aid packages wouldn't have included funds to rent off-campus since they got $0 for living with family for the whole year. That may make some people unable to afford coming back to campus. They would want/need to continue staying home. But what if things get better to the point that there is no option for an online spring semester?  What if all classes are back to being in-person? Would these people have no option but to pay what they are unable to afford without any aid?

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view peoples' availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of Yale students to the platform and it has been working great so far.

octavv1a,"Hi All, I am a relative newcomer to the area. I am a recent graduate (not of Penn) working as a scientific programmer at Penn since earlier in the year. It seemed that interest in FOSS / side projects / gaming was rare in my work group, so I thought about trying to start a group on campus, as I have been made aware that staff members may start groups freely without registration, and can reserve rooms.

My initial idea was to create a type of coworking environment where folks interested in programming projects can hang out and get work done, or discuss interesting problems, and also take a break with some games in order to break up the monotony. I was considering a weekly or bi-weekly event in the evening (6pm-?pm). However, if culture is such that there is not much interest in something like this, I would not bother proceeding with the official registration.

Let me know if you have any questions or are interested in general! I am welcome to any feedback or ideas.

\*Edit\* strawpoll to vote on day of week: [http://www.strawpoll.me/18488995](http://www.strawpoll.me/18488995)

\*Edit\* Tentatively planning to make the first meet up on the week of September 9th after class schedule changes end. As Tuesday is the winning day on the poll currently, if I can get a reasonable room then, the first meet should be on the night of September 10th. I will keep this thread updated as I get more information.

\*Edit Aug-28\* I have recently been in contact with the code@nite organizers who have arrived back from break. They are soon going to provide the date of the first  code@nite event where I think it would be good for all of us to meet and decide if and where we should schedule supplementary events in addition to their's. I will let you all know the place and time as soon as I have it.

\*Edit Nov-2\* Wow, it seems I generally got shafted by the code@nite organizers. They said they would reach out when creating an event, and did not. By chance I randomly was looking for info and saw that they were hosting the first event \*the next day\*. It was in Harnwell House. When I arrived the my staff ID did not allow me access, as it is seemingly limited to only students who live there.

TheMercurialMaverick,"I’ve been trying to decide between Penn and JHU for a while now, and visiting both hasn’t eased my stress. I applied to both as a biophysics major with intention to go premed, but a variety of things has caused me to worry.

One: Biophysics isn’t exactly what I thought it was. Honestly, when I was applying I was like “Well I like bio and I like physics so why not?” I think I’d be more interested in something like just physics, neuroscience, or engineering.

Two: The more I learn about premed/med school, the less I want to do it. It sounds extremely stressful and rigorous for no reason with my level of interest in the field. But, what kind of job can a degree in neuroscience get without going premed?

Three: I was admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences. If I wanted to do some type of engineering, how much would it take for me to transfer into SEAS. Would it set me back? How is the BS in engineering different from the BA that the College offers? I know that I can’t transfer until I have spent a year in the College, so would I preemptively change to the College’s engineering program?

AanyaBuk,"Here is a proposal I want to send to whomever is in charge of Wharton curriculum.

Please give me some constructive feedback on why you think this idea is bad or great. If this post is too long for you, don't comment. 

All Wharton fundamentals course lectures should be online with recitation sections where the professor/TA reviews homework in an interactive format with students (e.g. TA grades students' homework, and students put the homework solutions on the whiteboards and answer each others' questions). Tests should still be done in person, as there are many methods of getting around online tests.

&#x200B;

This is for a few reasons:

First, often times, students do not want to attend lectures for the Wharton fundamentals courses. They are often filled with \~40-100 students and don't allow for much engagement.

Second, typically, these are massive lecture classes. Replacing the massive lectures online would clear up space in the university to hold other events/lectures by notable speakers. If they are not massive lectures, they often are classes that are back-to-back in one room.

Third, these foundational courses don't change year to year. I have talked to alumni from 20 years back and spoken about the same course material. Because of this, there are high fixed costs and low variable costs. Once the course is developed, the course does not have to change or update its material.

Fourth, the classes take up professors' time, which would be better spent doing research or teaching more advanced classes.

Fifth, they take up a good portion of Wharton students' schedules. By allowing for online courses, they would allow for greater flexibility for Wharton students to take electives within the first few semesters of students' schedules at Penn. This would help students learn a more diverse array of knowledge.

&#x200B;

There are a few risks.

Mainly, these are the first courses that Wharton students are introduced to at Penn, so if the courses are poorly executed online, then that could have a negative effect on Wharton's brand. Thus, ensuring that the recitation sections are well-developed and engaging is key.

Second, these classes may want to incorporate new companies or important new events. For example, FNCE101 (Macroeconomics) will often incorporate current macro events, and MGMT101 will often incorporate interesting case studies (Amazon). This means that some lectures will have to be adjusted (perhaps every 5 years) as new companies emerge. The current events piece can be addressed by adding seminar components to the recitation courses.

&#x200B;

To minimize risk, this program can be rolled out to several classes based on professor consent. Metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of this program are test grades and Penn Course Review feedback.

If execution is good, test grades do not drop (or increase), and Penn Course Review feedback is positive, this program could be rolled out to the other Wharton fundamentals courses at Penn.",Proposal: Wharton Fundamentals Online with In-person Recitation?,11,0.79,fuh8rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/fuh8rz/proposal_wharton_fundamentals_online_with/,4,1585979249.0,2020-04-04 00:47:29

It doesn’t matter if you are a freshman free to party til it’s late
Or a senior itching to graduate 
We have all been here long enough to know that this place has issues
But too many of us have been putting our smarts to misuse
We like to hint at our concerns on our meme page
But there has not been a lot of real change
So I ask you this— what are the troubles that you can find?
They can be prevalent or exist just in your mind
Of course we have a long road ahead of us if we want to solve them
But the first step to recovery is admitting there is a problem

The staff at the Penn Computer Connection is always looking for ways to serve you better.  To further this goal, we are hoping to get some feedback about your perceptions of shopping with our store.  We go to great efforts to make sure you know we're right down the street and ready to help, but often hear from graduating students that they weren't aware of us until far too late in their academic career.

A couple of notes about who we are, in case you aren't sure:

• The Penn Computer Connection is a University of Pennsylvania department established to help fulfill the computing needs of members of the Penn community.  We are staffed by University employees and work in concert with the computing departments of the various schools and centers to make sure that the products we offer are appropriate for home and campus use.

• We're located next to the Penn Bookstore on the main floor, between Urban Outfitters and Pod.  Our store looks more or less like [this](http://i.imgur.com/4OjdV.jpg).

If you have any experiences you'd like to share, any ideas of products or categories you'd like to have available conveniently on campus, or even if you don't have any idea of who we are or what we do, please feel free to comment and let us know.  All suggestions are welcome and appreciated!

Thanks for helping us to help you better.

Realistic-Storm,"I saw a lot of people asking about financial aid and the questions regarding the bills that have been posted and thought it'd be great to have a centered post for this kind of stuff. 

So far, you should see your package on Penn in Touch and certain charges (and grants or scholarships) if you have them on PennPay. Right now, I don't believe any dining costs as well as health insurance costs have been added and in some cases housing costs.  These will be reflected in updates usually throughout the month and into early August (you will normally get an email notification whenever something changes on PennPay).

If you have a negative balance at the end of all the costs and grants and such, that money will in turn become a refund for you (through direct deposit you'll receive it in your bank account). This normally happens if you're highly aided or receiving financial aid to cover housing and dining on campus, but you have no dining plan or are living off-campus.

tondolliver31,"Hi guys, I'm an incoming freshman in SEAS. I apologize in advance if this question has been asked before. I see a lot of people saying they want to double major in, let's say, BME and Econ, or CIS and Econ, or CBE and Visual arts.

Looking at the engineering major curricula, how is this possible in a 4 year schedule? Each engineering major is at least 37 credits, and each CAS major is at least 12 (I think?). Plus, wouldn't engineering students pursuing this track need to complete the general CAS requirements as well? This seems like far too much to fit in 40-48 credits. Any insight on this?
