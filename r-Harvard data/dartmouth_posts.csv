if you didn‚Äôt already know, dartmouth essentially gave international students two weeks to ‚Äúgo back‚Äù home. this is obviously problematic because 

1. lots of flights are restricted because of corona 
2. some international students can‚Äôt afford a flight back home

Zeta-X,"Am I the only one who thinks Dartmouth's coronavirus response was absolutely horrific? 

Timeline:

- Announces that students have 4 days to leave dorms, and will not be able to stay 
- The day after students have to vacate (and tuition is due), announces that students will not be returning
- Prohibits students, even those still in Hanover, from retrieving their belongings for any reason
- Has yet to refund anyone for spring term, and provided zero assistance for students with nowhere to go or money to get there

The fact that they announced that students wouldn't be returning the literal day after evicting everyone makes it incredibly clear that the decision was ready, and they just didn't want students to panic (or to not pay spring tuition). 

Sitting here as a '20, I'll have to cross the country and return to Hanover after June to retrieve my belongings: which I could've taken with me and simply moved on had Dartmouth announced their decision when they made it. 

Unlike almost all of its peer institutions, including Yale and Harvard specifically), Dartmouth has failed to keep dorms open for students who rely on them for housing, and has opted instead to throw hundreds of poor students onto couches, shelters, and the streets with 4 days notice. Their reasoning? To ""fight the spread of coronavirus"": by sending students traveling around the globe after an outbreak instead of isolating on campus. Dartmouth screwed over its students because it wanted to dodge culpability, and its response literally worsened the crisis. 

Absolutely horrible crisis response by Dartmouth on all levels.

Bendragonpants,"TL;DR on Friday there was an incident near the college that prompted a shelter-in-place.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard:

-around 9:50 on Friday, a person took a shot near the Christian Science Reading room (near Sigma Delta), grazing a non-Dartmouth student 

-There were reports of unconfirmed shots at collis, and around tuck drive, but these were false. These reports nonetheless prompted extensive police response from the area

-One ‚Äúnon-Dartmouth student‚Äù was grazed, but was taken to the hospital and is ok. I‚Äôve been told he was a student from Providence college up to visit a friend 

-Police arrested two suspects around 11:30 in Lebanon after a short car chase. They were driving a black Ford Fusion, which they crashed at the end of the chase. Both male, one was 17 years old, and the other was 22 years old. Unclear if they were connected to the events on campus 

-the shelter in place lasted around two hours

\-I was also admitted to UT Plan II Honors, which is about 50k/year less than Dartmouth. For pre-med, is Dartmouth worth it money-wise? What would I be paying for? Would I be better off saving for medical school? 

\-How has Dartmouth helped you with medical school admissions? At my state school, I'd be in a program of 176 kids, so I would get the small community feeling at a fraction of the price. 

\-How hard is it to get an A in Dartmouth pre-med classes? Ik that the program is notorious for weeding out pre-meds, and as of right now, I know that I want to attend medical school for sure.

tasukete_onegai,"Hey all,

As a typical college student, I love free things and love discovering free things that Dartmouth offers to students. I'm currently trying to compile a list of these free resources for current and future students (congrats '24s!) so it will be easier to find, since a lot of these resources can be kind of niche to find or scattered around the various Dartmouth sites. Making this list kinda helps justify the tuition since the college literally has some many licenses to stuff and I've discovered some cool places on campus in the process.

So far I've gotten all the news subscriptions, free access to Lynda/LinkedIn Learning courses, Safer Sex Bar at Robo, BorrowDirect (which I personally think is one of the most underrated resources out there),  Bloomberg certification training, Teatime at Sanborn and a few other random ones. This obviously is pretty sparse compared to what's out there, I'm sure, and I'm curious to hear what other people have found useful during their time here.

My big goal is to make a full functioning site that promotes these resources along with the free things that students offer, like the Mental Health Student Union's ""Late Night Solace"" or events that have free-food.

A few hours back, I was admitted to the Dartmouth Class of 2023! WOHOOO!!! Although I'm still recovering from the shock, I wanted to post this before going to bed (it's actually early morning in my timezone).

Anyway, one of the reasons I love Dartmouth is because everybody always says that it's really incredible at undergraduate teaching. Apparently, the quality of the teachers is really beyond anything else at other schools, and that's why so many people pick it (among other reasons, obviously). This can also be seen since it's ranked number 2 in the USNWR list of ""Best Colleges for Undergraduate Teaching"".

Now, I know that sometimes rankings don't mean much, so I figured I'd come straight to the source. Is undergraduate teaching at Dartmouth really great? Obviously, this depends on the individual class/professor, but did how did you find it to be overall? Any especially positive/negative experiences?

Thanks!

dartmouth24,"Hello! I am an incoming ‚Äò24, and I think I‚Äôm getting some pre-college nerves, so I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some reassurance that I made the right decision to attend Dartmouth. 

When I visited Dartmouth, I absolutely loved it. It was definitely one of my favorite visits, and I loved the middle ground it struck between a liberal arts college and university, and the strong sense of community. I strongly considered applying ED, but I ended up applying RD instead, and I fortunately was accepted. 

Now, I‚Äôm a little worried I made a mistake. I have always been concerned about the prevalence of Greek Life as a non-drinker, and I generally don‚Äôt enjoy parties very much. Allegations of sexual assault against one member of the class of 2024 especially worries me. I always thought that the reputation for misogyny on Dartmouth‚Äôs campus was exaggerated relative to peer schools, but this does not inspire confidence. Can I still have a fulfilling social life if I don‚Äôt participate in Greek Life or the party scene, and can any women speak to their experiences with misogyny on campus?

I originally loved the laid-back, non-competitive atmosphere of Dartmouth, but now I‚Äôm concerned that I would have been better served at a school with a more intellectual environment, even if it does foster more competition between students. I know the students at Dartmouth are intelligent and I love that Dartmouth students are modest and lack the pretentiousness present at many other top schools. Would you say that Dartmouth still has an intellectual atmosphere, if someone wants it?

Dartmouth‚Äôs plan for reopening also seems very restrictive, and I understand that it is only meant to maintain the health of its students, but it is also frustrating that the administration is not using this as an opportunity to address the housing shortage on campus.  I‚Äôm very concerned that this will significantly inhibit my ability to make friends and find the community that I wanted from Dartmouth, and it seems that the administration has also gone back on their promise to allow freshmen to defer their enrollment after the deadline. Freshman year seems pivotal for finding your place at Dartmouth, and I would be lying if I said I haven‚Äôt considered just taking a gap year and rolling the dice again with next year‚Äôs admissions process. 

I know it‚Äôs very difficult to assess from such little information, but given my concerns, do you think Dartmouth is still a place I would love?

,"Diversity has been thrown around as a buzzword by administration. ‚ÄúWe want our campus to be diverse‚Äù so they recruit students from different backgrounds. 

Coming up with recruitment strategies is easy. Let‚Äôs say you get the diverse crowd you want here to hanover. How do you keep them engaged?!?

I‚Äôm so sick and tired of this bullshit. Hanover is a dump of a town, businesses close with nothing opening. If you claim to be diverse or want diversity as a college you should make sure that you keep the town diverse too I.e not closing diverse businesses like Jewel of India. I agree Jewels food is mediocre at best but hey it‚Äôs an affordable option that supplied the college with some form of diverse culture. 

Second thing that pisses me off the most is the fact that there isn‚Äôt anything to do here. Disclaimer I‚Äôm a graduate student so my life is a little different but I shouldn‚Äôt have to beg for a decent place with a dj that throws on some hip hop and dance music. If you want to retain a diverse crowd the add some diversity to campus. Frats blow. No one cares about your college band and their shitty music.

not_palindrome,"Frosh here - I've been talking with a couple other freshman and we've all been voicing the same opinion:

**Many of Dartmouth's clubs are poorly run** with flaky leadership exacerbated by a vertical power structure, leaving enthusiastic new members with little capacity to enact change. Not to name clubs, but these organizations that seemed VERY legit/big when applying/interviewing for aren't actually doing much, with people in charge canceling many meetings.

I was really bummed as I slowly discovered this the past fall term. And confused!! My impression going into Dartmouth was that the school admits people passionate about academics and clubs! This doesn't really seem to be the case?

Now I've only been here for a term, but it **seems like Dartmouth's party and Greek culture has a part to play in the lack of club participation**. I've seen committee directors cancel meetings during homecoming week and other big events during term, which has led me to conclude that **the priorities of the students here are academics/parties, THEN extracurriculars**. Is this the case?

Anyway, this combined with

1. the HUGE **emphasis on finance** by the institution itself (career center is super unhelpful for non econ/fin jobs, whether this is true or not its reputation garnered turns off students from seeking their aid). Dartmouth attracted me because I thought people were doing what they **loved**. **But there's a huge amount of the population** that  openly acknowledges wanting to make money over pursuing their passions or trying to help others. This sense of complacency stuns me.
2. the **lack of students and outside resources** (bc it's more rural) for niche clubs. Dartmouth does acapella, dance, sports very well. There is no space on campus to wander in and make art without taking a class. Also means good speakers aren't willing to make the drive to Hanover; the talks I've been to this term (at least 10) have been underwhelming.
3. the culture of wanting to **fit in and fit a certain mold** (ex. people always commenting on how they *love* person X, or the immediate question on every freshman's mind-if they will rush); my hypothesis is this stems from the dominance of Greek culture, with freshman/sophomore girls feeling they need to social climb and get into certain houses, and freshman guys needing to suck up to upperclassmen
4. and **lack of developed sexual assault programs by the college** (I don't have complete experience on this, but was looking to join SAPA but realized their members don't end up helping many ppl per term?? Each member helps on average 1 student/quarter. And there's a huge focus on victim and bystander action but not curbing perpetrators? And why does Dartmouth not release *percentage* of student body receiving non consensual touching versus the number of students? Plus their statistics are not easily found... are they still participating in Association of American Universities' survey?)
5. there is **one dining hall** on campus. The lack of food options leads to the huge line at KAF, which would not play out anywhere else (The Dartmouth has even written a piece on the psychological change students undergo at Dartmouth). This relates to #2 - the lack of outside resources in the form of restaurants. It's not the lack of food but more how it changes the student body's, giving a scarcity mentality.

It seems like the **DOC is a great alternative space** instead of Greek life community and partying. But that **leaves a gap** for people who aren't that into the outdoors and still want this community, which is usually fulfilled by clubs... Collis Nightlife does an okay job, so do LLCs, but these seem to be exceptions to the overall party culture.

There's a lot of **jaded upperclassmen** that seem to confirm some of these aspects of Dartmouth. I'm honestly super bummed after my first term. **UGAs don't seem to actually care** about student adjustment and instead take on the job for the $ (one has openly said it; I've seen the actions of another), leaving me to voice my concerns with other freshman.

I am aware there are two options here. Either I can see this as an opportunity for me to contribute back to the campus by becoming a great UGA, advocating for niche clubs, not participating in Greek life, avoiding people whose prioritization of partying/social climbing that does not align with my own. But goddammit, isn't college a time for me to learn and grow without inhibitions? **I will need to be so intentional about going against the grain, going against Dartmouth's culture.** And on top of balancing schoolwork, etc... it might be a lot to handle in the future.

I do acknowledge I compare what Dartmouth's sexual assault and club opportunities with Stanford's, the university I am most familiar with, and these institutions are not on the same caliber. I'm seriously considering transferring to another university (not Stanford) but don't know if my concerns will dissipate and my impression is that transferring puts you at a significant disadvantage in your new school (having 1 less year).

throwaway49580948,"Hey there!

I'm a '22 guy and I didn't rush this fall. I thought I would for a long time but was never sure, the one house I liked the most didn't really want me, and so I decided it wasn't for me. It' been a bit up and down but mostly I feel ok about being unaffiliated. The vast majority of my friends are affiliated and I hang out at their houses a lot, so I'm not in the non-greek social spaces really, and I like the system. So i'm in a bit of a weird place.

I just wanted to ask people who have been through more of Dartmouth than I have about their perspective on being unaffiliated or on their friends who are. Specifically, about a couple of things:

\- In terms of social life, is it going to be a big drawback? Esp. as a guy? Or are things pretty inclusive, esp. during sophomore summer and as a junior/senior? So far it's a mix of inclusivity and exclusivity but it was also pledge term so I'm kind of unsure of where things stand going forward.

\- Is it going to make it hard for me to date/be attractive to girls? I know everyone loves formals and i.. can't offer that. But I have a lot of female friends in sororities and I wonder if ppl. have noticed a stigma around dating unaffiliated or if it's really irrelevant

\- In terms of networking, is a frat like a ""helpful plus"" or absolutely necessary for competitive job searching? On one hand it feels kind of irrelevant bc ppl at peer schools with nothing like greek life make it work. But also I think I might be interested in consulting and I feel like everyone going into finance/consulting has some in through their house

jsun2153,"I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of student orgs and communities use [when2meet.com](https://when2meet.com/) to schedule board meetings and campus events. However after using the app myself, I found that the frontend design is very unattractive and makes it really hard to schedule/enter availabilities on mobile.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people‚Äôs availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of Yale students to the platform and it has been working great so far. I thought that the Dartmouth community might find this web app useful as well.

Savings-Shock,"Hey there! I just got in for the class of 24 and am looking very heavily to committing there very soon (after weighing a few other ivy options). I did have a few questions tho (its a lot, but any help to any questions would be immensely appreciated):

1. For housing, is there any objectively better house for freshman (such as clearly better food, dorms/dorm-type ratio, size, etc), and is there any way to apply specifically to that house (Such as by filling out the survey in a specific way). Also, what percent of freshman get single room dorms and is there any way to increase the chances of obtaining a single room dorm?
2. Do you think that not having a huge summer break is well (is not more compensated) by having the D-plan and other (but more) smaller breaks? I kinda look at this positively because i‚Äôd get bored as hell if i had to stay home for 3 months in the summer, but maybe the scheduling could conflict with personal time to do research/other things. What are your opinions?
3. For math and/or pre-med, what have you guys done in the local area in regard to research, shadowing, volunteering, etc? Have any of you guys done the early assurance program/are working toward applying there?
4. In regard to greek life, im REALLY unaware. Im more or less introverted, and am not sure if it would be a great fit for me, but the location, size, relationships with profs and the overall better UG experience at dartmouth makes me lean toward them over other ivies. Does anyone have any good info that can clarify what greek life is at dartmouth and how someone more introverted could still be a part of the culture (though not drinking or partying or whatever)?
5. What would you guys say is the average class size for classes in STEM as as a whole? I‚Äòve seen a lot of numbers as ‚Äúaverages‚Äú but not for specific fields.
6. Lastly, i know winter sucks, but any tips to get through it? What kinds of clothes should i get (live on the sunny west coast lol, so honestly dont know). Anything else to prepare for? Anything to take advantage of?

Dreyeris,"Hello; yep, another prospective student here.

Could anyone tell me anything about the music opportunities at Dartmouth beyond the actual major/minor? I'm not interested in pursuing music academically per se, but I would very much like to be able to have places to go to be able to practice on guitar and to continue to teach myself drums and piano (and I obviously can't just fit a drumset or a full piano in my dorm room)... So yeah, what kind of opportunities for that are there at Dartmouth? Also, are instrument lesson programs available for non-music majors?

dado3212,"Dear fellow members of the Dartmouth community,

By now, many of you may have seen the video clip of OU's SAE chapter. In it, students make disgusting, racially charged slurs in a song.

What happened there is sickening. It goes against everything that we, as a house ‚Äì and as members of the Dartmouth community ‚Äì stand for. Racism is unacceptable and disgraceful. But as this incident has shown us, it is still alive and well in this country. The people in OU's chapter are not our brothers, and we are appalled that the letters ‚ÄúSAE‚Äù are attached to this incident. However, we will not simply look the other way ‚Äì we are determined to take this opportunity to highlight the bigoted, problematic mentalities that exist around us today.

On Wednesday, March 11th, at 7PM, we will host a student-led discussion to speak about the incident and, more broadly, discuss racial issues at Dartmouth (particularly as it pertains to the Greek system). Dinner will be served. Our panel of guest-speakers will include members from all walks of the Dartmouth community. Our hope is that, in speaking candidly about our different experiences at Dartmouth, we can achieve a greater mutual understanding, and in doing so take a step towards being the truly diverse, inclusive, and progressive institution that we aspire to be.

I got into Dartmouth and Brown and am having a lot of trouble deciding between the two. I'm leaning towards Brown but I really loved Dartmouth when I visited. I was hoping that you guys could give me some more insight into your experience at Dartmouth so that I can make the most informed decision.

Things to note about me:

* Asian-American male
* Went to private boarding school
* I applied as an envi-sci major but am mostly undecided, probably stem tho
* The arts scene is very important to me

Questions:

* By the numbers, Dartmouth's diversity is similar to other colleges, but I've heard that Dartmouth is very ""waspy"" and more homogeneous in terms of the culture. Is this true? How much does that affect a minority's experience at Dartmouth? Is there a strong Asian community?
* I'm not a huge fan of Greek life, but I really have no idea what they're like. Plz fill me in - do they run the campus social life, drinking, hazing, etc? What do people who aren't in frats do to socialize, and are they left out at all?
* How much freedom do you have to explore your interests?
* Do you ever feel isolated? Pros and cons of the location?
* Pros and cons of the D-plan?
* How are the arts at Dartmouth (especially visual arts)?

Thanks!

curiousukulele,"Hi! I‚Äôm an UCI research assistant and I was assigned the task of understanding how major selection works in a few top colleges, one of which includes Dartmouth. I was wondering if you guys could help me out with a few of your opinions; it definitely doesn‚Äôt have to be objective, I‚Äôm grateful for all the information, however subjective, I can collect. I've already perused the website and statements by admission officers, but I wanted to hear from actual students, so educated guesses (or even speculation) are all appreciated!

So, here are the questions:

1. Does Dartmouth require you to input an intended major on your application? Can you put undeclared?
2. If Dartmouth does require an intended major, after you‚Äôre accepted to Dartmouth with that intended major, does Dartmouth expect you to follow through? For instance, if a student picked ‚ÄúComputer Science,‚Äù will Dartmouth funnel that student into an engineering department and expect him/her to take engineering courses and activities, or does Dartmouth really treat everyone the same way no matter what they picked for intended major (at least until they declare)? Is there a limiting of options in regards to classes, activities, etc. for certain majors, even unintentionally?
3. When does Dartmouth expect students to declare their majors by? Can a student be truly ‚ÄúUndeclared‚Äù up until the point of declaring their majors?
4. And lastly, based on your opinion, does intended major affect admissions? A lot of colleges I‚Äôve looked into have stated publicly that the intended major does not affect admissions, but we also know diversity in ideologies (and thus major) is also important. This, of course, is a very touchy subject and I‚Äôm definitely not expecting the absolute, objective truth for this question; just wanted to hear your thoughts. 

Other than these questions, if you have any other comments you could share about how students are pressured to take certain majors over others at Dartmouth, and any reason they would change their major: they would be appreciated!

GammaHuman,"Howdy!
 
I‚Äôm a moderator of /r/ApplyingToCollege. We‚Äôre a community that is dedicated to assisting high school students through the process of applying to colleges. We do this through a combination of the help from high school students, college students, and university admissions officers, as well as a few private consultants and university faculty.
 
I‚Äôm currently working on a project to expand our wiki and give the users of the subreddit a better idea of student life and academics at different schools and I would love to hear your take on student life at Dartmouth.
 
This is the first time our subreddit is working on getting profiles of a school in this manner; we‚Äôve previously had posts on the subreddit, many of these were in pro/con format, but that is not required. Feel free to write in whatever way best suits you.
 
Here are some Pro/Con ones if you‚Äôd like to see previous examples: [UCLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6339ds/ucla_pros_and_cons/) [Berkeley](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63avr2/uc_berkeley_pros_and_cons/)
 
But a response like [this (You're School! / Dartmouth)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/62z66y/my_dartmouth_experience/) or [this (Duke)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/62qeyy/reasons_why_you_may_dislike_duke_a_memoir_from_an/) is also acceptable.
 
#For some ideas on topics to cover:
 
**Academic:** Quality of education, Academic Rigor, Research opportunities, Special programs (honors programs, Living learning communities, ect.), Grad School placement, Campus visiting Speakers, Collaborative VS. Competitive, Major Flexibility, class sizes, lecture VS. discussion, academic quality of peers, grade inflation/deflation, Student body size (help or hurt?), how large does the school feel?, grading, academic stress, study abroad opportunities, average career success of graduates,
 
**University Facilities:** Career Services (Student and Grad), Job Recruitment, General Campus Events, Bias of funding to certain majors, Mental health services, Advising Quality, Access to Financial Aid, 
 
**Student Life:** Typical Student (if existent), Student government, Major Traditions, Racial and Economic Diversity, clubs, organizations, school spirit, athletics (varsity, intramural, club), Social Hierarchy (if any), greek life, city life, party / club scene, other general thoughts on student life,


**Room & Board:** Dorm Life (including specific dorm‚Äôs culture), Dorm quality, On campus dining, Off campus dining, Campus internet,

Anyways, I am in Florida for College now and plan on doing this Vermont trip the first week of January next season, like January 6-10 2021. I just have a few questions.

1. What is the best resort as far as cliff lines, glades, expert runs, etc.?
2. What is the cheapest resort as far as tickets and lodging?
3. Is it easier to stay at the mountain or just stay in Burlington and uber to the slopes?
4. Best resort for terrain parks?
5. Best resort with good food and a nice culture/vibe?

I've been trying to find tech internships to get out (just got rejected from one actually) and have talked to my dean about the petition form, which then resulted in a visit to Dick's House because I have a strong feeling that my current D Plan of being on for 5 consecutive terms will just lead me into a mental spiral like in high school, which led to my depression/suicidal thoughts and I'll have to take a medical leave.

evolutionarywolfpup,"To Whom It May Concern,  


I am writing this because I feel like I am finally at that point in my life where I would like to pursue a higher education, sadly I did not have the best of luck in the past and was unable to attend the entirety of high school. The reason for this is due to the fact that across my freshman and sophomore year I was having a vast amount of issues with my family as rebelled against them by getting into minor trouble at school. So when my 16th birthday approached I was on a vacation outside of the country visiting my mother when I was told by my father that due to my sexuality and gender identification I was not allowed back home.  


After hearing this I obtained a permanent residency for the county that I was in and researched a way to return to the United States without my father's permission, from this I learned that I could function as an adult at the age of 17 within the majority of the United States, and so I spent the next year working at a burger restaurant and later as a personal assistant while also doing volunteer work for a local children's charity. At one point during this year I attempted to start school at a local university, however, my lack of fluency in their language caused this to be unsuccessful.  


Two days after my 17th birthday I arrived in the United States after saving up and I slept on a friends couch for a month before getting a job in sales, following that I started working for a traveling sales company and worked non-stop for almost a year before deciding that it was time to do more with my life, and that is when I joined the Army.  


I was in the Army for just around a year and a half before I had to leave due to no longer being able to complete the physical side of the job due to a back injury. While in the army I was a Human Intelligence Collector and I also personally began studying anesthesiology with an emphasis on cardiology. Since leaving the Army I have worked a few jobs in sales and management.

I have spoken to many people working in the field (such as the Director of the bioinformatics lab I worked at for a year), and most of them suggested that if I wanted to pursue the subject, the best route would be to do some kind of mathematics major in undergrad, then go to a more computational biology specific phd/masters afterwards. While looking at the maths majors at Dartmouth I noticed that there was a mathematical data science major which appeared to have more flexibility than the applied mathematics major meaning that I could also take more cs and bio classes. At the same time, I feel as if the more mathematically heavy focus of an applied mathematics major could also be very helpful if I wanted to get a postgraduate degree.

I'm really split between Dartmouth and Yale for my ED school. I'm looking at majoring in poli sci/int relations or econ. On one hand, I love Dartmouth for it's undergrad focused student body and the beautiful surrounding nature. I'm a huge environmental science junkie so the surrounding hills and mountains just amazed me with their natural beauty.

However, Yale is much more affordable for my family. While I could afford Dartmouth, it would a huge strain on my family's budget but Yale would be less so. Also, Yale's ""intellectual"" vibe kind of appeals to me. I'm not a huge fan of the party scene even though Dartmouth's party scene is blown out of proportion. 

So with everything in mind, I just can't make a decision. Dartmouth probably appeals to me the most. However, I feel like Yale is more financially affordable and I would fit in better.

Dear prospective participant,

We would like you to participate in a research survey that is being led by Clemson University‚Äôs Analytics and Data Lab. Our survey gauges college students on their perceptions of individual privacy and privacy of location and space and how it relates to trust when adopting an institution led digitized contact tracing application.

* You need to be an undergraduate college student at a two-year or four-year college in the United States.
* This survey will take 10 to 15 minutes to take.
* At the end of the survey is a sign up for optional follow-up interviews that will be led by students of our Analytics and Data Lab.
* Your survey answers remain anonymous outside of the Analytics and Data Lab and will be used internally by us to create a big picture of college students‚Äô point of view on individual location privacy when it comes to a digitized contact tracing application, something that is extremely important in today‚Äôs day and age considering the on-going COVID-19 epidemic.  

   * The only personal identifiable information being collected will be your gender, ethnicity, the college you are currently attending, current class standing, and major.

The survey will open September 1st, 2020, and close October 1st, 2020, or when we reach 200 participants.

Please let us know if you have any questions and again thank you so much.

DartyQs932145,"Hi!

This might be a stupid post but I am going on a water-based DOC trip in a few weeks. I know the swim test is about 1 lap in a pool. To give some background, I am comfortable swimming in general, but I have never been on a swim team or really done competitive swimming.

I am nervous for the swimming test because I cannot do a flip-turn off a wall (when turning around). Also, I think that I am going to embarrass myself because I am slow and I am only doing breaststroke (I'm not even sure if I can do it well). Do you have to do the swim test in front of everyone else (I am only pretty self-conscious btw)? Do the examiners care what type of stroke you are doing and how well you are doing it? Is there a chance that I can fail because my stroke is not the best and I cannot do a flip turn?

Thanks in advance but I am scared that it is going to be SUPER embarrassing because most people probably do competitive swimming. :)

I posted on here earlier about pre-med, but I have questions in general about the university. 

\-How does grading work? Ik that an A is a 4.0 and an A- is a 3.67 but what counts as an A and an A-?

\-How is the grade inflation? Is that a rumor or is it true that top-tier schools inflate grades to supplement stats for med-school acceptances?

\-I still don't know about my financial aid status, but it is highly likely that I will have to pay full price as an upper-middle-class person. I had to pay full price at another private university, so I'm assuming it'll be the same here. My father and I are unemployed and I have a sibling in middle school, so this is not practical, but my parents and I are willing to grind it out. I've also been admitted to UT, which will run me 30-35k/year instead of 80k. My parents think Dartmouth is worth it. **Are there scholarships and grants you can get internally to offset the 80k once you enroll in the university?** My parents think that in the long run, Dartmouth will be worth it because as of rn, I'm trying for a career in medicine, so I can do physician loan forgiveness or pay it back by developing a strong career through the connections I'll make at Dartmouth.

I'm receiving a need-based scholarship through Dartmouth, as well as few merit-based outside scholarships.  

From the financial aid handbook I read that: ""Students who receive scholarships from external sources can use these funds to reduce the loan and/or job portions of their financial aid packages. In some cases, outside scholarships may be used to reduce the EFC, but never below the federally-calculated level.""

A financial aid coordinator told me that I could put any scholarships I earned toward the parent contribution, but if that was the case I would be below the federal level (I'm already at the level pretty much just from the Dartmouth scholarship).

My question is: how will reporting my outside scholarships affect my financial aid? Since I've received conflicting information I'd like to know more before I proceed.

mrcnylmz,"Hello Everybody,

&#x200B;

For next year, I am accepted to Dartmouth's Master of Engineering Management program. I'm considering I'm highly likely to continue with the offer however there are some questions in my mind, mostly focused in financial topics. I am offered program's maximum possible scholarship package but still unsure if this could be accomplished when coupled with the living cost.

&#x200B;

A little background: I'm currently working at a San Francisco based seed stage startup. We are continuing our operations abroad since the burn rate is much lower. I have mechanical engineering and industrial engineering double major degrees but I was always business related, mostly in strategical decision making processes. Have about \~ 2.5-3 years of work experience when I add up part-time experiences.

&#x200B;

I am from Turkey and was in Virginia Tech during 2016 elections as an exchange student. That year the USDTRY was really volatile until that point. As I'm sure you are more accustomed with the situation between US and Turkey and I think it'll be worse than many forecasts. 

&#x200B;

As Dartmouth MEM program was my true goal when I was applying for graduate programs, I really wish to fulfill it. Guys I'm working with stated they'd be more than happy to support me as long as I can allocate the time I'm able, I just want this to be a buffer and out of assumptions.

&#x200B;

I'm asking you a realistic estimation for living expenses in Hanover area for an MEM student. Also I'd really appreciate your help for other scholarship opportunities or ideas for me to destress.

&#x200B;

I want to keep it short for you but I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you all in advance for your comments and help.

I have a day left to decide between here and Berkeley :/ I like the small environment of Dartmouth, but I am worried about the strength of the CS program and how well I'll fit in.

1) How hard is it to get into the Dali labs? When I visited it seemed like there was no other CS club on campus so I think I'd definitely want to get involved there if I were to go to Dartmouth. What other CS related clubs/opportunities are there?

2) What percentage of the class studies CS?

3) I noticed that a lot of people I talked to came into Dartmouth thinking they wanted to study something else then switched to Dartmouth. Do you think the student body overall is kind of weak  because people don't typically come to Dartmouth for CS? I noticed that the career office has almost no statistics about CS employment, which seems kind of odd, because good CS employment statistics would be something that would encourage someone to come to your school. My theory is that Dartmouth doesn't need to have such statistics because people who are planning to major in CS don't even look at Dartmouth. What do you guys think? The reason this is a concern to me is I am afraid I won't be as motivated to work hard if my peers are not serious about CS. I also heard that the best way to get CS interviews is by knowing someone who works at a company and getting them to refer you. If Dartmouth does not have many people who are super serious about CS it'll probably be less likely that my friends who I meet will hold jobs at top companies that I would want to be referred to.

3) How hard/competitive is it to become a TA for a lower division CS course? How many TAs are there? Are the TAs a close knit group?

4) Where have you interned and how did you get your internships/jobs? What's the most common way for Dartmouth CS students to get internships? (Ex. Career fair, online application, referrals)

5) What is your best estimate of the percentage of students who get **interviews** at top tech companies? (ex. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc)

6) At a career fair, how does an employer choose to offer interviews to if there are 100+ people trying to meet them?

7) What are the negatives of studying CS here. It is easy for you guys to say that ""CS at Dartmouth is Great!"", but that doesn't really help me when I'm trying to compare it to other schools, so I would like to hear the cons of this place. Do you ever wish you chose a different school?

8) Did you know you wanted to study CS when you came here? If so and your feel comfortable sharing, what schools did you pick Dartmouth over?

9) If I'm kind of a shy person and not into drinking/partying, so will I feel left out? I heard the culture at Dartmouth revolves around that kind of stuff.

I'm a '24 and I understand that we select majors around sophomore year, but I was wondering how the biomedical engineering sciences or environmental studies majors are doing? I know my career path is subject to change in the next 4 years, but I hope to do a pre-med track between those two majors. 
I would like some clarity on biomedical engineering though. I know there is (generally) three pathways with biomed: industry, research, med school. The reason I was drawn to biomed for its application to health and primarily prosthesis. However, I saw that the major is not ABET-certified and would require an extra year. I also heard that biomedical engineering sciences is catered more towards pre-med students. This is basically all that I know so far about that major at Dartmouth.
As for environmental studies, I was drawn to the opportunities (Institute of Arctic Studies, study abroad conservation trips) and learning part but I'm worried it is a limited major careerwise (in addition to it being a fairly new major). Are there any pre-med environmental studies majors? What career types are environmental studies majors usually drawn to after graduation, etc?

I am in love with the university, I have watched a lot students' videos, read about its programs and talked to people who studies there.

I have read in the website that they have a holistic admission, but I don't know how true is that. I think my ECs are really good, I am an international scholarship winner from the U.S Department of State, I have gotten special mentions in every UN Model I have participated, I have been part of the Student Council for almost 3 years (being a secretary and VP), I have been captain of my school soccer team, I am currently working in a project for girls who cannot access education in my country (it is a 4 day campament with different activities that has support from my government and the U.S), I speak 3 languages and so on.

sunbir8,"Hi! 

I just got into Dartmouth with 50k aid a year. 
I also got into Amherst College with 57k a year. The other good schools I got into are Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, University of Pennsylvania, and Brown University. I will be in 140k debt if I graduate from any of these 3.

I don't know a lot about these colleges as I'm an international student. However, I have read some stuff online. I want to know how accurate it is.

I want to major in computer science because that is something I really want to learn. I am interested in machine learning and AI right now. That might change in the future, given that I just like the idea of it. I don't have a lot of CS experience at the moment. My ultimate goal is not to be a hardcore programmer. I, rather, want to be in a management position, preferably in the tech industry. However, I wouldn't mind being a software engineer either if this option isn't viable. Now that you know a little about me, here are a few questions:

1. How does the CS department at Dartmouth compare with the other universities I mentioned earlier? Will I get enough resources to learn about machine learning and AI? Should I go for a place like CMU, which is probably the best in the world for CS? Is there a huge difference in department quality? Dartmouth is ranked 40 for graduate CS rankings. Should that be a deciding factor for me?
2. How are the job opportunities for computer science majors? Will Silicon Valley companies want to recruit me? I've heard they look for practical knowledge. Will Dartmouth provide me with that knowledge? If not, how am I supposed to gain it?
3. My parents will spend their entire lives' savings to send me here. So, a job that pays well is as important to me as my passion for CS. Will I be able to dual major in CS and Finance (or whatever is required to get into the finance industry, since that is where Dartmouth's strength lies)?
4. My dad has friends in really high positions (VPs, etc.) at both Goldman Sachs and The Bank of America. Will this be of any help to me while looking for internships? Asking this because I heard connections are vital in the finance industry.
5. Can I get an MBA degree from Tuck School of Business in addition to my undergraduate degree if I decide to spend 5 years instead of 4? Is there any provision for this?


Last of all, my heart was set on UPenn because I heard a lot about the social life there and felt that I would like it. I just generally felt that I would be a perfect fit for Penn. I don't think I would be able to afford to study there. Am I missing out on a lot? I don't think I like the fact that Dartmouth is so far from a major city. But, these opinions about finding UPenn to be a better fit and not liking a small city have little foundation. I don't really know what life in America is like, so all this might change when I actually start attending Dartmouth. Unfortunately, I won't be able to visit any of these schools because of financial constraints.

Please tell me some cool things about Dartmouth that'll make me want to study there. Why is a campus town more attractive than Philadelphia? I like meeting different people. Dartmouth is small. Is it so small that it won't allow me to do that?

,"Hey /r/dartmouth, I'm a HS student who's currently looking to apply to Dartmouth next year. First of all, I'd just like to say I love the school. The beautiful campus, the traditions, everything. I'm a social person so I won't have any trouble making friends (and maybe joining a frat), but I have a few questions. 

I've heard many students play varsity sports. I play soccer but my skills aren't really at a ""hey coach come and recruit me"" level. I guess varsity sports don't hold tryouts at Dartmouth, right? (sorry, I'm unfamiliar with the whole process). 

I'm also considering playing other sports, maybe rowing, crew or rugby. Problem is, I've never actually done these sports. Lacrosse will be impossible to play at a varsity level, but what if I buff up a bit (I'm pretty strong), and start using rowing machines?  Do I have a shot at the rowing team?

My team and I are currently working on an app that makes the process of meeting new people easier for students during the pandemic. We want to have people meet that new person who they can vibe and talk to during in spite of online courses. With the help of 500 user responses and several psychology papers, we created a unique profile outline that should match people based on the most important traits. We have deployed a website to gather actual user responses to match and are trying to test and validate our matching algorithm and require people to help us by reviewing their matches. By no means, is our algorithm final and we would love people who are honest and willing to help us out. To make our app a safer place we are restricting it to only college student so we **require .edu emails.**

mrcnylmz,"Hey all,

I'm a 1 year graduate student and currently live in a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom North Park apartment. I am sharing my bathroom with another 1st year graduate student and he leaves the bathroom in unacceptable conditions for a common use area. I talked to him twice about this already but no action taken.

The very same guy uses the common kitchen for 4 of us in the same way too. I noticed that everytime after he used the kitchen, there are always crumbles/jam drops/grease on the counter. Now there is greasy pasta pieces on the kitchen ground. 

As you might have noticed already, the guy doesn't care about hygiene procedures at all. Actually I don't mind this that much whenever he keeps his room's door open we have a heavy odor in the rest of the apartment.

I'm already on my nerves, and other 2 guys are very respectful of the environment around them. This guy persists being a needy adult and harms the other roommates. I talked to our residential fellow about this behavior recently and I believe this might alleviate the issue a little bit I'd be very happy if you can enlighten me about the procedures to follow if that fails.

I believe he has a wealthy family or someone who does the cleaning for himself at his home as his dad visited once and he mentioned he was considering to hire a cleaner to come into our apartment once in a while. I believe at this point of life he should be able to clean after himself and maintain a respectful common area for all.

For those who might be discriminating, the guy mentioned is from New York; so not from another culture.",Terrible roommate in North Park and what to do?,4,0.67,d7wdal,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/d7wdal/terrible_roommate_in_north_park_and_what_to_do/,4,1569214394.0,2019-09-22 23:53:14

Also, are many of the frats relatively similar in general culture of the house (I think that's what they're called), and are they mostly composed of financially well-off students (similar to the eating clubs at Princeton, basically a way to maintain and/or flaunt status) or are there some first-gen students from low-income backgrounds included as well?",Greek Life at Dartmouth - Prospective Student,3,0.72,9u9y6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/9u9y6i/greek_life_at_dartmouth_prospective_student/,3,1541416017.0,2018-11-05 05:06:57

vernazza,"Hi all!

Pint√©r B√©la and Company are one of the most acclaimed independent theater companies of Hungary and have been staging original dramas highly popular with critics and theatergoers both domestically and internationally for over 15 years now. Their most awarded play, *[Our Secrets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LKQqtvHfzE)*, discusses the lives and personal struggles of underground anti-Communist activists in early '80s Hungary as the secret police infiltrates their folk dance group, its tone and theme often compared to Academy Award winning picture [*The Lives of Others*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others). It was the quickest Hungarian play to 100 performances in barely over a year - a significant feat in European repertory theater. The US is the 14th foreign country the show was invited to. 

For a far more eloquent analysis, read Robert Avila's take on it in the American Theatre [here](http://pbest.hu/hu/sajto/194-pieces-de-resistance-in-budapest-with-an-emphasis-on-the-resistance). 

You can catch it [at the Hopkins Center for the Arts tomorrow and Saturday 8pm](https://hop.dartmouth.edu/Online/belapinter). Tickets available from $25. 2 hours without intermission, in Hungarian with English supertitles. For mature audiences only, adult language and graphic sexual content. 

Pre-show Talk on Friday at 7pm in the Faculty Lounge with Hungarian scholar Edit Nagy who'll provide cultural context and an introduction ahead of the show. Post-show discussion with the artists after both performances. 

Hope this didn't sound too badly like a pitch, but for the record: I am not affiliated with the Company in any ways other than being an avid fan. The play really is fantastic, so anyone interested in Hungary or contemporary theater should go and check it out! If you have any questions feel free to ask.

transferthrowaway007,"hey guys,

I'm a student at a college in new york city. The reasons I'm looking to transfer are pretty simple. At my college, there's a limit on the number of classes that I can take each semester i.e. Every semester, I am charged ~34k for tuition. Now, the problem is that tuition is charged per credit. In the tuition that I pay, I'm allowed to take 18 credits per semester, which means I can take 4 4-credit classes per semester and 1 2-credit class (The 2-credit classes are useless for me -- they are classes like drama, acting, instrument -- things that I'm not interested in). However, if I want to take more than 18 credits, I'll have to pay ~2k extra per credit that I take. So, if I take a 4-credit class over the 4 4-credit classes limit, then I'm paying ~8-10k extra per semester just for one class.


This limits the number of classes (consequently my education opportunities) that I can take each semester. I'm interested in economics, applied math, and linguistics. However, I can't complete a double major, forget a triple major (or a double major and a minor) without taking classes during the summer, and in the summer, I would like to focus on more important things like internships, research, etc.


The reason paying ~10k (or more if I want to take more classes) extra is a problem is, I've taken a loan to attend college. 10k (or more) per semester for 4 years is a problem because I can't afford to take on more loans than that I've already taken.


Another reason I'm interested in transferring is because of the math major. My college doesn't offer a separate major in applied math (not that dartmouth does too), despite having one of the best math dept. that's known for applied math. in the world. There are a couple of applied math classes that I can take, but I think that having a proper structured course in applied math (which dartmouth does) will give me more knowledge about and exposure to the field. I'm interested in the math major at Dartmouth. I saw the applied math roadmap on the department's webpage, and it was definitely a proper structured thing and offered a lot of relevant courses, unlike that at my college.


So my question is, at Dartmouth, are you charged tuition per semester or tuition per credit? Is there a strict limit on the number of classes that you can take in a semester (I don't care about the recommended limit. I'm paying lots of money, so I might as well take full advantage and challenge myself) i.e is it something like that at my college (take 4/5 classes, and then pay extra money if you want to take more?)? Can I take more classes w/o paying more money than that what's already charged for tuition?

hopelesslyunromantic,"Hi all, I'm a rising senior and am seriously considering applying ED this fall to Dartmouth, with a few reservations. I have visited once, and I loved the location, and the school just felt right, unlike when I visited some other schools. 2220 SAT, 3.9ish GPA UW, and within top 10% of my graduating class. 

Reasons for Applying:
Small school,
Beautiful campus,
Ivy,
undergrad only (professors are there to teach, not for research or other things),
Rural, 
Great for my major (Government),
Strong alumni network (from what I understand)

Things I'm worried about:
I'm not really a huge partier and am pretty introverted in general so I'm worried that my lack of interest in drinking/greek life will isolate me,
I'm pretty liberal, and, from what I understand, Dartmouth is known to be one of the more conservative Ivies,
Not sure how LGBTQ+ friendly the campus is,
Knowing that it's an Ivy I'm worried about the potentially 'cutthroat' nature of academic competition (a friend of mine at Yale has told me horror stories about 'sleep shaming' and some sabotage)

First off, Northeastern isn‚Äôt the most highly ranked school on the planet for IR/econ ‚Äî Niche has it at around 20th for IR, but most sites have it between 40-60; it‚Äôs basically the same story for econ. Obviously there are stories of people transferring from lower-ranked schools, but I‚Äôd assume my chances would be better if I were at some higher-ranked school, no? 
Secondly, I didn‚Äôt do so great in high school ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt poor: I had an unweighted GPA of 3.6ish and an SAT in the 1400s, all this while taking honors and AP for all but one of my classes and taking part in lots of extracurriculars, notably Model UN, in which I was the vice president ‚Äî but I obviously wasn‚Äôt Dartmouth material at the time. 
This leads me to my final point: I got rejected as an ED applicant from Dartmouth out of high school. I don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôll look at that when I fill out my transfer application, but surely it can‚Äôt be a positive, no? I‚Äôm definitely a much better student and person overall than I was in high school, but it still casts a bit of a shadow over me that I‚Äôm not sure I can get rid of.

Maybe I‚Äôm a bit too pessimistic ‚Äî logically, I should be, given the transfer acceptance rate at Dartmouth‚Äî but I feel a sense of optimism at the same time that if I keep up my grades, write a great essay, and get some good recommendations, I should be fine. 

If you guys have any advice for the transfer process or can add anything to my situation in general, feel free to do so. I‚Äôm sorry if this post is a bit poorly written, as I‚Äôve got little time to write and I‚Äôm on my phone, so if anything needs to be clarified don‚Äôt hesitate to say so. Thank you!

User182930438,"
I am a white guy from South Africa. 
I wrote the SAT and 2 subject tests (1430 and 790 for math 2, literature result too bad to mention haha), but am now undecided as to whether I will even apply anywhere in the states. My situation is that I have very strong options to study here in South Africa. I was drawn to the states because of the whole feeling of adventure it gave me (and still does). Like most internationals, I've spent an unhealthy amount of time watching random youtube acceptance videos, researching various form of financial aid, etc. Dartmouth stood out to me because of anecdotal descriptions I‚Äôve come across online, summarised as: heavy drinking culture, friendly, outdoorsy, chill. Also the whole liberal arts education idea was so foreign to me at first but I have come to be almost desperate to experience it for myself.

Enough droning on though, what I really hope to gain from some strangers (you) on reddit is whether or not you could see someone like me fit in and enjoy my experience.

Dreyeris,"Hello, I had a couple questions about the process of earning pre-matriculation transfer credit. Dartmouth's policy for this on the website states that the following information is necessary to apply for pre-matriculation transfer credit:

>* Pre-matriculation Transfer Credit Form (PDF) with signature from department/program chair or designee
* Official transcript from the prior institution
* Course description and syllabi
* Documentation to verify that the courses and/or credits did not fulfill your high school graduation requirements

Okay, so filling out the PDF and finding the syllabi for the courses I've taken is not a problem. 

My first question: the college that I took my dual enrollment courses at during high school gives me the option either to have my transcript sent directly to Dartmouth or to have it sent in a sealed envelope to my house. If I take the first option, what address exactly am I supposed to have the transcript sent to to ensure that it is received properly? On the other hand, is it better to take the second option so that I can send everything to Dartmouth at once in a single package? And in that case once again what address should I be sending it to (should it just be the main *Dartmouth* address or somewhere else? I haven't been able to find any address online specifically for the Office of the Registrar).

My second question: What counts as proof ""that the courses and/or credits did not fulfill [my] high school graduation requirements""? Should I send the Registrar a copy of my high school transcript and a copy of my high school's course catalog to prove that the dual enrollment courses I took were in excess of what the graduation requirements are at my high school?

If anyone is able to help me out with these questions or any other part of this process, it would be very much appreciated! Thanks!

EDIT: Well I'm kind of stupid. I just found the address of the Office of the Registrar online, lol. But I still need help with my other questions!

,"Okay so I am super stressed out and at the same time, fairly certain about applying ED to Dartmouth. 


Reasons I love Dartmouth: Everything about it, really - small size, only undergrad, the campus looks super pretty, Thomas Cormen (CLRS <3 ) is in the CS dept, and ESPECIALLY the fact that (everyone says) it's laidback and relaxed despite everyone being hardworking and super smart (Coming from India, I am so sick of ""cutthroat competition"") and also I have heard/read that it's study-abroad programs are some of the best and I love the idea of that. And I have one really unique reason too which I am going to keep to myself ;) (which is what I will probably frame my Why Dartmouth essay around). 


Female, International (Asian...Indian *sighs*)

Comp Sci 

Family income: <25000$ so I need aid. Lots of aid. I know Dartmouth is need-aware for int and all, but I've heard/read that it's still pretty generous with aid?


Stats:

-SAT I: 1490 (first try ~1 week prep - will be retaking in Oct...probably 1550+)

-SAT II: Not taken yet, but I'll be doing Math 2, Physics and Literature in June. If one or more of those is a disaster- I'll take them in Nov. 

A very bad time crunch here, but I only seriously decided to apply last year so.


Grades:

Um not the best...rather one of the weakest parts of my already weak application. Instead of going into detail about how the grading works, I'll just leave you with my approx class rank

-9th and 10th: 10-20/300 (95% in ICSE Boards)

-11th: So we had three terms, 1st: 10-20/350-400 2nd: 100/300 3rd: 100/300. So yeah, shit happened. Mostly because I switched schools after 10th and my new school was super competitive and JEE focused (if anyone knows what that is) and a bunch of other stuff. 

-12th: Fairly certain I'll recuperate back to 10-20, looking at our internal class tests etc. I'll be submitting my 1st and 2nd term marks.


ECs and other stuff (pretty weak but here goes)

- Winner of a Google coding contest ( top 50 out of 3500+ participants. This is literally my biggest EC lol and I'll be going to MTV in June so yay for that!)

- Hosting a ""free"" conference to encourage CS/Tech for high-school students in Sept/Oct this year. 
- Founded a ""club"" (but not really, as clubs aren't a thing at my present school) on CS for students of the city. It's more than a regular club (community, perhaps?) but whatevr. 

- Interned at a NY based startup as a software dev

- Classical dancing for like 7 years maybe

- And a whole lot of random shit: Scouts and Guides, Badminton State Champion, some regional quiz, House Captain/Student Council, volunteering with NGOs to design their websites, a lot of intra school awards etc
(and I do have a somethings planned for this year so we'll see ;)) 


Random info:

-I read a lot (Seriously, a LOT. I had a Goodreads goal of 100 books/year in 2016. Those were the days :')) so that's what I was doing all these years (before I got into CS last year when I got my first laptop :') though I still make time for books

-And I did take (or was chosen to) the hardest classes at my new school. I was placed in a ""special"" section. (probably can get my principal (we don't have a school counselor) to write about that)
Oh and LoRs will be pretty great, esp the ones from my older school


So, is it, in any way, worth applying? (Because looking at the profiles of most people in my country left me really, really discouraged. And not just Dartmouth, I am wondering if it's worth it applying to ANY of the colleges I am going to apply to in the US.) Also, if someone (preferably current student) could tell me about the CS program there it'd be pretty great.

i-judge-hippos,"Hi

As a 19, I was asked to write out a short essay for a writing placement.  I have a few questions about this.  First of all, why am I the only one of my friends that was asked to do this?  Does being asked to fill this out mean that they think I have the ability to be in a more advanced English course, or does it mean that they don't think I have the ability to even be in the normal English course?

Second of all, which course is better?  I plan to major in the sciences, so I don't understand why I would want to take 2-3, which would just take more time and be (what it sounds like) more work.  However, if it really is a better course than the 5, then I obviously want to take it.

I am honestly not super into writing essays, and I just want to take a chill class with chill people.  However, I do like a challenge and if the class is too easy (which I doubt, at Dartmouth, any class will ever be easy), I will get bored and end up hating it.

I am twenty-nine and live in Charleston, South Carolina with my wife and son(7). I served in the Navy for ten years ending in April of this year. I have spent the last couple semesters attending a local community college and it has gone well. But its time for me to find another place to receive my education. There are limits to the personal growth that can be found at a community college. I had some very special experiences in the Navy and learned much about myself, a passion for lifelong learning and a deep need to help my community. Inside me is this deep need to develop myself into a well rounded person. I have these convictions but I can feel these limits that bind them. Finding a place that can foster these things and an opportunity to share my experiences with others is very important to me. 

I imagine(hope for you) that many of these ideas are paramount to you. 

Is this a place I could find comfortable? For many of the people who enlist the military, an Ivy League school is a foreign, nearly mythical, place where a different class of person exists.

,"Hi, reddit! I applied to Dartmouth regular decision and will be getting my decision this Thursday, and I was interested in asking current Dartmouth students about the strength of these departments/graduate placement.

I'm really interested in getting a PhD in either philosopher or economics and possibly going on to teach, and I wanted to ask how strong these departments are in terms of graduate placement (especially philosophy - I've heard it's impossible to get a job unless one gets his PhD from a top 10-ish philosophy grad school, which is worrying). 

Dartmouth doesn't 'rank highly' in some of these fields, but I've heard a lot of that is just attributed to the undergraduate focus (research intensive grad schools inflate the ratings for larger universities), but there's not a huge amount of info on the Dartmouth website about these departments, so I really don't know where I'd have the academic 'edge' for grad school.


I applied to a few other schools (the other Ivies minus Brown and Cornell plus Stanford... tbh, I was mostly interested in Columbia, Harvard, and Dartmouth, but my parents wanted me to apply to the others), plus I got into the University of Michigan honors (Umich is very strong in philosophy and ranks pretty highly in economics too). I was rejected from my first choice (Uchicago), and I guess I'll see on Thursday where else I get in.

I've not visited Dartmouth - if I get in, I think I'd have to make the trip before deciding, just because it's such a different environment (from where I currently live - urban Great Lakes region). But my parents used to live in Hanover and they loved it there, so they're really encouraging me to go if I get in. My interviewer was really enthusiastic and told me he'd give me the best rec he'd ever given, and I indicated an interest in debating for Dartmouth in college. I don't think I've got a 'great' chance of getting in (I have decent grades - a couple Bs, mostly because I miss like a month of school every year for policy debate - and SATs in the range - 2290 or 2300, I forget), but I'm hopeful about it. My interviewer said I ""have to get into Dartmouth"" and was very excited about it, so I'm hopeful for this Thursday.

Also, I'm a pretty dorky kid - I don't drink and I don't like sports (I'm not like... sociopath-level aspergers or anything, but I'm not really an extrovert). Do you think fitting in would be a problem? That's one of my concerns about umich (that it's rowdy potsmokers at a football game... I get the impression that the honors college is different b/c some of my friends are at umich honors reporting to me about it, but the big, state university campus kinda turns me off, even though it's an academically rigorous place). My Dartmouth interviewer was joking about drinking in college and how awesome Animal House was... Do you find that's still the environment at Dartmouth? I feel weird for asking whether or not Dartmouth is ""more serious"" than that image portrays, because the students there are obviously very strong. But do you think the beerkegs drown out the academic environment at all, or do you think I'd be fine/I'd still be able to socialize normally at Dartmouth?


**So... generic ""why Dartmouth?"", strength of philosophy/econ departments (specifically PhD level graduate placement), campus culture... and anything else you feel an incoming student should know?**

Napsu1t,"Hello, snazzy title I know, but can anyone tell me what they think about my situation please?

I just got done with my interview (it was a phone call, I don‚Äôt think I have an alumni in my area), and we really connected! She has a twin, I have a twin. She was from Michigan, I am from Michigan. We had a good conversation, but I think I was weak at some points. It definitely wasn‚Äôt bad, I would say that I definitely showed that I LOVED Dartmouth, but may have sounded shy. 

Anyway, to my main point!

Their website says interviews are from early Jan to middle Feb. It‚Äôs late Feb though? I‚Äôm I just a ‚Äúthrow him a bone‚Äù candidate? A leftover? She didn‚Äôt say anything like ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôd be a good fit‚Äù or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre Dartmouth material‚Äù like other Dartmouth interviewers have said according to the internet. Does this mean that it went poorly and I didn‚Äôt really know it?

Dartmouth is my #1!!!! I hope she got the vibe, do you think these are signs that I won‚Äôt have a good interview write-up on my application? Should I email her thanking her (she was absolutely wonderful)? Should I continue to discuss Dartmouth and how I‚Äôm currently taking an online Dartmouth and Harvard class (o didn‚Äôt  get the chance to tell her that). She lives in NY city and was busy. She was a little late to the call (~7 min after it was supposed to be, she said she was running late), and said she was sorry she had to go and wished she had more time to talk when we were hanging up (I suppose she was busy), so does that mean she actually thought it was good and she was short on time? 

I‚Äôm confused, sorry for the rant, do you think this will hurt/help me at all in the Dartmouth admissions?

2) What was unexpected TO YOU about the D culture?

3) What are the best things about D?

5) How are the Econ/math departments? Am I even going to sleep?

My father is an alumni of Dartmouth, which I know plays some kind of role in the admissions process, but the rest of my application is up in the air.  I moved from North Carolina to Florida, essentially splitting my high school years in two, and now my grades aren't quite what they used to be.  I took 2 APs as a sophomore and now I'm taking 5 as a Junior.  My GPA last semester was the lowest it's ever been, a 4.1, and I'm struggling now to keep my sights on Dartmouth.  Dartmouth has been my #1 choice my whole life, as I've always wanted the name and the lifestyle that comes along with being a Dartmouth student.
