HarvardDating,"Congratulations, you were admitted to Harvard. You're one of us, but with great power comes great responsibility. I'm not talking academic responsibility, but properly respecting the Harvard name. We're a special breed. People are out to get us, and it's the job of all of us to maintain the prestige behind the name.

You've probably already ordered your Harvard, Champion brand hoodie from the Coop. You made a good choice, it's the best hoodie. But the next time you're at Chipotle and wearing it alongside your friends going to Brown, Cornell, or worse, *Yale,* do you know how to properly address the fact that yes, you do in fact go to Harvard?

Here's a little guide of the time tested responses to the typical situations Harvard students may find themselves in having to discreetly explain that you're better than whomever you may be speaking to.

**Ordering at Starbucks:** If you're getting a hot drink, make sure you ask for one of the red holiday cups. If they ask why, just a simple ""I'm a Harvard student"" will do the trick. They may give you a funny look, but it's jealousy, don't worry about it. Persist until you get your red cup, you wouldn't want to be seen with a green cup and have people think you go to Dartmouth.

**Talking to a parent's friend:** Your parents are going to brag about you. Get used to it, it's the rest of your life. You need to lean to embrace it. Play the offence. Ask them where their children are going to college, such that you have the upper hand in saying ""I'm attending Harvard in the fall."" You don't want to be cornered. You'll receive an array of responses. ""That's very impressive, your parents must be so proud!"" Tell the truth, don't beat around the bush. ""It is, and they are"" is the only proper response. Veritas means truth, after all.

**On a date:** This one is tricky. Being self confident is important. It's good to let them know in the first few minutes, primarily to quickly figure out if they're a Yalie. The easiest option is to buy Harvard socks, and as soon as you meet, go down to tie your shoe. Your pant leg will rise, and their eyes will be drawn to your socks. It's discrete, but a good power move.

**Being asked about college but you're unsure how to mention you go to Harvard:** This one takes work. People can sense the Harvard on you, but they'll often ask for confirmation. The easiest option is to say ""I'm a student at the college."" Don't mention Harvard at first. This is to establish that once they ask ""which college?"" it's implied that they should have assumed Harvard. If they ask what you're studying, philosophy is the best answer. They're expecting finance, but philosophy will help further establish your intellectual dominance over them. Also, remember, it's **concentration**, not major.

**Talking to your friends:** Your friends already know you're superior to them, but a bit of consoling for their admittance to Bowdoin or Wesleyan won't kill you. ""That program there is great"" is a good response to their concerns. Don't mention the discrepancy in endowment size, unless reassuring them that no college really needs more than 2bn anyway (make sure your fingers are crossed behind your back, just to be safe). If you're missing them, make sure you go visit them. You don't want them seeing how much better you have it, and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.

I'm sure you've all updated your Facebook/Instagram/Tinders already, but make sure to do so now if you're yet to. You're going to have a great two years here before you start your business and drop out, make sure to make the most of them. Remember, don't be downwind of John when you and your friends go to pee on him, and, most importantly, YUCK FALE!","Prefrosh, listen up",351,0.95,a64il6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/a64il6/prefrosh_listen_up/,25,1544820416.0,2018-12-14 14:46:56
986970,"I was a waiter at a local Italian place the summer after my senior year of high school. I was serving a couple probably in their mid-40s, and they started lecturing me about the importance of an education and how being a waiter isn't the best way to spend your life.

I kept quiet because I felt like they had good intentions, but then the guy started bragging about how he had two Phd's in music theory (???) and the girl mentioned that not everyone has the ""means"" to get into college (maybe she was trying to defend me, but it came off as very condescending).

When I handed them the cheque, I thanked them for their advice and told them I actually was going to college in the fall.

weenies_with_bread,"As a rising Senior, after getting over my initial shock, I am certain that Harvard made the right call here. 

The whole country seems to have stopped caring, even though we still know hardly anything about covid. I was listening to a nyt podcast today that said covid isn’t even a respiratory illness, it’s a vascular illness that attacks your blood vessels and causes millions of blood clots in your body. The cough is just a side affect of this, by the time your coughing it’s already done damage to your kidneys, brain, literally every organ. It mutates every two weeks, with a mutation in Italy resulting in it being up to 10x more contagious then the Wuhan strain. 

It’s going to be an absolute shit show at college campuses in the fall. Headlines like “Every student at Cornell forced to quarantine, 20 dead, over 60% of students positive”. Harvard starting small with a pilot program they are likely to be able to manage is the smart thing to do. And bringing back freshmen first is also the smart thing to do. 

You can be upset at the decision and recognize that it was the right one. I think in hindsight we will recognize that this was the right decision",Flaming hot take id never make if not anonymous,261,0.95,hmb6jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/hmb6jc/flaming_hot_take_id_never_make_if_not_anonymous/,60,1594082797.0,2020-07-06 19:46:37
HarvardDating,"By now I'm sure you're all aware that classes after spring break will be held virtually. ""But HarvardDating, how will I flex as hard digitally as I do on campus?"" It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&adults=1&check_in=2020-04-22&check_out=2020-04-30&source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from. Make sure to wash your hands before you eat those McChickens, and only cough on the Yalies.",Unsure of how to flex now that classes will be online?

thedietitian,"With the onslaught of celebratory grad school, commencement, and internship posts on Facebook, I thought I would throw a glitch in the matrix and share my story: I was rejected from every summer internship that I applied to. It's the (supposedly) all-important junior summer, and I have nothing to do. But to be honest, I'm kind of okay with it. 

I think rejection stories are extremely important to share. I don't think we hear about them at Harvard as much as we should, but there's beauty in vulnerability. I started applying to summer internships several months ago. I even made it to the third round of interviews at my dream internship, and the company didn't even have the courtesy to let me know I was rejected. I had to ask them. After the onslaught of rejection letters sent to my inbox, I even began applying to random, mostly unpaid internships I found on Indeed, and I didn't get those either. I even applied to sell books at Barnes & Noble and I didn't get that too! And that was supposed to be Plan C.

But I want people to know that it's okay to get rejected. It totally happens. Rejection is not a reflection of your qualifications and self-worth. I do believe there's beauty in doing nothing, and I'm going to spend the summer entertaining myself and achieving my personal goals. I have every intention of sitting on my behind and watching 19+ seasons of Million Dollar Listing. I also want to get in shape and finally read the books on my bucket list that I haven't been able to because of schoolwork. Every time you get rejected from something, you can focus on something that you chose to do and what's truly meaningful to you. I like to think of it this way: I don't have to slave over a task delegated to me by a superior. This summer, I'm charting my own path.

My family is pretty upset about all the nothing I'm doing, and I'm not really sure how to address that. They have high expectations. But I have to say, I'm semi-happy with how my summer is going. Sure, it's cool that my peers are doing internships at Facebook, Google, and L'Oréal. But I also think it's really important to cast rejection in a positive light. You own the time that you've been given. You're free to define the hours as you see fit. I hate waking up at the crack of dawn, and now I can spend my time sleeping until the early afternoon. I hate commuting, and I've gained back three hours of time I would've spent commuting roundtrip.

throwawayharvard2021,"Hello. Throwaway here.

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

MillionaireWaltz-,"Cambridge has plenty of parks and family spots...a campus shouldn't be that 'place' during a pandemic.

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person and any usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me.

I've had visitors get right up on me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

People who are not students are hanging around and getting way too close no matter where you are.

Yesterday, I saw a woman let her child **urinate** on the grass in the middle of the Old Yard. Where people (like me) sit and study.

In short - students have a reason to be here - you (random families, tourists, locals who consider Harvard a 'park') **do not**. Not during this semester, I mean.

miamiedge,"Now that ""the trial"" is underway, there have been so many inaccurate statements on this sub about that cold-hard-facts. Some facts:

&#x200B;

(1) Fact: Asian-Americans do get admitted at [significantly lower](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_USC932_0.png) rate than other minorities. Neither side disagrees on this.

&#x200B;

(2) Fact: Both sides used the same data sets to achieve their separate conclusions (led by Prof. Card for the defense and Prof.  Arcidiacono for the plaintiffs.) More on this later.

&#x200B;

(3) Fact: Asian-Americans get lower personality scores (specifically ""likability"" ratings) by admission officers who have not met them but know their race.

&#x200B;

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

&#x200B;

The most important is #6 as that is an incorrect explanation seen around here a lot. If you have economics or statistics training, please see my detailed explanation in this comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/9nelz5/antiasian\_bias\_not\_affirmative\_action\_is\_on\_trial/e7qy2rn/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/9nelz5/antiasian_bias_not_affirmative_action_is_on_trial/e7qy2rn/?context=3)

Willing_Breadfruit,"English 175D The Rhetoric of Douglass & Lincoln is the best course at Harvard. I want to preface this by saying that I'm a CS concentrator and I hate political courses. I've taken some history courses where the prof just wanted to tell us how he felt about contemporary politics and I wanted to shoot myself. 

175D is amazing first and foremost because Prof. John Stauffer is a legend. He runs the course as a discussion but still brings his input in an interesting way. He is such an eloquent, erudite man that it's insane his course is as small as it is. 

The course covers rhetoric and speeches around the Civil War. The topics are hard hitting. You'll be discussing things that are in active debate today -- racism, slavery, the role of protest, freedom and government. However, and this is amazing to me, the class never got political for me. 

I couldn't tell you what Prof. Stauffer's political beliefs are (though I could make some guesses) and while we were discussing very emotional issues, taking it through the lens of rhetoric and Lincoln/Douglass allowed the class to express themselves in what I thought was a very genuine way.

Further, it's easy. You do have reading for each class and some papers throughout the semester. However, it's one of those courses that you'll be engaged in enough to not feel like you're forcing yourself to sit down and work on it.

I'm not sure how it would be on Zoom, but I can't recommend the in-person experience enough.",The best course at Harvard (imo),72,0.95,gxw3cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/gxw3cc/the_best_course_at_harvard_imo/,11,1591496232.0,2020-06-06 21:17:12
HarvardDating,"While students at other institutions may spend their time thinking about their grades, future careers, or their LinkedIn, Harvard students have a unique set of problems they face: **How to complete the three traditions as quickly as possible.**


No, going as a Yalie for your first Halloween in Cambridge isn't a tradition, but looking around you'll be led to believe it is. The three traditions I'm talking about, of course, are having sex in the stacks, peeing on John Harvard, and participating in the Primal Scream. While STEM concentrations may think they're too busy to do any of this, or that people couldn't *actually* be having sex in Widener, us social science concentrations are well aware of the social pressures put onto every student here to partake in these traditions prior to graduating.

If you're determined, any dedicated Harvard student can complete the trifecta of traditions in less than 10 minutes. Luckily, since typically [65% of the matriculating class are virgins,](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/harvards-class-2017-full-virgins-and-thats-okay/311342/) none of you should have any problem completing **step one: having sex in the stacks** in a matter of minutes. The hardest part of this is agreeing on which section to practice procreation in. While Greek Philosophy is a popular one, I typically choose the *Love Languages* section, just to set the mood a bit.

Once you've completed the first task and left Widener, you should have about 7 minutes left, which is more than enough time to get over to the John Harvard statue. This step is arguably the most important, as **step two: peeing on John Harvard** doesn't only serve to complete the tradition, but is an important measure to take in order to prevent UTIs. Depending on the equipment of your partner you may have to give them a lift, or help each other up, but synchronizing streams, while not necessary, is certainly preferred.

Conveniently, this act can be used to kill two birds with one stone, and **step three: the Primal Scream** is generally an involuntary reaction to the burning sensation you feel while peeing on John after having sex with a stranger in the stacks. Be sure to make it a good one, this is your moment. Everyone's eyes are on you, people are leaning out of Thayer to cheer you on, and they want to hear a walloping, unadulterated scream. Similar to step two, this is a good opportunity to team up with your partner and harmonize a bit. Give the Krokodiloes a run for their money.

After dismounting from the statue, you should have just under a minute left, which is just enough time for the two of you to decide which of you is running to the HEM, and which to Malkin, for you both to shower the shame off. Shake dry hands, congratulate each other, and begin sprinting your separate ways into the night.",Looking to speed run the three traditions?,73,0.93,cmztpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/cmztpo/looking_to_speed_run_the_three_traditions/,6,1565172962.0,2019-08-07 05:16:02

bigbluebottle123,"Two years ago. I applied early action, never expected to get in, but when I did, I then immediately accepted my offer - because it's Harvard. I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action. Maybe I'm desperate to not be completely miserable, but can someone give me a reason as to why Harvard is the right choice over these other schools?

ToddJaycubs,"I am a recent transfer to the University of Toronto from Harvard University, and while many believe Math 55 to be the most difficult undergraduate mathematics course in North America, the many are wrong. In truth, MAT 157 is the most difficult of such courses, delving into topics generally not covered by even the most experienced of Real Analysts. 

&#x200B;

In the first week, we cover Horseshoe Analysis, showing that even the most insane integrals can be shown to be true with a simple symbological statement. Horseshoe functions are integrable in real space. Currently, we are exploring applications of Horseshoe Induction in the Riemann Hypothesis over finite vector ring spaces. Our class, which began with 250 people, currently hosts 25 attendees, 10 of which who are currently viewing the material from the local psych ward. Over the weekend, we had the pleasure of proving the Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) over finite fields in real space. The only prerequisite of this course is High School Calculus, with recommended courses in Latin and Greek Philosophy. All students are required to attend seminars ranging from 5 hours to 11 hours a day in which students discuss Richard and Mortimer and the metaphysical implications of the topics discussed.

My simple critique is that no one here gives a shit about you and everyone is too self-centered in pursuing his or her own goals. It seems like most of the relationships I’ve made in this past semester, platonic or romantic, are more based on networking than any real form of intimacy. Cull those posts about such “genuine friends” that I see friends making on social media... it’s only now that they seem more and more contrived and fake as ever. But in a place so intelectually revered it’s perhaps not even ironic that no one has any further personal investment. Everyone seems to just want to network or hook up at parties instead. It’s neurotic, nauseating, and altogether numbing. Some upperclassmen friends say that Northeastern, Tufts, MIT, even Wellesley would have better scenes for meeting people for romantic relationships. Frankly I’ve enjoyed what college here has been in terms of its intellectual and extracurricular opportunities so far but socially and especially the dating scene have been utterly, intolerably disappointing.

scattergraph,"Edit: Addressed by mods. Thanks!

Although the first rule is very clear, one third to one half of the posts in the sub are about admissions. But we know that it is not that people are willingly violating the rules, they are all first- time posters and do not read the rules. As such, bans or other deterrents do not work. Seeing other subs that deal with similar problems, I have two proposals:

1. Get Automoderator to comment on posts with keywords such as ""admissions"", ""alumni"", ""waitlist"" ""transfer"". The comment can remind them the first rule. This way, they are likely to read the rule and remove the post if appropriate;                              or,

granta50,"I completed my degree 15 years ago, and I've really struggled with it since. I loved my classes and professors, and the work in general, it was all truly wonderful, but I avoid talking about my degree at all costs. 

I either find that people don't know what the Extension School is, and they think my degree is more prestigious than it is (which is embarrassing to then have to explain to them that no, don't get the impression that I'm anywhere near the level of a Harvard College graduate), or they have some misconception about the ES. Whenever anyone misinterprets my degree as being more prestigious than it is, even after I explain to them that I went to the Extension School and not the college, I feel like an absolute fraud. 

I guess I wish I had gone to school somewhere where if someone asked where I went, I could just say the university's name and have that be the end of it, not have to qualify my standing there. Like if I'd gone to night school at say, [X] State University, I feel like if someone asked where I went to school I could just say ""[X] State"" and that'd be all I'd have to say. That's my own fault obviously and clearly I should have thought of that before enrolling.

throwaway183613,"Hello Community, I am an incoming freshman with the goal of studying math at Harvard. I want to eventually study for a PhD in math but I have a couple of questions, if I may? 


First, obviously Math 55 catches my attention and I would like to take it but I wonder if it might be too overwhelming for my first year. Does anyone have any insight into the workload for that class? If I am eventually going to be introduced to, in other math classes, all of the topics covered in this one class, I don't see it as beneficial to me to suffer through an accelerated class that throws it all at me at once. Can I learn all the topics covered in Math 55 through other math courses at Harvard spread across my undergraduate curriculum?


Second, is it common for undergraduate math students to remain at Harvard for their PhD studies as well? I am very interested in the work of one of the professors at Harvard on computational number theory. I was thinking I would like to study under him for my future PhD.

MongolianBotanist,"Last semester was overall a really good one for me. I met so many great people, and I am grateful I was able to so quickly find a niche at the big bustling nerve-wracking world of Harvard.

A big part of that was thanks to the Harvard Crimson, which was far more welcoming and accepting than I could have hoped for. It's truly such a great organization. Its comp process was long and challenging, but my comp directors made the experience completely manageable, light-hearted, and fun. We got to publish multiple articles and benefitted from the experience and expertise of thoughtful, wise editors.

So the Crimson-ICE controversy absolutely broke my heart. On multiple occasions, it brought me to tears. I am a sensitive person, and I try my best to be a moral person. I'm quite left-wing, and strongly support abolish ICE, the decriminalization of immigration, and taking in as many refugees as possible.

And yet I can't escape a simple, clear conviction I have come to: The Crimson was in the right, Act on a Dream in the wrong.

Act on a Dream was absolutely unreasonable in their demands and thoughtless in their actions. The main purpose of a public protest is to demonstrate public support for a cause. The free press has an obligation to scrutinize and duly report on protests, which benefits just social movements by spreading their message and reach. Reaching out to a government agency for comment is never an endorsement of said agencies' actions, nor does it inherently put students in danger. If ICE wanted to prey on undocumented students at Harvard, they would do so regardless of if a comment is asked. ICE's non-comment on the article is demonstrative of their uncaring attitudes to the lives of this country's many brilliant and brave undocumented students. Therefore, the Crimson, without resorting to biased reporting, was able to demonstrate the strength and moral conviction of the Abolish ICE movement in Harvard's community.

Then, Act on a Dream threw that all away by attacking the Crimson for conducting a routine component of journalism. The boycott by various Harvard student groups only did three things: ensure that their efforts and movements would not be reported on with their voice accounted for, cause people both in and outside of the Harvard community to think less of these vital causes, and spread misinformation about the actions and the nature of the Crimson as an organization. I've talked to many students, all otherwise smart and lovely people, who had completely warped views of the situation. Some thought the Crimson literally gave ICE the names of undocumented students, or that we collaborated with them to undermine the protest. I heard people talking about vandalizing the Crimson's headquarters. When people don't trust the Crimson, they will have trouble gaining a full, nuanced perspective on complex campus issues.

Student activists have wasted so much time and effort attacking their fellow students, and allies in making Harvard a fair and just community. It makes me so upset the wasted potential this unnecessary conflict created.

I want us all to move on

So, as an anonymous internet person, I hope that we all can find peace and cooperation in the next semester. I hereby give full, unconditional forgiveness to the people who have slandered my peers, and caused the national press to ridicule the Harvard activist community. I love you all, and I know most of you are good people.

If you want to make a difference on campus, one of the best ways is to comp the Crimson this coming semester. We have a generous financial aid program and do not cut anyone during the comp. All are welcome. Love and mercy everyone.",Harvard Crimson,47,0.9,eoe0uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/eoe0uq/harvard_crimson/,3,1578994309.0,2020-01-14 03:31:49
KantianCant,"Here’s the abstract:

>	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no one’s surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

>	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn’t really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

They think I got in because of my scholarly records, but no the key is the interview. As I sat in the Harvard Dean's office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean asks me ""Why should you be a good candidate for this school?"" They seemed bored but I replied ""Well I was born a child prodigy, placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different languages not counting Latin, play four different instruments, I skipped grades 4 through 6, and graduated my high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA."" Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down ""No"" near the application check marks. The Dean says ""Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for."" But then I said ""Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty"" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said ""So....?"" Then I replied with a smile ""And I understand all the references and subtle jokes"" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in.

gdavtor,"Hello all! I am updating the automoderator in response to some suggestions regarding Rule 1 violations. Thank you for the input! We should hopefully be seeing fewer blatant rule 1 violations from now on.


---

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

Removed | Not Removed
---|---
[Exhibit A](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bjbaqy/about_to_be_a_graduate_from_hes_with_extension/) | [Exhibit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/admddj/hes_what_time_are_grades_posted/) 
[Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5ji6qb/can_i_tell_my_friends_i_go_to_harvard_if_its_hes/) | [Exhibit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/aixskc/hes_alb_acronym_history/)

I hope the distinction is clear from these examples. If not, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain further. 

---

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

JohnHarvardsLeftSock,"Delivered by President Faust at last year's convocation address:

>Many of the most important ideas you will encounter over the next four years will not come from a professor or a lab or a book or an online assignment. They will come from those sitting next to you right now. Many of the questions you come to ask, the challenges you learn to parry, the new perspectives you come to embrace will be the result of your interactions with one another. This is why it is imperative that your class collectively represent the widest possible range of backgrounds, and experiences, and interests, the broadest diversity of geographic origins, socioeconomic circumstances, ethnicity, race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, political perspective. It is possible, in 2017, to accumulate enough information and pass enough tests through online learning to get a college degree. But we have asked all of you to uproot your lives, move to Massachusetts with carloads filled with paraphernalia and teary-eyed families forced to bid you good-bye. Why do we do this? We do it because we believe in the power of community as an essential educational force. But that community must be constituted so that it does not simply present you with what you already know or with people whose life experiences and outlooks are just like yours. It is its diversity, its elements of unfamiliarity, its elements of difference that render Harvard College the extraordinary experience that I know you will find it to be. We are excited to welcome you, Class of 2021, because you are in yourselves a great educational machine — destined to teach one another — and, of course, teach us as well — because of the variety of who you are and what you bring. When the admissions office decided on you, it was because they wanted your voice, your contribution as part of this creative cacophony. So don’t be silent. (And please don’t live your life online as if you weren’t here at all!) Engage with one another. Talk a lot so others can learn from you. Listen even more so that you can learn from them. Don’t be afraid to take the risk of being wrong. Don’t be afraid to admit you are wrong. It is the best way to learn and grow. And listen generously to others so that they may take risks too. Use the community of your fellow students as one of the greatest gifts and opportunities of your time here. Help us to build at Harvard a model of how people can be enriched rather than divided by their differences.

As you look forward to the upcoming semester, what will you miss the most regarding our campus, student life, events, buildings and other such perks that come with in-person attendance?

Personally, I'm really going to miss events such as *Crimson Jam*, the student-only night at the Harvard Art Museum, various clubs, random events that pop up each semester on bulletin boards around campus and even picking up a copy of The Crimson (should I see one).

I'll definitely miss being able to study in Widener. That place has been a haven for my ability to focus - I'm so much more capable of working in there since it's so quiet and I have less distractions than home. That and it's a a gorgeous building. 

I also have little spots on campus I like to just sit at and read/study. The nook in the top of Sever's Film Library was amazing for that, as was parts of the Science Center.

But I will ***not*** miss dodging selfie sticks and having to find a way around tourists trying to figure out if they can go into X building or not.",What will you miss the most in Fall '20?

be_more_bmore,"Ok listen up freshmen, and underachieving upperclassmen. You came in wanting to concentrate in English, and thought ""thank god I am in college and dont have to take a math class anymore!"" Not so fast sucker! 

To graduate from this esteemed school you still need to fulfill every hist&lit kids worst nightmare, the QRD. But fear not, I have compiled a list of the easiest classes to skate through this distributional requirement.

&#x200B;

5. Econ 50:

Great intro class that requires basically no knowledge of econ, or math, or coding, or much of anything useful, and since you are a humanities kid thats probably right up your alley. 

4. Math 21b 

Linear algebra, really? It doesn't get much easier than this. y = mx +b, come on, that's baby shit. This is just like learning what lines are, the only tricky part is now they call them vectors––big whoop. 

3. Applied Math 22a

coming in at just 8 hours of work per week according to the Q guide this is like linear algebra but, like, applied, sounds easy to me. The prof uses the word ""gentle"" in the course description, it doesn't get much easier than that. 

2. Math 23a

So this one is like the baby linear algebra mentioned earlier but now there is some ""real analysis"" tacked on. Oh boy, I go day to day looking at real things, now you want me to analyze them? Cake walk!

1.Math 55a 

""Studies in algebra and group theory""?  Your biggest challenge in this course will be trying to remember the basic algebra you learned in like 6th grade. The group theory portion? The perfect prep for blocking groups. 

Some people claim this is the hardest math class in the country, but thats mostly hype so people dont figure out how easy this class is. I hear 100% of the 10% of kids who don't drop the class, get A's, so you are basically 100% guaranteed to get an A!

Yazars,"I'm curious to hear how Harvard alumni have chosen to maintain a relationship with Harvard after graduation, and what you've found most rewarding. Personally, I've wanted to maintain some type of connection, but life as an adult gets busy and complicated, and I often find that it gets bumped lower on the list of life's priorities.  I did alumni interviewing for some years, and found it rewarding to help out and to represent Harvard to applicants.  When I was back in the area, I reached out to a few student groups and did a few talks about the premed process.  I went to a few groups' meetings, but didn't keep that up.  I've been somewhat wary of official alumni association things, as my family's experiences with respect to spam, etc. has not been good.


I've thought about reaching out again to undergrads to pay forward some experience and see how I can help--even perhaps inconsequential stuff like bringing some people on a a Costco run for their suitemates--or informal advising, but am not sure how much anyone would want that kind of assistance or interaction.

All the comments are highly negative toward H for various reasons - too expensive, poor job outlook, heathens, etc. Many are validating the parents' beliefs that Harvard is just an overpriced version of the local community college.
  
There are a bunch of misinformed comments saying that the quality of education/learning is the same everywhere (which I disagree with coming from my non-H undergrad) and that Harvard will just lead to graduating with a lot of debt and no good jobs (there is a mom on this thread saying they know lots of Harvard grads who work at Starbucks with 6 figures of debt...)
  
Might be a little biased here, but I'm trying to balance out the incorrect info the kid may be hearing from home. We're both from a lower income, working class neighborhood so I don't think he has a lot of people who are familiar with higher ed. I'd hate to see a high potential kid not even apply due to poor info.
  
I don't have the best info on the College since I wasn't undergrad here, so I was wondering if anyone who would be willing to connect with him?

BigCrim8810,"Received at 9:20 pm, 9/12/19:

Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

All of us have been horrified by the revelations regarding Jeffrey Epstein, and I write today to update our community on steps we are taking in view of current information about his philanthropy to Harvard.

Let me start by emphasizing the obvious: Epstein’s reported criminal actions were utterly abhorrent. They flagrantly offend the values of our society and this institution, and we condemn them. We also recognize the profound pain that Epstein caused to his victims and their families, and we commend their courage in coming forward to bring his crimes to light.

Epstein’s connections as a donor to this University, and other institutions, raise important concerns. With that in mind, two weeks ago I asked for a review of his donations to Harvard. Our decentralization makes such a review more complicated than it would be at some other institutions. I want to emphasize that this review is ongoing. Our review to date indicates that between 1998 and 2007, Epstein made a number of gifts to support various faculty and institutional research activities across the University. The largest of these was a $6.5 million gift in 2003 to support the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics. The University received other gifts, which totaled approximately $2.4 million, based on current information. Each of these gifts from Epstein and his affiliated foundations to Harvard University predates his guilty plea in June 2008. To date, we have uncovered no gifts received from Epstein or his foundation following his guilty plea. Moreover, we specifically rejected a gift from Epstein following his conviction in 2008. We have also recently learned that Stephen Kosslyn, a former faculty member and a beneficiary of Epstein’s philanthropy, designated Epstein as a Visiting Fellow in the Department of Psychology in 2005. We are seeking to learn more about the nature of that appointment from Dr. Kosslyn, who no longer works at the University.

The majority of Epstein’s gifts were designated for current use, not as endowed funds, and nearly all were spent years ago for their intended purposes in support of research and education. Our ongoing review of these gifts has identified one current use fund and one small endowment designated to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with a total unspent balance of $186,000. After consultation with the Dean of the FAS, we have decided that the University will redirect the unspent resources to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault. This is an unusual step for the University, but we have decided it is the proper course of action under the circumstances of Epstein’s egregiously repugnant crimes. The issue of the gifts given to institutions by donors at Jeffrey Epstein’s suggestion, is also one that has emerged in recent days, and we are looking into this as part of our ongoing review.

Epstein’s behavior, not just at Harvard, but elsewhere, raises significant questions about how institutions like ours review and vet donors. I will be convening a group here at Harvard to review how we prevent these situations in the future. I also hope to engage our peer institutions to consider how we can collectively improve our processes. We can all learn from each other.

Let me end where I began. Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes were repulsive and reprehensible. I profoundly regret Harvard’s past association with him. Conduct such as his has no place in our society. We act today in recognition of that fact. And we do so knowing that the scourge of sexual assault continues to demand our close attention and concerted action.

Harvard is not perfect, but you have my commitment as president that we will always strive to be better.

Sincerely,
Lawrence S. Bacow

verisad,"throwaway. I know this sub gets tons of posts just like this, and right now is probably prime time as we’re all reeling from the semester and getting back long-anticipated grades. I’ve spent tons of time brooding these thoughts, and hesitating to post because we’ve all heard this story before, but idk man, I really want these feelings off my chest. Either way I really am sorry in advance for the ranty long post ahead.

It’s 11:22 pm on the 31st and I’m unironically sitting in my bed in my dead quiet house while the rest of the world is celebrating New Years’ Eve. It’s not that I didn’t want to party. I just didn’t get invited anywhere. It’s given me even more time to ruminate than was already unhealthy, and now all the bad thoughts are just melting together and really letting me have it.
 
My first semester kind of sucked. I know it wasn’t the worst it possibly could have been, but it sure wasn’t good. Now I know this is pretty normal, but so many things that were bad about it are part of broader problems, and I know they won’t just magically resolve themselves. I feel really angry lately, which is just an intensification of previous, constant feelings of sadness, emptiness, paranoia and self-blame that have stretched back since early in high school. When I have memories about the semester, if I close my eyes and re-envision my state of mind when I had time to think— on those routine walks to/from the dhall, to class, wherever— with minimal exception, I could only ever recall feeling angry, sad, or just nothing. It was constant by around the second week of classes. Feeling nothing but either distinctly bad, or just nothing. Just flat. And that flat feeling wasn’t much better than bad, because it would devolve into bad at the drop of a hat. The same didn’t go for good; something cool could happen, and I could feel relaxed for once, but the bad ruminations and mean inner criticisms would crowd out those feelings so quickly that I look back and hardly remember the good times even happened. By the end of the semester I felt like I was slowly losing my spirit. Just fading into something vaguer and vaguer every day. I felt like who I was there was just some even worse, even less likable version of whatever confused sad thing I was before.

My approach to these feelings this semester was mostly to isolate myself when I got into a really negative spiral, which ended up being pretty often after the first few weeks. I would avoid developing my friendships, not because I didn’t want to have friends, but because despite my efforts to cheer up, it was honestly really, really difficult to not appear cold and dismissive and terse in conversation even though none of that had a single thing to do with the other person. It’s not that I turned into an absolute asshat during those moods, or was explicitly mean, and it’s certainly not that I never talked to people. I really did have a some normal, good days, some great meals where I felt just fine and slipped back into my sort of funny, chill self. It’s just that I didn’t do it enough, and now I’m worried the withdrawn brooding side is all some people might remember. I could have done so much better. I just gave up and withdrew into myself too many times in the dhall or in classes or meetings with my EC. I could have done so much better. Not that I even know how to manage it, but I could have tried harder. I’m really concerned about the long-term effects of that behavior on my future ability to make friends here, because I’m paranoid that people have an image of me as this angry loner. Maybe kind of irrational, maybe not. I’m just angry at myself I let that side come out so often. We’re all people, we all get angry. Come on verisad, you’re supposed to develop methods to control yourself when you’re an adult. I’ve done a shit job with that. I shouldn’t have let it get this out of hand.

I’m just really disgusted with myself. I feel like that’s the best way I could describe it sometimes. Like when I kind of step outside myself, and look inward, I kind of cringe, because ew, look at me. I’m not performing particularly well at school (and know a few of my peers did consistently better, plus were good wholesome people, so the ‘it’s only first semester’ stuff is not really a tenable excuse), I have no friends, my jokes aren’t really that funny, I’m kind of weird and tryhard and awkward. Any people I met in the dhall, at my main EC, that I SHOULD have pursued friendships with, I either only half did, or just didn’t, because I guess I couldn’t deal with the effort of following it up, or just couldn’t reign in my emotions. I’ve even gained fifteen pounds, so when I’m not degrading myself in my head for whatever reason, no worries, I could always just look at my body and be fucking disgusted all over again. I came home thinking maybe being away from Annenberg would help me at least begin shedding the weight, slowly, since we generally don’t keep excess food in the house . . . nope, no change. And too bad the iota of motivation I actually did have to go work out in the beginning of the semester, when I got myself to the gym a few times, has totally burnt out.

I know we all have a mean inner critical voice and this is it talking. But the thing is, I feel like when we tend to say things like ‘don’t listen to the critical inner voice, because it’s irrational,’ my problem with that is that I feel like mine is, actually, pretty ‘rational’. I really do seem to deserve some, if not most, of the self-criticism. My personality is lacking somewhere. Not to make this about logic or anything, but it’s the inference to the best explanation. Take the real-life evidence, I don’t have friends. I’m not getting hit up. Never dated anyone. I’m a lonely person. I am capable of being outgoing and somewhat funny, but somewhere along the way the motor just burns out and somehow I can’t make and keep friends. I’m not extremely desirable friend or partner material, and I am doing this to myself, and am not getting better at not doing it to myself. 

I know it can change. Anything can change. It could get better, sure. Then it could get worse again. I told myself that things would change for the better in high school, and senior year — forget it, after Dec. 13th I thought I was holding that golden ticket, finally on my way to feeling ‘normal’ and fulfilled and with my own crowd. I remember the fever of the holidays. I binged the housing day videos when they came out, memorized all the flags and mascots. I watched that Adams rap video one in awe, feeling all fuzzy, like I was in on this special inside joke now. Well surprise, reversal of fortune, now who even knows if I’ll have a blocking group. I’ll have less than a month to figure it out. I just wish I gave it a little more effort. I couldn’t just suck it up and get back on the horse. That’s what life is about, getting back on the horse. And I couldn’t do it, and I don't know how to get better at doing it. I wish I could sorry to any person I was ever unfairly dismissive toward. I just want them to know how sorry I am, and that it wasn't their fault. It's also absolutely awful to consider the possibility that I could have contributed to even more bad feelings in others when I acted like that, and just continued the cycle and made it worse for everyone and helped screw over the aggregate pleasure, even if just a little. If anyone our there ever had someone just act mad around you for no reason, I'm sorry on their behalf. Maybe it was me. You didn't deserve that.

If anyone else had similar feelings first semester and wants to share any insight, I would really appreciate it. I'm currently talking to someone at CAMHS, and having some sort of evaluation soon where I guess they determine whether I should get on meds. That's kind of worrisome in its own right because my parents' divorce is leaving my mom in a really awful financial situation, and getting outside treatment is costly and I don't even want to think about stressing her out more, but we'll see. If anyone found other ways of coping that helped in the first year, it would mean a lot. 

I’m sorry this was a dump. If it’s too rambling, I’m sorry, delete it, or I will. I know it’s like anything else we all see and hear about here, but I seriously have nowhere else to put down these feelings. I hope everyone on this sub has a great New Years. You all work so hard and deserve the best. Whoever you are, I seriously hope you could find some solace from whatever you’re going through right now. I’m sure we could all use that right now.

depressedatharvard,"Hey guys, 

So, idk if this is the right spot for this, but here goes:

This is my first semester (I’m a first-year) and it’s been the most miserable few months of my life. Every day I’ve been here I’ve just been sad. I know I’m clinically depressed and all that stuff, but I’ve never been this bad to the point where–now that I’ve got to take finals–I just want to curl up and die somewhere. 


Socially, I had a group for a little bit but there was a bit of a falling out–it wasn’t really anyone’s fault, but it was enough for me to distance myself and so I lost any sense of social belonging earlier in the semester. In terms of clubs, it’s just been a steady stream of rejections. And in terms of academics, I push myself so damn hard and I still get really shitty grades and I’m probably going to just end up with all Cs and maybe a B if I’m lucky. I just feel really inadequate all the time and everyone is always talking about grade inflation and complains about their A- or whatever, meanwhile I’m literally at the bottom of all my classes and I kind of just want to die because of it. I did go to a kind of shitty public school where I didn’t have to try very hard in general, but I’ve always pushed myself and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to fix anything in any aspect of my life and it’s been so incredibly frustrating. My finals have all been ass, even though I’ve given up what little time I made for myself to throw myself 100% into preparing for them. 

I tried to convince myself that, at the very least I could do something fun or cool over the summer because Harvard’s name–no matter how much I hate this place and no matter how miserable I’ve been–is powerful enough to open doors. I realize now how misguided that was, because I’m on-track to go home and be depressed for 3 months over summer break and nothing else. Maybe pick up an odd job or two but nothing relevant to my goals. 

I don’t know who to go to for support. CAMHS gave me the option of antidepressants or weird fucking support groups, that I know wouldn’t help me. My parents think that Harvard is the best place on earth and that I’m silly to be so sad while I’m here. I don’t have friends really. I’m just so at my wit’s end. I know it’s only one semester and I’m probably just a whiny idiot for complaining this much, but I really can’t see any way out of this mess. I don’t know if I should consider transferring, and even if I did, I don’t know what school would take my shitty GPA and useless/non-existent extracurriculars. A part of me thought that maybe this was something to discuss with PAFs or my advisor, but it seems like PAFs are just there to cart in food for study breaks and advisors to lift the hold on your account. 

And, even if I do stay at this school, I don’t see how things would be different next semester or the one after that or the one after that. It’s clear that I’m not academically capable enough for this school and there doesn’t seem to be a way for me to fix that. I’m just over everything kind of at this point. Life, Harvard,  everything else. 

I’m on mobile and I have fat fucking fingers so I apologize for any grammatical errors. 

I’d appreciate any advice or something. I don’t know.

be_more_bmore,"As I stood in the mirror last night and admitted to myself that I wanted to declare econ I mentally prepared myself for the onslaught that living my truth as a lover of economics would entail. 

I first want to say that declaring econ is not a choice, I didn't wake up one day and decide ""I want to pick the most popular concentration that offers some of the most lucrative job opportunities after graduation"",  I woke up one morning clutching a copy of Wealth of Nations and blabbering to my roommate about reverse causality. 

To some of you it may seem like I am equating the struggle of being an ec concentrator with that of LGBTQ Americans, and you would be right, that's exactly what I am doing (because this is satire). Some would say that the backlash ec conentators face is actually more nefarious than regular-ol homophobia; I think much of the hatred of econ is based in the view that it is twinged with pre-professionalism and that students in the field  have merely forgone Harvard's fantastic academic opportunities to study something that will get them a job at Goldman. Regardless of whether or not that is true, the notion that Harvard students should not focus on finding a job and making money post grad has undertones of a quiet privilege, deaf to students from economically insecure backgrounds who do not feel they have the luxury of entering the job market without classically marketable job skills, and inconsiderate of other colleges and universities that serve merely as engines of economic mobility and not academic playgrounds. 

This is not to say that every hist and lit concentrator is some trust fund baby and every econ concentrator is a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who wants to work in investment banking to support his or her family, far from it, this is merely to say we would be remiss if we did not examine the ways in which class, privilege, and economic security permeate our decisions to come to Harvard and how we decide to spend our time while we are here.

chabafred,"(TLDR at the bottom) Hi I’m was recently accepted REA to Harvard, but I’m actually pretty worried about attending the school. I don’t want to be rude or call anyone out, but I’m afraid of Harvard’s social sphere. A fair share of posts in this subreddit are about how lonely and sad Harvard students feel, the lack of a dating life, and so on. This just kinda worries me a bit. I kinda hoped getting into Harvard was like this golden ticket and life would be all butterflies and rainbows after I started college. Obviously, this was super naive, but now it seems like it might even be the opposite. I already struggle with sadness and loneliness right now and I’d hate for college to amplify them. 

I’m already somewhat introverted. In high school, I finally made some solid friends, but it took until senior year for me to find them.  I’m afraid that finding friends at Harvard might take too long. I wish I thought of this earlier because by now it’s too late to apply to other schools, specifically MIT. MIT seems like it might be a better fit for me (I want to study comp sci and am pretty nerdy in liking engineering), but the all-nighter horror stories and my annoying mit tour guide scared me away from applying, which I now sincerely regret. MIT seems to have a ton of sciencey, nerdy people that I get along well with. So far all the Harvard people I met are super into social justice, liberal arts, and debating, which is fine and cool, but not really the kind of people I associate with.

Also, a minor point about the people, everyone seems to be way more accomplished than me by just looking at their Instagram pages. Imposter syndrome is already coming in hot :(

Finally, sports are a minor issue I have about Harvard. I was hoping to play my sport at Harvard, but even if I could play, the D1 level of athletics seems very hard core and I don’t know if I could handle it, if even afforded the opportunity. I am aware of club options, but I don’t know much about it. 

I should also state that I am still almost certainly coming to Harvard. I didn’t really apply to any school that I would choose over Harvard. I really just want to know how I can make sure the social life goes well for me. I realize that it might be early to start worrying about this since I haven’t even been at Harvard for one day, but I’d rather be prepared for the worst. Thanks

TLDR: I am going to Harvard in the fall, but I’m afraid that a sciencey introvert like me will have trouble making friends, dating, and not getting depressed. It might be early to worry about this, but I’d like to know about all I can in advance. Any advice on how to avoid that would be super appreciated.",How to be happy at Harvard,32,0.92,ej6w8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/ej6w8z/how_to_be_happy_at_harvard/,29,1578039047.0,2020-01-03 02:10:47

Our three primary goals are to improve transparency and communication, build community, and identify needs and innovate solutions. We share health education material, resources for students, and opportunities to serve our greater community through our[ resources spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTerz_XiSYghoEMn01biDnqqBM_pQIa3S8o-BhEKy-s/edit#gid=531738015) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studentsvspandemics/), write policy memos for state legislators, organize virtual COVID hackathons, address the digital disparity, and launch other initiatives. SvP gained over 100 volunteer members within a week of its launch and is now there are over 370 members from different chapters all over the country (more chapters oversea are being built!)

Using a throwaway account because I'm usually more of a lurker on reddit than a poster. 

Now that 6 grad schools are officially going online for the Fall international students have been advised to not move to the US until in-person classes restart.

I'm now trying to decide between deferring for a year when it's unlikely that I'll get a new job (for context my contract ran out and wasn't renewed because of covid) or starting online and hoping that I'll be able to move for the Spring semester (which obviously can't be guaranteed to be in person).

The thing is, I’m lined up to start working in finance with a top bank in NYC once I graduate, and I signed the full time offer several months ago. If I work at this finance job I won’t have the time to take on the acting role. And it’s likely I won’t have such a great opportunity again once I start working in the industry. Should I give up a good (safe) job or should I pursue my dreams? I’m struggling to make a choice here because money has always been important and if I take the acting role there’s no guarantee I’ll even have a career there.

hgsegrad2019,"Hi all, I'm a recent grad of the Harvard Graduate School of Education TIE program and wanted to share a few thoughts here. I haven't seen many reviews  online and thought it would be good for anyone considering the program to learn about my experiences before they get involved. Of course this is my opinion and others may disagree.

The Technology, Innovation and Education program is a one year master of education degree that overall specializes in the application of technology into education. You are required to take 5 classes that fulfill TIE credits and can use the remaining credits anywhere on campus or via cross registration at other schools. The TIE credit classes at the School of Education are meant to be applicable to many different careers whether they be designing educational programs, developing new education products, starting a business in education, bringing more technology into the classroom etc. You can find most of this information online and I wanted to share some of the pros and cons of the program here.

Pros:

1. Hands down the best part of the program is the cohort of other students you work with. Our cohort was about 70 people who represented lots of different backgrounds. Off the top of my head there were successful entrepreneurs, classroom teachers, programmers, business consultants, political activists, project managers, medical professionals and more. There were not a lot of people straight out of undergrad and the majority had some kind of education related experience. All of them were very inspiring, really personable and I felt really honored to be with them.
2. Being on the Harvard campus is incredible. You are open to just about everything going on at all the schools on campus and I felt it was really easy to meet people across many different programs through extracurriculars and other activities. MIT and Tufts are open to you as well if you feel like heading to another campus! Lots of competitions, classes, talks, meet ups, sporting events and that's not even considering the other things Boston offers.
3. The faculty are great. I really liked my adviser and the professors at HGSE. Across the other campus schools people are really responsive to meet as well. So long as you're a student on campus you have access to just about anyone.

Cons

1. One year is really, really short. If you are looking to enter the education industry but are not sure of the kind of role you are looking for your job search at the end might be difficult. Two semesters really isn't long enough to develop a solid set of new skills or to try out a lot of new things in the process. If you have a very clear vision (i.e. I want to start a company or I want to transition to a project manager in education) you will absolutely have the resources available to at least learn enough to secure an entry level role somewhere perhaps with the help of an adviser or professor. The classes alone aren't a feeder into any particular role and you will need to guide all of this yourself. In my opinion, the classes weren't particularly rigorous especially when compared with the core curriculum at some of the other graduate schools.
2. The career service office is completely overloaded and are not a lot of help. I don't know of anyone that took a job from the internal job board and the coaching sessions there are limited to 20 minutes at a time. The job fairs/employment seminars were honestly a little disappointing as some of the more well known education players either weren't present, weren't hiring at the event or clearly weren't serous about recruiting there (the scholastic people didn't even bring paper to write down interested candidates information!). Also the bigger companies that visited campus such as Microsoft made clear that they would not be accepting resumes and were only there to share their experiences in education. There are career resources present at HGSE through unofficial channels like advisers, colleagues, seminars and professors but don't expect the school itself to present many opportunities.
3. Alumni support is not as good as other graduate schools on campus. You can join the Harvard alumni network however there isn't really much in terms of alumni meet ups/reunions that the other graduate schools on campus have. 
4. As everyone already know the price tag is steep. Living in Boston is much more expensive than it used to be as well.

My Recommendations

I think this program is best suited for the following kinds of people:

1. You can get some kind of scholarship and get a leg up in classroom teaching opportunities. I personally don't think that the price of the program justifies the amount of ""leg up"" you get in teaching.
2. You are serious about starting a business in education and want to make use of all the entrepreneurship resources there.
3. Your company/school/organization will pay for this somehow or you will work in your original employer with some sort of bonus at the end of the program. 9 months is possible for some employers to work with and you can do the program part time over 2 years however I don't think there are many spots available for this.
4. You have a very defined transition into another career. Your first semester will be spent figuring out life at Harvard and your second semester will be all about finding a job. There is not a lot of time to test things out and see what you like. This is quite similar to other students I spoke to at MIT and the Kennedy school doing one year programs as you really don't have enough time to experience things like at 4 years of undergrad. Decide what you want to do in October at the latest and get as many skills and contacts in that industry/company as possible.
5. You already have a core skill i.e. programming, data analysis, financial modeling, graphic design etc. and want to transition into education. You can gain credibility in education within two semesters but don't have the time to master a ""hard skill."" The technology classes there coupled with a lot of outside resources can help but it will be a very busy year for you and will sacrifice a lot of the ""Harvard experience"" to do this. The motto on campus is that your fifth class every semester is ""Harvard"" due to the amount of activity on campus throughout the year.
6. The students who found work afterwards were typically doing roles such as curriculum designer, learning designer, community partnerships manager, non profit coordinators, education researchers and teachers. A few people went back to their original jobs in some form and a quite a few others are still looking for work a few months after graduation. 

Ultimately the consensus I've seen from alumni and colleagues is that it is a really enjoyable experience but may not be the most effective use of time and money unless you fit the above categories. Like many other roles in this day and age if you are really passionate about entering a certain profession there are many other ways of doing it rather than getting another degree.

thedietitian,"There's a group of sororities and fraternities suing Harvard for their supposedly unconstitutional sanction policies. Let's discuss.

**Questions for Discussion**

(1) Do you believe the admissions lawsuit has emboldened students and other organizations to sue Harvard?

(2) Who's right in this debate? Should Harvard have the right to set its own policies because they're a private institution? Does the sanctions policy violate the constitutionality of freedom of association? 

**My Thoughts**

(1) Harvard doesn't ban students from joining single-gender social organizations, but they won't endorse you for leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and endorsement for prestigious scholarships. I'm not a lawyer, but I suppose a good defense would be that students technically do still have the freedom to associate. They just don't have the college's institutional backing.

(2) Somehow, the feminist argument doesn't sit right with me. I don't feel that *not* being a part of a women's group would forbid you from embracing womanhood and celebrating sisterhood. I feel like you can do that beyond the realm of a sorority.

Huge-Sell,"I just started using reddit, so I'm not sure if this will break the subreddit rules. I'm just committed to the Class of 2024 a few days ago, and I was hoping I could start some discussion regarding the overall waitlist usage of top schools. 

With everything going on, I completely understand any guesses at this point are pure speculation. But, I suspect some of you are substantially more informed on this than me. I know Harvard accepted 30 more people this year (1980) to maybe account for any covid-19 related deferrals or offer refusals. My question is how much will those 30 more admitted students affect the usage of the waitlist this year. 

Last year, 65 people were accepted off the waitlist. Any chance that number will be higher this year. And if so, how much so? Something interesting to note is that school who historically haven't utilized waitlist at all like Princeton and Dartmouth started to pull from the waitlist before May 1. And, UPenn dean of admissions openly announced, a few days after ivy day, that he predicted they would heavily use the waitlist this year. Granted, these schools don't have the yield Harvard has historically had, but its still weird how they resorted to the waitlist that early when they haven't admitted anyone off it in years past.

Now I am extremely discouraged about going to Harvard. I tried reading posts and watching Harvard vloggers (like John Fish and YesReneau who unfortunately discouraged me even more) to get more of a positive feel about the school, but mostly I heard that the atmosphere is really cutthroat, it is hard to explore new clubs due to its selectivity, the food is bad,  the professors are disengaging, it is extremely stressful, grade inflation sucks @ Harvard, the curriculum/opportunities not as great for STEM students as they seem etc.

Honestly, the more I look into all of these perceptions about Harvard, the more scared I get. After being accepted, I made the poor decision of only applying to 2 other schools (which happen to be highly selective) and the other school I was accepted to is offering me a financial aid package that my family can't afford in comparison to Harvard's FA)

mcoolinham,"I saw another post on here about someone asking the same thing; so I’ll just highlight the things to which I wasn’t able to get an answer from that post. 

I’m certainly going into CS, and ik that MIT is probably better but I don’t know if I’ll vibe with the overly nerdy culture of MIT. Harvard’s social scene seems to be more of my taste.

Harvard PROs: 

- social atmosphere

- grade inflation/ higher avg gpa(i might want to go onto business school later on + Harvard likely has more connections)

- it’s harvard (world wide prestige — kind of a dream school for me)

Harvard cons: 

- their cs department isn’t on the same level as MIT

- maybe less opportunities for cs internships, since Harvard seems to be leaning more liberal arts

MIT PROS: 

-strong cs dept

- collaborative culture

MIT CONS: 

- too geeky/nerdy 

- difficult (lower avg gpa)

- maybe more competitive for CS internships since like 1/2 the people major in CS

I’ve heard cross registering is a thing, but it is logistically difficult and takes a decent amount of time to commute back and forth. Also, I’m assuming you can only really cross register for a few classes — if I were to do Harvard to MIT

I think the housing system in both places is fine for me.

I recently got into Harvard and Yale. I can't go to any admit days because of the current global health situation. I would appreciate it if you could allow me to gain a better insight into your institution. (I'm from Dallas, TX if that makes any difference lol).

I intend to do bioengineering/biomedical engineering on a pre-med track and go to medical school after graduation. I want a school with good pre-med experience and generally good advising. I want to be heavily involved in research during undergrad, and I want to be able to form connections with my professors. I just want a campus with friendly faces, with a lot of clubs I can become involved in.

I'm also interested in film and art as hobbies and I have a wide array of interests I'd like to pursue in college. I love to write and that's also something I'd like to do (i.e. I'd like to perhaps get involved at a school publication). I want a school that would allow me to pursue these hobbies as well as allow me to build a solid pre-professional experience.

I really want to know what Harvard's environment is like. Do you feel it is as cutthroat and competitive as many say it is? If someone looks lost on campus, will someone typically approach them to help? Are people friendly? I would appreciate your honest opinions!

montym,"Hello friends,

Harvard's history is marked with numerous occasions when crisis lead to momentous change for the University's constituent schools. The most notable of these events for the purpose of my post is how Radcliffe Women began attending lectures with men only when male attendance dropped during the Second World War. Now is such a moment for the Extension School. 

Once we have contained or survived the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus (and we will survive), all members of the Harvard community should note how much of a resource the Extension School is for the entire university. Not only has it be tacitly (and intently) preparing for widespread distance education for generations, it also provides the University with insight and a diversity of perspectives the University would not have otherwise. 

Furthermore, HES reaches some of the poorest, and most disadvantaged people affiliated with the University. Presidents Faust and Bacow have discussed how Harvard needs to use its ""greatness"" to do more ""good"". Well... HES has been at the forefront of this goal since 1909.

While most people in r/Harvard may demand for the ""In Extension Studies"" tag to be removed from diplomas, I suggest 3 other reforms that will integrate HES more with the broader Harvard community.

1) Open University Apartment Housing up to HES degree students, at least undergrads. Students in Columbia's undergraduate parallel to HES, the School of General Studies (GS), are allowed to enter the housing lottery for their version of University Apartment Housing.

2) Allow HES degree candidates to enroll directly for all FAS classes (prerequisites permitting). Again, Columbia already does this which results in more veterans, mothers, minorities, and professional artists in their classes.

3) Seek donations for (or just build with the \~$40B endowment) a ""House"" for extension programs. This house can rent out rooms to students visiting for on-campus weekends, or to full time students taking all their courses on-campus. It also would give the Extension School a more visible presence on campus, and a new permanent home for a revived Grossman Library. (As an urban planner, I think the Church St. parking lot would be a great place for an ""Extension House"".)

I hope some of you agree with this assessment. Harvard's response to the coronavirus opens a door for HES to ascend to a place within the University it already should hold. I encourage everyone to email the school, the University, and any professor they know to highlight the importance of the Extension School for the entire University. The coronavirus may linger, but it will become old news as quickly as it became a pandemic. Its legacy must be used to improve the University, and one way this can be accomplished is to support the Extension School, and its degree students as much as any other degree candidate.",A Pivotal Moment for the Extension School,23,0.87,fhi4x4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/fhi4x4/a_pivotal_moment_for_the_extension_school/,4,1584055982.0,2020-03-12 18:33:02
be_more_bmore,"Ok so I missed lunch on Thursday so I go over to CVS before heading to class. I bought Soylent and a chocolate chunk cliff bar. As I am walking from to Sever I hear a guy behind me say ""help a veteran get something to eat."" I turn around and I see a middle aged black gentleman in a wheelchair. 

I pull the Cliff bar out of my pocket and I asked him, ""Hey man I just bought this, do you want it?"" 

He looks at the bar and asks, ""Is it gluten free?"" 

I start looking at the back of the package and say ""I dunno man, I don't think so."" 

He, casually replies, ""Don't worry about it then."" 

I can't stop thinking about this interaction, so much about it was so weird. If I was homeless and asking for food I would definitely say that I had celiac's or gluten sensitivity for turning the food down. He didn't, is no gluten a preference for him? Does he have a gluten allergy? Is he in cahoots with the ""homeless vegetarian"" woman in front of CVS? 

I fully acknowledge that this man is a human being and has the absolute right to turn down my food if he doesn't want it. That being said, it was really disarming to try and give food to this go and be told no. More so, the way he told me no was so condescending.

veritaffling,"So I just read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5n409y/an_honest_assessment_of_my_time_at_harvard/) about someone's Harvard experience and felt compelled to write my own version--not to discount any of it, but because my time there was honestly the best of my life even when it was truly awful, and I miss it every day since graduating in May.

For context: I grew up in the Northeast in a middle class family--pretty low-income by Harvard standards, but above average in general. Despite being on significant financial aid (basically the most you can get without being on full scholarship), for the duration of my time in college I had to work 15-20 hours per week to cover my tuition. Occasionally I was envious of my better-off friends who had dozens of extra hours per week with which to do whatever they liked, but I loved my job and was honestly so excited the whole time about being at Harvard that I never resented it.

I couldn't disagree more with the above post regarding the academic experience. Due in part to my job and in part to the fact that I poured my heart and soul and time and effort into extracurricular organizations rather than studying, I performed incredibly poorly in my classes--like really, really poorly, to the point of nearly being asked to take leave. My biggest regret from my time in college is not taking better advantage of the academic resources, ESPECIALLY the professors. The few in whose classes I did well enough not to be ashamed to reach out to them are some of the most brilliant people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting, and I can only recall a couple of classes I actually thought were poorly taught (both math classes, for what that's worth).

The social dynamic was also completely different, in my experience. Yes, exclusivity is huge (and hugely annoying) at Harvard, and the final clubs are a thing, but I hardly ever interacted with them. I lucked into amazing roommates my freshman year who dragged me--a depressed, suicidal, failing-all-my-classes-why-did-they-even-admit-me mess at the time--through my freshman spring and remain my best friends to this day, but I'm still close with the friends I made through my job and through the organizations I joined, as well. Every group with which I even interacted--even those, frankly, in which I had minimal interest--welcomed me with open arms, and at no point did I feel like people were on the whole cold or uncaring. The Harvard community is real, and it is vibrant and funny and warm and wonderful if you push aside the <10% of the population that lives for the supposed superiority of final club participation.*

*Sorry, I don't really like final clubs, but that's its own discussion.

I've never felt like I can't be proud of where I went to school or that people resent me for it. My coworkers definitely rag on me and I'm still occasionally called ""Harvard,"" but it's in an affectionate, banter-y sort of way. I'm proud of Harvard and adore it as an institution, but I don't think having attended makes me better than anyone else and I think it can be and often is incredibly flawed; the same can be said of its affiliates. People don't hate people who went to Harvard; people hate assholes, and it so happens that these sets of people do sometimes overlap. When someone asks where I went to school, I tell them. Occasionally I'll get a ""well well WELL"" or something else in that joking vein; otherwise it's an ""oh cool"" or something. Either way, we both get on with our lives shortly after.

Harvard is an amazing place. It takes everything you've got, but it gives back in spades. As I settle into ""adult life"" (whatever that means, since I'm still wildly unclear), I find myself often missing the vibrance of its environment--the amazing people, the overwhelming opportunity, the boundless energy. Life has evened out a lot for me since graduation (I definitely feel more stable overall), but I look back fondly on the emotional volatility of going to school at a place like Harvard. It was incredibly hard at times and really put me through the ringer in a number of different ways, but in retrospect, to me, every second was worth it.

hugomyasshole,"I don't think I've ever done this terribly in school before. Coming into college, I wasn't grade-obsessed. My primary objective was to get my hands on all the possible opportunities available to me and I did. I understood there was still a balance to be maintained and I overstretched my limits. 

But I worked hard. I wanted to accomplish useful things in my clubs, organizations, and studies all at once. It was sort of a delicate game, where too much pressure from one side could collapse the entire structure. But I thought I mastered the art of keeping everything under control.

THEN...came the shitstorm of fails and trouble. I did horribly on a paper because I was too busy finishing a club project. Did pretty terribly on other assessments. 

And now my grades are shit. As hard as I try, it's never enough. I feel pretty shitty about myself and wish that the damage wasn't as big as it turned out to be.

supportsociology,"Hi Harvard Community,

I don't know how many of you are interested in Brazil, but the country has seen some quite conspicuous attacks on democracy recently, particularly on the education system. The government is planning to decentralize resources to social sciences and humanities - especially philosophy and sociology. Last week, the Ministry of Education announced that it would cut 30% of all federal universities' budgets. These are the leading research institutions in the country.

In response, a colleague and I in the department of sociology at Harvard wrote a letter in support of Brazilian sociology. In one week, we reached more than 10000 signatures from academics and other people who care about education across the globe, from countries like Brazil, Mexico, England, Zambia, Argentina, Lesotho, Japan, Israel, South Africa, and many, many others.

We, the organizers, and a professor in the department gave an interview to the Crimson last week. We explain the letter's goals and a little about what has been going on in Brazil.

ThrowawayOfCourse102,"Current '16 here, close to graduating. Hopefully, some Harvard students visit this sub.

Basically, I feel like I completely screwed up my Harvard experience. I don't love my blocking group and never found another core group of friends. I really regret the concentration I chose (think STEM, SEAS) and wish I had studied something relatively ""easier,"" a major that I could've grasped better. I've struggled so much that I couldn't tell you anything I actually learned at this point; I went through the motions and just tried my best on the psets by working with other people, and almost never did well on tests. I absolutely hate myself for getting the GPA I did; if I do very well this semester, I'll graduate with a 3.3, which by Harvard standards is pretty shitty (correct me if I'm wrong). It's frustrating because whenever I try to open up to people (mainly my blocking group, I guess), they dismiss me for various reasons. My GPA is a very real concern since I may consider an MBA, so I feel like I really fucked up. I just feel very dumb and incompetent here and it seems that everyone else at this point has it all together.

There's so much to be grateful for, which also makes it conflicting. I'm thankful for Harvard financial aid, esp. as a low-income student. I went through OCI and somehow got a job – I definitely don't think I'd be in the position I'm in without Harvard.

But overall, I've always felt very unhappy here. In retrospect, I should've sought out mental health services but with two months left, I don't know how effective it'd be.

SnooOranges423," 

It's the only Extension school that offers degrees. Extension school is misleading and for those of us who have degrees, people think we are in the same pool as those who have taken one online course some random time period ago.

Less than 1% of extension students even obtain a degree from HES. It devalues our diploma when the public thinks we took a few online courses.

Columbia changed theirs to Professional Studies and it worked out great for them. I understand that Harvard doesn't want to equate our degrees with other schools but we also deserve recognition for completing the degree given the difficulty in obtaining the degree and finishing an independent research thesis.

If you are a student or alumni reading this, please form a coalition or group. Reach out to professors for support. Email your Deans.

3) party scene for freshman? Is it usually within suites or at frats?

4) things u wish u could change about the school

5) how long do boston winters last? And when do they begin to become bearable?

6) do suites w around 4 people have their own bathroom? Or is it connected to another adjacent suite? If so, are they of the same gender?

7) how does housing work? Do u rank it? And roommates are randomly assigned?

8) is harvard confessions a vocal minority or a general reflection of the student body's feelings?

For the last few years, this house has counted as an investment property, because of which its net worth was taken into account as an asset and my financial aid packages have always been much lower than if just income were taken into account. 

Now my question is- since this house will no longer count as rented real estate, will its value still be considered while deciding aid? Is it worth requesting a reconsideration with the hope that I get a more affordable fin aid package?",Does the value of the primary home affect financial aid decisions?,20,0.92,i1qhmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/i1qhmw/does_the_value_of_the_primary_home_affect/,5,1596308720.0,2020-08-01 14:05:20

throwawayharvardd,"Hi everyone, I'm a student at the college. I'm black and I consider myself pretty socially activist, but after reading about and watching the video of the arrest on Yardfest night, I'm not entirely convinced it was police brutality. I want to emphasize that I **want** to learn why it was. A lot of my friends who are activists like me seem outraged, and I'm legitimately scared to ask them why. I feel obligated to feel outraged lmao.

So if I understand it correctly, a black student took hallucinogenic drugs (which I don't consider wrong if taken responsibly), threw his clothes on a woman and walked around naked on Mass ave. Police tackled him after talking to him, and a cop repeatedly punched him while on the ground. 

It's not clear from the video how much of a threat he might have posed to the officers. When I say threat, I don't mean something life-threatening; he was unarmed, weaponless, clearly not capable of endangering the officers' lives. I really mean the possible threat of simply hurting the cops. Cops will take any person down if they attempt to engage in any physical altercation with the cops, and rightfully so. A cop puts his life out there to protect the public (at least that's the goal), and they can never be certain when they might be hurt on the job. And second, I'm not sure of a better way to remove a naked man on some powerful drugs from the public. It doesn't seem like holding his hand and escorting him away was really an option. 

Under those conditions, I find it completely reasonable that they tackled him, but I'm not entirely sure about the repeated punching on the ground. I'm leaning towards believing that the punching might have been excessive force, but tbh, it's not clear from the video how much force it took to restrain him. Was he resisting heavily? Was he attempting to fight back while on the ground? These things just aren't clear from the video. In addition, the effects of certain drugs can make a person difficult to keep down. 

And what would've happened if he were white? I'm pretty sure police would tackle a naked white dude roaming the streets on some drugs. Like this is not some traffic stop kind of stuff, this is a nude guy roaming the streets acting a little crazy. Law enforcement wouldn't allow for that, and tackling seems like the method they would use for any adult man of any race. 

Now I really feel bad for the student. He messed up big time. Smart guy from Ghana doing math. But is that enough to excuse him? Like I feel so bad for him but cops would have done that to any person. 

Idk, enlighten me people. I think police brutality is one of America's biggest issues, and being from the South, I've faced my fair share of profiling from cops. I just really don't think this exemplifies police brutality though.",Why exactly was the arrest on Yardfest night a case of police brutality?,19,0.89,8djzhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/8djzhy/why_exactly_was_the_arrest_on_yardfest_night_a/,9,1524217059.0,2018-04-20 04:37:39
anincomingsophomore,"Today I fucked up. I made an inane decision. I wasn't ready for my midterm so I skipped it. I really hate myself for it. Before the midterm, I embarrassed myself and I sent a long email to my TF and I told him that I was depressed (which is true & documented). I'm like three weeks behind in school. I've barely read the textbook. Whenever I read the words, I can't focus. I don't have any concern or motivation. I don't do anything productive anymore. I also mentioned that I was seeing someone and I could obtain documentation from a professional. 

He didn't answer the question as to whether I could reschedule the exam, but he did say that I could take the class pass/fail so there'd be leeway in my grading. However, I don't want to do that. I want to be judged and evaluated just like everyone else. I'm here to learn, not to achieve the bare minimum in a class. Also, the subject matter pertains to my career interest. Especially because we have to write a detailed research paper as well. It feels good to get an A. I know I can do better in school. I just wanted a second chance.

I guess I want to ask, under what circumstances is bragging socially acceptable, and when is it just bragging?

My initial crack at this was, it's fine to post about something you're *doing*, like a fellowship you're actually taking or a program you're actually enrolling in, but it's weird to post about something you're *getting*, like awards or *admittances* to fellowships/PhD programs. The latter conveys information about your own plans, and the latter doesn't. Moreover, the latter sort of reveals that you're viewing these not as opportunities for how to spend your time but as validation that you're worthy (or, I suspect, better than the other applicants/your peers).

So, I’m a Harvard class of ‘24 member who’s close friends with someone who worked with THE prefrosh on the project that’s been blowing up these past few days, and it occurred to me that I’ll be spending the next four years alongside him. There’s no doubt that I’ll be uncomfortable the entire time, and I plan to go into relatively the same field, which means I’ll probably be in many of the same classes and perhaps student organizations. I’ve been considering deferring a year to avoid feeling anxious the entire time, but I know how crazy it sounds to take a year off to avoid being in the same class as a particular person. Would deferring a year largely because of this be ridiculous of a move? (Side note: I’m happy with the prospect of a gap year and will definitely find meaningful things to do with my time.

Manowich,"Hello all!

I was recently looking into Harvard University's Extension School and after chatting with one of the school's academic advisors, I still came away with a few questions that perhaps some of you may have the answers to. I suppose the easiest way to do this is to bullet-point them, so here goes...

&#x200B;

* For the ""Earn-Your-Way-In"" admissions, I was thinking of taking the three suggested courses that are on the Extension School's website (EXPO 15, EXPO 25, and MATH E-3). The advisor I spoke to mentioned that they would count towards the degree itself. Any thoughts on this? How were the courses themselves?
* I noticed that there's an on-campus requirement. How was this for folks? Was it a pain trying to find parking/getting a parking pass from the university? (I live about an hour north of Cambridge in Maine)
* How were the online classes/courses? I'm no stranger to online learning, but I do know that every school has their own ""spin"" when it comes to online education.
* How's financial aid for the Extension School? I noticed that it was mentioned online, and briefly said by the advisor I spoke with, but is it generous (if needed, I would only be taking sixty-four credits for the degree, as I will have sixty-four credits transferring into the program itself; also, I currently have a 3.67 GPA, if that goes into academic scholarship decision-making).
* And lastly, for those of whom who have graduated from this program, is it worth it? I've read other comment sections/blogs/posts where some have had difficulties with their degrees, due to the phrasing of the degree itself (""Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies,"" even though they majored/concentrated in Environmental Studies), and was just wondering if there was any sort of ""stigma"" attached to the degree, or if the majority of what I read was just a bunch of hot air.

&#x200B;

I know I need to get out of my comfort zone, because eventually, everyone's going to form a core group of friends, and those groups are typically hard to break into.

Back home, I went for years with what I'd only consider acquaintances. It wasn't until the past year or so until I started making real friends. Some of them I met online, and we talk to each other daily or weekly. I didn't form my first friendships in real life until this past summer. I have two friends, both of whom are 5 to 10 years than me. Quite frankly, that's the extent of my social life, and I'm satisfied with it.

I'm a recent 2024 admit torn between Harvard and Stanford for CS. A pull for H seems to be its overall intellectual development with the breadth of studies and diversity of student interests.

I'm wondering whether the gen-eds, freshman seminars, and divisional distributions actually end up contributing to intellectual development and whether they really teach you how to think. Or are they mostly BS? Do they just become a burden in the way of your concentration courses? Do you find value in taking them and being surrounded by students with many different interests?

MillionaireWaltz-,"I'm a 25 year old student in the home stretch of earning my Bachelor's from the University's Extension School - I've got a year and a half to go, at this point. I've been on-campus for all but the first 3 of my courses and I plan on keeping it that way. But something has always irked me a tad.

To start, though - I'll state a little about my background. I graduated high school early in Arizona, as I'd wanted to attend college full time. I'd always had a passion for studying and adhered to principles of self-teaching. I'd always wanted to go to a school I could be proud of and after earning my Associate's before moving to Washington, I'd hoped to achieve my goal of actually making it to a great school. Long story short, after helping run a successful business with my mother/sister, I chose to find a way to get into Harvard. Mostly because of its resources, storied history (I do love history, after all), professors I'd long idolized and I also fell in love with Cambridge. So, I applied, got all A's in my first 3 classes and was accepted.

Since then, I've done my best to make this campus my college home. I've spent so much time in the libraries, study halls, a few clubs and any event I could attend in between my 3-4 classes per semester and work. I've connected with students from the College, GSAS, HBS, HGSE, etc.

However, I've always been peeved by a lot of the semantics surrounding this particular school under the University - mainly, the notions of being ""lesser than"". And despite the fact that I have a 3.7 GPA which should make feel like a decent student and that I've somehow managed to be a Harvard student...I sometimes feel like a 'fake', if that makes any sense.

I know that this is likely a feeling echoed by many in every school on campus, of all ages and walks of life. But I digress.

What I was told and how I viewed the HUES is that it's just another one of Harvard's 12 degree-granting schools. It's not Harvard College and I wouldn't want it to be. It has an unconventional manner of admissions - but it's a marathon - many can enter the race but few can finish.

But I'd want HUES to be HC no more than I'd want the FAS to be GSAS. To me, it's a reverse admissions type deal, getting into Harvard this way. I didn't do this traditionally and I like it that way.

I've attended clubs and I work in the area. Never have I received any less respect or been the brunt of any form of pecking order burden. People have always seemed to treat me as just another student.

But a lot of the discussions on here and on blogs is...murky, to say the least. Along the lines of ""Yes, you're a Harvard student butttttt you're not really a student of the University, sorry"". And it...kind of sticks with you to read that sort of thing. Like you don't belong anywhere, really.

And there's a lot of things that makes me feel so much like a walking controversy. Like my presence as a student and my status is a bone of contention and debate.

Arguments like how some believe writing ""Harvard University - \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in Extension Studies"" is somehow misleading (?) even though by Harvard's guidelines it's the correct way to list your degree, how you need to have almost an asterisk on your accomplishments in discussion, etc. - all leads me to wonder if I made a wrong choice. My quality of education doesn't make me feel that way. But identity is important to one's feeling of self, too.

While I understand that someone who takes a course here isn't a ""Harvard student"" and some like to say they are (which is absolutely ridiculous), I'd like to be okay with saying that I am. But some days...I'm not.

Because I just want to feel like I have a home, here.

I really just want to feel like I belong, if that makes sense. That what I'm doing IS worth it. I'd be upset if I felt odd calling myself a University of Arizona student...if I was a student there and held an ID. It's the same issue, here.

Sometimes I feel like if I'd known my inevitable uneasiness about whether or not I'm actually a student of the university I'm attending, I may have chosen somewhere else.

Everyone always has said in passing and on campus that this is just another one of Harvard's 12 schools that grants degrees, albeit one that admits differently. I wish I felt like I was a Harvard student and that I've made an academic home here. If only it felt that simple.

So, yeah. Impostor Syndrome.

But let me be clear, none of this feeling has come from students, faculty, etc. I've pretty much always been treated as if I AM a legitimate student here. It's just that some of the discussions here and a few blogs have left me feeling pretty...fake. Sure, many HU alumni and students defend HUES students and thus balance things out - but the negative sticks with you.

But then again, I feel like each school kind of tries to diminish each other in a ribbing-way, so perhaps that means I fit right in.

csornah,"Hi, I'm a freshman thinking about my concentration. I came to Harvard leaning Applied Math, but after taking CS50 last fall and working on a cool project during winter break, I think I just wanna do straight up CS now. I really enjoy it.

I'm just scared of CS124 (pseudorequirement). I am not a genius, and I feel like it already takes me more time than most in Math 21/CS50/CS51 to truly get the concepts. I also wouldn't call myself mathematically mature since I haven't ever done proof based math. My grades have been pretty good so far, but I just think I spend more time than most people on average. 

I read the past 5 years of Q Guide reviews for CS124, and the vast majority of people found the course to be brutally difficult, with workloads reaching 30+ hrs/wk for some. General consensus was that the course attempts to cover so much material at such a high level that most don't end up learning a lot anyway since scrambling to get points here and there on exams and submitting psets on time becomes priority. That's so depressing to me. This is the most important material to learn as a computer science student, and I don't want to have such a shitty experience learning it. 

Since CS124 isn't a real requirement, I was considering just taking the MIT course (6.006) and taking some other 120s class (like 126 or 127) to satisfy the 2 theory requirements. Does anyone have experience with skipping 124 and just taking it at MIT? I know it's the path less traveled and my CS friends will probably give me a lot of shit for it, but I just want to actually learn data structures and algorithms and maintain good mental health.

Dkennemo,"Over the years, I've heard people talk about elitism in certain segments of higher education, and such talk always seems to lead back to the Ivy League.

However, when I applied to Yale's MBA program and spent some days on campus talking to various students (not just in the management program, in other schools as well), the people I met there were warm, welcoming and friendly. They sure didn't seem to look down on others who were not like them, nor show any of the other ugly behaviors people associate with ""elitism"".

Now as a master's student in Harvard's Extension School, I'm interacting with cool, intelligent people who are well read and always up for a solid discussion (if they've the time). (I actually seldom see the students in the Extension school, as all my classes have been in SEAS.)

What I *don't see* - what I see *no trace of* - is any kind of snobbery, I'm-better-than-you-attitude, etc. I tried - but failed -
 to observe any sign of this directed either toward me or toward people at different schools. (Supposedly, people in the past were fond of bashing the K-School, the Education School, and the Extension School - I read nonsense of that sort online, but as for words coming out of the mouths of Harvard students: nope, haven't seen it happen.) 

Yet, interestingly, most people at the school seem to believe that others around them hold these attitudes. It's just that no one ever seems to see it firsthand.

So ... what gives? Is this just a reputation thing permanently lodged in peoples' imaginations that doesn't echo reality but somehow still dies hard? Is it a cultural meme of some kind? Or is it because I hang with the engineers who are somehow mentally wired more for meritocratic ideals?

mytossus,"Coming to Harvard! Yay!

As excited as I am, I'm equally as nervous. Here are some of my concerns:

1. **I have a strong case of the ""they probably made a mistake in admitting me"" suspicion.** Along with this suspicion comes a fear of inadequacy among my future peers. I feel like high school was not challenging enough to force me into developing time management skills, organization skills, etc. I know for a fact most Harvard students will be wildly skilled in all these departments, putting me at a severe disadvantage. I also know that it's likely Harvard will be more academically rigorous than my high school was. I feel very behind, but I still want to do really well. How can I learn to build these skills? What can I do to ensure I don't completely fail? And what resources can I make use of to help me out?

2. **I have never visited Harvard or Boston and I'm moving very far to attend.** I'm absolutely exploding with excitement to come here, but there's a nagging sadness in the back of my head about leaving home. I will not be able to visit home often and I'm worried about how I will fare on my own here. Also not knowing much about Boston, I do not know what to expect. How is Boston?

If you're like me you should have gotten an email from [harvard@electionservicescorp.com](mailto:harvard@electionservicescorp.com) today with your Your Election Validation Number to vote in the Harvard University's Board of Overseers and for Elected Directors of the Harvard Alumni Association (HAA). This is the highest democratically elected Alumni board at Harvard and they have been filled with HAA selected alumni for a long long long time. So a group called Harvard Forward is working to democratically elect 5 candidates to the Board of Overseers to move Harvard forward (get it?) on divesting from fossil fuels, committing more resources to climate-focused initiatives, including recent alumni into our governance, and giving a greater voice to students. 

One of the candidates (John Beatty) is a friend from my time at Harvard's Environmental Action Committee so I can attest that this group is filled with super-stars. 

**Harvard Forward Five for Overseers**: Margaret ""Midge"" Purce, Jayson Toweh, Lisa Bi Huang, John Beatty, Thea Sebastian 

**Endorsed HAA Directors (choose 6 of 7):** 

Kelsey Trey Leonard, Joyce Y. Zhang, Mallika J. Marshall, Vanessa Zoltan ​​​​​​, Santiago Creuheras, Benjamin D. Wei, Michael D. Lewis

Instructions to vote: [https://www.harvardforward.org/vote](https://www.harvardforward.org/vote) 

A little about Harvard Forward: 

 **We recognize that there are many things happening in the world right now that need your attention.** The coronavirus pandemic is ongoing, and the Black Lives Matter movement still needs our unfailing support and attention. Many Harvard affiliates have stepped up in the fight to create a more just society and to support those who are suffering. Now it is time for Harvard, as an institution, to follow in their footsteps and take up the mantle of moral leadership and decisive action.   


The Harvard Forward candidates aren't just running on a platform of climate action, responsible investing, and inclusive governance. **They're running to send a message that alumni demand better than the status quo**; that alumni are looking to Harvard to take a stance on the critical issues that are directly threatening the wellbeing and existence of current and future generations.  


**This means addressing not just climate change but also systemic racism**, and Harvard Forward is committed to making anti-racism a larger part of our platform. We're currently reaching out to those in the Harvard community who are leading anti-racism organizing to find out how we can best support their efforts, and we'll share our progress with you as it develops.   


**We know that a majority of** **Harvard** **alumni believe that** **Harvard** **can and must do better.** We simply need to get the word to them that this year's Board election is the opportunity to create a mandate for change.  

If we get these guys on the board - **this would make history** by having candidates elected and represented by the people, not by being nominated by HAA. Last year less than 12% of alumni voted - if you see this and vote and then share it, it makes a real difference.

qsalwaysas,"Updated: All very insightful comments and not too surprising. 
Everyone's been thrown into the virtual learning realm quite suddenly which doesn't help given everything else happening. Too much to process. 

More Qs: are all the College classes just pre-recorded or is there a live Zoom component? I'm also curious, is there a difference in perspective amongst grad students, mid-career grads and college students?

I'm a grad student and absolutely love learning online. Most grad students have also spent time working and learning to delineate between work, school and leisure - a learned bevavior that quickly becomes important. One of the reasons it works from me, aside from my learning style, is the flexibility it affords my work. I've lived in three countries this last year, mostly for work, and am able to continue my classes uninterrupted. I especially appreciate the live Zoom classes and the interaction with other students. I don't think that'd make a world of a difference if it was in person (unless we're looking to make friends - but even then, I remain in touch with quite a few students post-semester.)

Initially, I thought it was going to be a breeze since I worked during undergrad and managed well; but, online learning requires a new type of discipline that took months to cultivate. (I saved my in class needs for learning languages but also transitioned those to online format once I left the country.) Making that transition isn't easy but can be rewarding.

not_a_professional,"So I'm not sure if there are any other Harvard Ents subscribed to this subreddit, but just in case there are, I thought I'd give a heads up to people worried about getting busted. Myself and another student were smoking in our room and someone called the tutors on us. The tutor came to our room, asked if we were smoking weed, and said she needed to confiscate whatever we had. My friend gave up about 20 grams (!!!) and his bong and they said they had to report it to the Resident Dean. A few days later (we got caught on the weekend) I get an email saying I have a meeting with the Dean. I'm pretty nervous but it turned out to be fine. The Dean basically said since it was my first offense there would be no real disciplinary action taken and that I just needed to stop smoking indoors. I have to talk with a 'Marijuana Counselor' but from what I've heard he's a good guy and it shouldn't be too bad. Overall Harvard is pretty chill concerning trees, but obviously I can't smoke in my room anymore. Considering the amount of weed they confiscated as well as the paraphernalia we got off light (although since my roommate did have a prior offense they talked to the Ad Board but eventually decided to do nothing as well). Anyways, just a quick heads up, happy toking/studying! 

Edit: If you have a problem with another student, I highly recommend going to talk to them rather than going straight to the tutor, it's the adult thing to do. I know that the tutors are there to resolve problems but the same result could have been had without us getting in trouble. It's fine if you're non-confrontational, but something like that can have serious consequences on someone's life.

KantianCant,"From Larry's email:

Last August, in a lawsuit brought by fraternities and sororities to challenge the policy, Judge Gorton of the United States District Court in Boston denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the case. In essence, the court accepted the plaintiffs’ legal theory that the policy, although adopted to counteract discrimination based on sex, is itself an instance of discrimination based on sex. The court reasoned that the policy applies to men but not women who seek to join all-male social organizations and applies to women but not men who seek to join all-female social organizations, and that this constitutes sex discrimination under federal law. In reaching this view, Judge Gorton relied heavily on the reasoning in one of the appellate decisions (Zarda v. Altitude Express) that was affirmed by the Supreme Court. It now seems clear that Judge Gorton would ultimately grant judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor in the pending lawsuit and that Harvard would be legally barred from further enforcing the policy. 

In view of the Supreme Court’s decision, following Judge Gorton’s prior opinion in the lawsuit against Harvard, the Corporation consulted with the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Dean of Harvard College, and the University’s General Counsel last week. We together came to the view that, in the circumstances, the College will not be able to carry forward with the existing policy under the prevailing interpretation of federal law. As a result, following a vote of the Corporation on Friday to rescind its prior approval, the policy will no longer be enforced.",Sanctions against final clubs were just lifted,10,0.71,hi98yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/hi98yi/sanctions_against_final_clubs_were_just_lifted/,0,1593494888.0,2020-06-30 00:28:08

Let's let Ben and his family know that the Harvard Square and the Harvard University community continue to support his valiant efforts. Let’s make this 3rd Annual Ben Abercrombie Day even bigger and better than the first two! There are several ways to help:

moldycheddar,"Hello fellow virgins,

I’m a first-year, focusing on physics and aspiring to earn a PhD.

I’m extremely interested in doing scientific research as a career, and despite humoring the possibility of becoming a biochemist, psychologist, or even surgeon, I’ve half-assedly decided on physics. Once I took some intro courses, I began to realize how the study could become so interesting to some. I would love to research physics as a career, but I hear that this position is extremely difficult to obtain. Also, and especially if you aren’t one of the lucky, super-intelligent few, you may be stuck in a not-so-lucrative position as an extremely over-qualified person.

Would it be safer to go along with some other science, or should I stick with it? I do want to earn a PhD. in whatever I decide to study, however, I don’t want to be living on the side of the road after having gone to school for ten years earning a whole doctorate in some focus of physics... I would also be pretty resentful if I were to become a software engineer (apparently programming is a popular career for those who are not lucky enough to stay in academics), having just spent those ten years studying something with so much more potential. If I wanted to become a programmer, I would have just gotten some certifications and built a portfolio - significantly cheaper and less rigorous than a PhD. Also, if I may, how do grad students support themselves while completing their masters/doctorates?","Students of physics, I summon you",10,0.74,ddjumy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/ddjumy/students_of_physics_i_summon_you/,5,1570287864.0,2019-10-05 10:04:24

AEP_Townsend,"[Here](https://features.thecrimson.com/2019/freshman-survey/makeup-narrative/) is Harvard’s “Meet the Class of 2023.” 

I am not a Harvard student myself, but a few things here confused me, and I was wondering whether anyone here would have insight into *why* some survey results are... the way they are.

• The number of students with an income of 500K+ seemed to hang around 13-14% for the classes of 2017/18, 15% for 2019/20, and 17% for 2021/22 (the class of 2023 had a “prefer not to say” option. Is this just inflation, is this trend insignificant, or is the number of ultra-rich students slowly creeping up?


• In the classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019, the % Jewish was 9.5, 9.8, and 10.1 respectively. Since then, it has not exceeded 7.7, with a new low of 5.3 for the class of 2023 (2022 was 5.4%). Is this response bias, or are fewer Jews matriculating?

• In the classes of 2017 and 2018, 12.5 and 12.8% of students had received mental health counseling. This number has crept up through the high-teens, and is now at 25.3% for the class of 2023, up from 21.8% for the class of 2022. Is this because of greater access to therapy, admissions changes, or a general societal trend?

• Most “National Politics” questions were “culture war” related, with some being *extremely*  niche. Why are there questions on transgender individuals in the military and separation of families at the border, but not a *single* question on education, healthcare, or economics? These are generally considered (along with climate change) to be the most mainstream voter issues.

I also wanted to say, the class of 2023 looks *quite* impressive. The whole report is fascinating as well — I am extremely impressed.

I am an incoming sophomore.

Should I change my address in the directory? 

Additionally, I recognize that some of the future punch events might take place in person, so I have been making arrangements to travel safely to and from these locations (I’ve heard NYC, Miami Beach, Montana and Los Angeles are some of the potential locations being thrown around this year). We travel safely in small groups <10 + inflight staff, and our family physician administers tests before any travel.

- is an Ed.M worth it? For background, I went to a top 20 school and studied business and education. Hoping to maybe go into education consulting after this 
- how much can I expect to pay? They’re not reducing tuition fees, so I’m wondering about the typical fin aid given by Harvard and how much I will need to budget/take out in loans 
- what are some downsides to this program being online? Time will tell, but I’m interested in hearing if people think this format will decrease the value of the program?

The problem is that the decision date for deferring my acceptance is May 1 and I can't change later when the situation is more clear.

Harvard announced today that they will have Fall 2020, but have made no decisions about online or on-campus learning. If they go totally online, then they will give another opportunity to defer and I will do that. However, my question is: if the fall semester begins on campus, is it worthwhile to take a gap year? I really want a good freshman experience and the best possible four years that I can. I know that next year is not going to be normal, there will probably be no sporting events or big gatherings, maybe limitations on parties, some online learning, and the chance that everyone gets sent home again. 

On the other hand, if the corona situation is really bad, there also might not be many opportunities for me on a gap year.

>On November 27, 2019, Harvard University denied tenure to an ethnic-studies professor specializing in Dominican identity. Students and faculty at Harvard and across the country sprung into protest mode. The failure to tenure Lorgia García Peña, they said, resulted from Harvard’s racism. NBC Nightly News, the *New York Times*, the *Boston Globe*, and other outlets covered the controversy from the same angle.  
>  
>In fact, García Peña had been catapulted into the academic firmament with a speed that most non-intersectional professors can only dream of. She has been showered with benefits. Thirty-one percent of Harvard’s tenure-track professors lost their tenure bids in the 2018‒19 academic year without alleging bias, since most of those failed contenders were white. Yet García Peña has gone through her academic career playing the victim, reflexively accusing those around her of white supremacy. In this, she is a perfect synecdoche for ethnic studies itself, which also stakes its identity on the conceit that it is in a nonstop battle for survival against the forces of racism and exclusion.  
>

I’ve noticed that my past few years here I’ve not met a single person in boston who didn’t go to this school. Not even a tourist!
Where’s a place where I could go and just talk to other college students? Any recommendations for student bars or cafes/tea shops? I’ve gone to parks and art museums already...which are really nice for some quiet time. But it would be nice to meet some other people who live in this city before I’m graduating and out.

,"Hey everyone, new to the area so I don’t know many people or all the resources at the school. Lately I’ve been having a lot of crashes on my custom desktop build, and I was wondering if there’s anywhere I could go on campus for them to help me troubleshoot.

mangopineapplelychee,"Hi Reddit! A couple of questions:

1) How do people actually get their stuff to their house? Do they Uber? Harvard Shuttle? Something else? Also, I presume that the trolley from Yard Ops will be in high demand so what's the alternative? Will Uber & Lyft drivers be willing drive into the Yard to load up your stuff?

2) I know summer storage is officially first come, first served (within size limits, of course), but should I be concerned about them running out of space early? I.e., should I make sure I get there on the first day that it opens? Or is there generally speaking, always enough storage to go around?

3) Would there be any repercussions if I stored some stuff under my blockmate's name? She's planning on hauling all of her stuff back home but lives more than 150 miles away. If not, how would I go about it?

Thanks so much for all of the help!
