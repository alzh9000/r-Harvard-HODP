I told the person on the phone how that made no sense and I could hear the wtf in her voice because she was confused too.

UoP has far greater name recognition than Columbia. In a recent study, 94% of strippers I tried to sleep with while stationed at Fort Hood were attending UoP. Additionally, when the New England Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX guess where it was? Yup. UoP Stadium. The only thing I'm certain ever happened at Columbia's stadium is Robert Kraft getting a handy under the bleachers. 

As for admissions; Columbia insists upon elitist barriers to entry, such as high academic performance and extra curricular involvement, while at the same time offering TOEFL waivers. All UoP wants is your money. And a passing score of 75 on the TOEFL (no waivers).

The WebEx vs Zoom debate; we are all familiar with WebEx not allowing you to automatically connect to audio when joining a meeting using TSP hybrid VoIP, even if you have the settings enabled. But did you know that you can hire a goat to appear on your Zoom call?

Miss having class in person so I decided to pay campus a visit,RJBalderDash,"I agree with you in regards to better testing and tracing. It's important that our country as a whole be better about this. However, NY has been testing more than just about any state (I'd like to say more than many other countries, but I don't have the data). But pretending density isn't a large part of the issue I think is prematurely dismissive of how packed the subways get in NY and space is not to be really had during commutes in NYC. California had strong efforts but also many people drive and buildings are spread very far apart. As for NYers not behaving correctly, you will find that to be true in every state and every country, the US is not the only place where people have protested or just blatant forgoing of social distancing. People, in general are doing what they are supposed to. If they weren't, we wouldn't see a plateau in hospitalizations and deaths.

18-year-old Barnard student fatally stabbed in Morningside Park,Tofon,"And if NYC insists on sticking with large project style public housing he's right. Places like that have no place in this neighborhood today. 

Large public housing projects have a ""slumifying"" affect, where their violence and poverty seeps into the surrounding community, if we want to build and live in a safe, sustainable area then it needs to go. It's a remnant of a past-Harlem, a Harlem where some 18 year old girl getting stabbed in a mugging wouldn't even make headlines like this because it was just a fact of life. 


And I know that this going to bring up a lot of ""anti-gentrification"" sentiment, especially from Columbia's student body, so I'm just going to get ahead of that. ""Old Harlem"", so to say, was truly frightening. People got shot, people got killed, people got mugged, raped, assaulted and beaten up; all over nothing. Over a few dollars, because they thought you looked at them wrong, because you had the wrong colors on, because you weren't from here, or because they just fucking felt like it. People would shoot up in broad daylight, people smoked crack on the front steps. You'd be afraid to let your kids walk to the bus stop alone and ""come home before the street lines come on"" wasn't about curfew, it was about safety.

I understand, and often agree with the arguments regarding gentrifying neighborhoods, but they don't apply here. This isn't about local business getting pushed out for a Starbucks, this is about not having kids getting clipped over a few grams of coke or someone's little sister getting killed in crossfire. It's always the white, tatted, pierced, crazy haired privileged middle to upper middle class kids from out of town who come in and protest the loudest about the gentrification of Harlem and Columbia's role in that, but I can promise you right now that nobody who lived through that Harlem wants it to return. Defending places that aren't just the quintessential example of that kind of violence, but the epicenter from which it spreads into the surrounding community, in a thread about a girl who just got fucking killed by that same, old-school pre-gentrified Harlem is a bad look. 

Public housing projects are poisonous to the residents and to their communities, and it's telling that the only people who defend them are the people who never really had to live in or around them.",13,,False,fajgp3u,False,False,1576136894.0,2019-12-12 01:48:14

18-year-old Barnard student fatally stabbed in Morningside Park,LunarGames,"I don't think having police patrol the park is going to solve the problem, just like having Columbia stationing security part time near the park hasn't solved the problem.

Lighting the park better won't fix it.

Erecting emergency call boxes won't fix it.

Perhaps doing these things will create an appearance of safety, but it cannot prevent something like this from happening again.

(I would argue all deBlasio and Columbia care about is the appearance of safety.)

This is a decades-old problem. If it could have been easily solved, it would have been.

Columbia considered buying up nearby property and erecting a fenced cordon around the area just for students and faculty. That didn't fly.

How to solve the problem, Columbians:

Stay out of the park, especially if you are by yourself. The geography of this particular park contributes to the problem.

And no, racists, I don't mean the street address. I mean that the park is on a steep slope, has trees, bushes, large boulders, and you can't easily sweep the park visually to determine where dangers exist, even in the daytime.

To clarify, one would only be expected to ""oof"" if they are so hopelessly clinging to the prospect of what is clearly not a good thing. So it is justified, I believe, to criticize that reaction and encourage people to recalibrate their approach to be more empathetic to others.

I didn’t call the virus a sunk cost. I said your prescriptive statements about our feelings toward the decision view it as one. To draw the argument out, you view the scenarios as:

Scenario 1: We go to campus in the fall and potentially cause deaths in Harlem. 
Scenario 2: We stay home at minor personal cost to avoid another outbreak. (Clearly the better option)

Which is why you’re relieved to see the decision. I/we view it as:
Scenario 1: There isn’t a virus in the first place, so we could proceed with the school year as normal.
Scenario 2: The virus exists and fucks everything up, including our school year. The email today was the realization of this scenario, with respect to Columbia. (This deserves an “oof,” when compared to scenario 1.)

exam writing on zoom is just dumb. I hate this shit so much.,Scoobydexter,"I had my students write their essay on zoom too and it went well in that they were already used to doing this using canvas - there is a link on canvas to zoom into 

The school depending on the department set the first one up for us - your teacher may have missed the gazillion emails and training on this 

I sat through six hours of training on Wednesday before my class at six

My biggest stress was students who wanted to start later not for technical issues but ok

As I tried to reset their times to accommodate them, I accidentally locked out all who were on Time and had already started 😳 

I made sure to start class ten minutes earlier just to work out any kinks but of course we cannot plan for everything - I also extended their time to help with the transition 

Sometimes things are just quirky

We are working through it 

If it keeps happening- contact the department and ask them what’s up lol

I get it

Think of this ....

Most of us are part-time that’s what they call Adjuncts 

So no one in NYC can survive off of 3 or if your lucky 6 maybe 8 hours a week

This means we work at several schools to survive 

No joke 

Last semester I taught in New Rochelle, Bronx, Valhalla, Queens, FIDI And Harlem 

So include travel time and cost —- so working from home is a plus 

But now I have to buy equipment to pull off ‘’online teaching” 

I just bought a Google Slate on payment plan for $30 a month - crossing my fingers 

I also need —- Not to mention a decent scanner not a picture with my phone one - a proper one (I don’t have it)

Space to work from home - it’s NYC enough said

I also have new training at other schools with their own idiosyncratic needs and policies 

It is a lot

Oh yeah 

Especially if you have almost eighty year old parents to help out 

Etc

Oh I forgot I’m married - that means wifey time :)

The Lack of Zoom Prep is Disgraceful,pflthepirate,"Couple of things from the other side (grad TA/TF here)...

Yes, it's definitely unfair for you guys. It is worth noting, though:

* Until a few weeks ago, we weren't going to be fully online. Quite a few people who'd had terrible experiences in Spring had said they'd teach in person if at all possible. (Columbia didn't tell us about how 'hybrid' implementation would work until late on, and it was so obviously going to be a disaster that few people went down that route unless forced). The original variant allowed us to offer in-person only classes (Columbia only got round to realising that quarantine and no early move-in meant that all in-person classes would have to be hybrid in early August, to much dismay...) 
* Equipment - there is limited Arts&Sciences funding available for teaching staff (but which requires tedious administration to get) to obtain hardware, but it's limited and the hardware then belongs to the university, to be returned at the end of the term. The option which would probably have led to wider take-up would have been the option of 'here's a grant to help you with the cost of a new mic/camera/ipad etc'; Columbia didn't go for that, though it was suggested.
* Lots of faculty don't teach in the Summer. So anyone who wasn't teaching in Spring (allowing for research leave, course spread etc, maybe 20%?) hasn't actually experienced the 'joy' of this approach before.
* CUIT has been barely visible, to say the least. Zoom Pro subs weren't done until the last minute, plenty of us still don't have Panopto access (and for both Z and P, you can't upgrade yourself, you have to file a support ticket with CUIT...). The course-shopping thing (courses open from Vergil, in theory, in add-drop) wasn't worked on until the last minute either, and while we've been told what the options are, guidance didn't actually go out explaining how to set the different options... The only thing to be seriously thankful about is that the university switched its LMS from Sakai to Canvas about three years ago, because Courseworks2 is the one thing that's actually usefully functional (whereas its predecessor was very clunky/dated/slow).
* Finally, in defense of people with bad mics etc, it's actually very difficult to run a test session (unless, I don't know, you put each member of your family in a different room with a computer and do a pretend Zoom class). If Zoom had some version of 'student view' so that we could see/hear a preview of what you're seeing/hearing, it might help with some of the issues.

Btw, here's something to ponder. TAs are indeed providing tech support again. The grad union was due to strike in Spring but called it off because of the beginning of the pandemic - Columbia has been doing nothing helpful at the bargaining table (and health insurance had been made worse again for a second consecutive year). Columbia's continuing intransigence (we were the only Ivy, for instance, to try to tell international grads they'd be unable to be paid if teaching by Zoom from abroad for legal reasons (not sure how they expected that argument to fly, when Harvard, Yale, Brown, Princeton had all come to the opposite conclusion); the university also enjoys pretending it doesn't own the buildings we live in, so 'can't' do anything about dealing with rent issues for people who left temporarily and got stuck abroad so can't move out, just to take two examples) means the union \*is\* intending to strike this semester.

Most new grads feel your existential angst even without a pandemic. For now, if you've found a place to stay that's safe,  you're already doing pretty well comparatively.

This is a good time to reset, recharge, and focus on your health and happiness. You could spend the time reading, writing, and joining virtual meeting spaces where ideas on what to do next could be better discussed. What are other classmates doing? How are they figuring out what to do next? Might be useful to call a few friends to just share thoughts.

There are some other things you could do. Research which economic sectors are growing right now and that you might have an interest in. It might also be a good time to work on another skillset or discipline or to use your background to write on the current events and how best to philosophically understand the changes and impact of the pandemic. Staying intellectually active and challenged may help clarify which actions you want to eventually take.

Apologies that there isn't a clearer resource or answer -- the crisis is still new, and the economy is shifting.

I, personally, felt some major impostor syndrome watching Class Day and all the recognition and the seemingly huge amount of people with honors -- but the way I've been reasoning about it is that it's *kinda* what I signed up for. Like we chose to come to Columbia and run the rat race so that we had these excellent peers challenging us and, hopefully, inspiring us. Like the way I've kinda been thinking about it is ""I'm in the same class as these future CEO's, Senators, change agents"" and using that as fuel for my fire to start thinking about the more concrete goals I'm setting for myself. I know I may not be as smart as them, but hey on paper the degree says the same damn thing. 

My thoughts have been really muddled with regret, sadness, anger, gratefulness and all too. So you're definitely not alone in that. I guess what's been keeping me going is taking baby steps at getting better and keeping busy... gardening, cooking, working out, trying to read a book a week. Of course I waste like 6 hours a day on my phone too, but whatever. Looking into volunteering somewhere nearby so I don't sit around continuing to pity myself and get back to feeling some sense of purpose. 

One specific point of advice for you, which I usually hate thinking about because it makes me feel cocky and brash: remember that CU has like a 5% acceptance rate. These are people you may compete with and get beaten by if you choose to remain in the top 5% but you can do amazing things and be ""shoot for the moon land in the stars"" if you feel the need to open up your options (other 95%). Ofc be humble and all but don't forget in the big picture you are a star.

Honestly, we're moving more in a direction where sole P/F option (with recommendations from your department if your an exceptional student) is becoming more of a tangible reality.

If you are struggling with this at the Bachelor's level, you might want to rethink your study habits and/or the field that you are in. Generally speaking, students that excel in critical thinking are capable of doing the rigorous intellectual work expected of them in higher degree programs.

I will also uphold equity and honesty in the evaluation of my work and the work of others. I do so to sustain a community built around this Code of Honor.""

I'm surprised no one brought this. If you are a Columbia College student, you are bound by a literal Code of HONOR regarding the integrity of your work. ""Cheating"" goes against the concept of academic integrity, the idea that you developed your thoughts of your accord. And you can get expelled for it. It is in the interest of the university to pursue cheaters. When cheating occurs on a mass scale, it slows erodes the academic integrity of the institution, therefore, you ""cheapen"" the degree. When students engage in cheating, they are not only doing a disservice to them selves, but to their classmates, their professors, the administration and the greater Columbia community. This is also where cheating crosses over from being an ""individual"" problem to a community problem.

Also, I know I struck a nerve by confirmation of the statement, ""I just dislike it when..."" There are no broad generalizations about ""people"" here. I'm simply stating an observation, I've seen cheating occur on all levels, across all backgrounds, all walks of life and it is in the university's best interest to call it out.

There are two good mexican places, one called Tacqueria y Fonda (iirc) on 108 amsterdam and the other called el porton on 122 broadway. Tacqueria y Fonda is very hole in the wall authentic shit, and is the only place that rivals the places in California.

For tea, there was this taiwanese tea shop on 103 that used to make the best bubble(or no bubble) tea, but they mightve had a change in ownership

Other good places include the hungarian pastry shop if you are into deserts and the craftsman on 123 and broadway is good for decent food and a place to work",14,,False,fsp2o00,False,False,1591145144.0,2020-06-02 19:45:44

Someone who lived at International House has died from COVID 19,not_a_theorist,"Hundreds of students and young professionals at a residential building in Upper Manhattan have been ordered to move after a staff member tested positive for the coronavirus and a resident died from the illness.

The International House New York, which offers dormitory-style living with shared bathrooms and lounges, told all residents in its South Building that they must vacate by Friday, sending students, many of them new to the United States and with little means, scrambling to find new housing.

There are between 300 to 500 residents in the South Building, many of whom attend Columbia University. The order came after a staff member tested positive last week for the coronavirus.

Early Sunday, management at the International House, also known as the I-House, announced that a resident with the virus had died, according to an email obtained by The New York Times.

“It is with tremendous sadness that I write to inform you that an I-House resident has passed away from complications from the Covid-19 virus,” the management wrote to residents. “We are sharing this heartbreaking news, which we just learned a few hours ago, because of the need to get this information to our community immediately during the extremely difficult time.”

Management at the International House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Students on Sunday said they were frantically packing their belongings and relying on friends to help find new housing. They said officials at the International House told them that the state’s newly announced moratorium on evictions did not apply because the residents signed a contract stating the International House is not a traditional landlord.

Students also said the International House had disclosed no information about the people who tested positive or whether they had contact with other people.

“I’m so uncertain because there are more people here who have this virus,” said a 26-year-old graduate student at Columbia University who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “People here are in a difficult economic situation.”

The student was moving on Sunday into an apartment in Manhattan with three friends.",24,,False,fl81f9i,True,False,1584913867.0,2020-03-22 16:51:07

- wash their hands frequently, especially after touching the above

Rehabilitation is generally ignored since it has never proven to be effective.  The fact that an offender is a juvenile affects his capacity for culpability but not much in my experience.  Just creating a blanket policy of giving lighter punishments to 13 year old offenders frustrates the normal policies behind punishment if it is done without regard to the offense charged.

Columbia (maybe less Barnard) has never really had great relationship with the surrounding communities and this reality gets downplayed to new students. In all honesty, part of this tension got amped up when the administration decided to break ground for construction in a predominately black and Latino neighborhood on the border of Morningside Height sand Manhattanville in the recent years. The administration knew that there was going to be tension. It was raised by multiple students, ""How does this benefit the locals, the residents, businesses and the people that construction could potential displaces?"" He totally downplayed the idea that expanding the campus into largely black and Latino working class neighborhoods would inevitably piss some people off. It's sad though that the backlash has to be on students. If Columbia wants a safe campus, they have to act both ethically and think for the long term when it comes to community relations. The administration also has to confront the dual nature of their thinking and the reality of runaway radical leftist ideology that it seeks to promote: we are an extremely wealthy university with ample funds to invest in a better relationship with our neighbors, but we seek to cloister ourselves from the rest of Manhattan if you're not in the billionaires (or millionaires) club. God knows it's easier to get in CC if you are the child of an alum, have wealth and/or have the know-all to promote **our ideas, our narrative.** What about everybody else? I don't want to shit on Professor Bollinger, but I can't help to think of his relationship with the Clinton family and other DNC leaders. What's going on is just another level of thought police and mass enslavement. As much as I love this school, there are times when this university (as an institution) and people affiliated with it are just an extension of ""the mob.""

Edit: (Original comment)

1.) Columbia/Barnard did not issue a warning to freshman, first time students about the safety in surrounding neighborhoods, especially the parks. No effort was made by the school to illustrate the complicated history and sometimes fucked up relationship the University has with neighboring communities like Harlem and northern half of Morningside Heights. Tensions (not always racial) between the institution itself and the local neighborhoods are there. I think the University bears some level of responsibility for not making its students aware of this reality, imo.

Tensions (not always racial) between the institution itself and the local neighborhoods are there. I think the University bears some level of responsibility for not making its students aware of this reality, imo.

2.) Campus security is an alternative to NYPD presence. Often times, security companies hire individuals with appropriate backgrounds from neighboring communities and occasionally these individuals also have backgrounds in law enforcement. It is a win-win circumstance: the University now has an ""in"" with the locals and the surrounding communities benefit who are wary of increased police presence receive both opportunity for employment and the benefit of a familiar face watching out for not only people affiliated with the university, but for locals.

In answer to your question, if the evidence against him was sound enough for a jury to convict, my own need to see the kid being punished could be satisfied with life in prison without the possibility of parole which constitutionally would be the maximum penalty for this crime for a 13 year old but obviously it is the conscience of the community which is supposed to decide.

Again I am not especially focused on rehabilitation.  Criminal law has moved away from that direction for surprisingly practical decisions for several decades now.  My own desire is really just to see the perpetrators severely punished.  People on this forum might thing that desire is base but most of society at large also have that desire for these types of cases and the law has long recognized and endorsed that view.

In terms of utilitarianism, a life in prison sentence would have the effect of keeping these kids out of the community for their entire lives and would also remind others that 13 years olds can be held responsible fortheir actions.

1.) Fair statement.

2.) Ehh, it may not have been on the ""enclosed campus"" proper, but the photos of the crime scene put it firmly on the upper part of the steps near the guard station. Yes, security can't patrol the park, but they do have a view of the park (not always clear) and the steps. Good point though.
 
3.) There are a lot of conflicting stories/narratives on this. Columbia has their own narrative, students have their own narrative and there are several different media narratives on this (CBS, ABC, DailyMail, etc.) Truth is going to be somewhere in-between all these. I'm more inclined to believe students because I am a recent alum. The criminal case, the report from Saint Luke's Hospital and the autopsy report will likely shed some light on what went down and how it went down. Too, we had a suicide on campus a few years ago where a young woman jumped from a 6th or 7th floor window onto one of the side streets during the first week of classes.

No last meal bullshit either. No waiting years on death row. Same for child rapists, etc. They don’t get to have what they took from someone else (life). 

In terms of what rehabilitation is, I think my point comes down to a fundamental difference in morality. To me, I don’t care what trauma the killer endured, how much they regret it, their pain, their suffering, or how harmless the person has become. To me, absolutely nothing can erase the sin of murder and it should never be forgiven. Nothing can ever come close making up for the act of taking a life and no one who has done that deserves to live, to experience freedom or happiness etc even for one brief second.

nice,MyStackFlowethOver,"That's a sneaky way to break down ""ethnic diversity"", and hides the actual campus diversity stats, although I'm not sure why they would bother since Columbia is already pretty diverse compared to the US average. This is the actual breakdown for CC/SEAS US-resident students, with % change from the US average given in parenthesizes.


40.3% White (-21.2%)   
23.7% Asian (+18.4%)   
16.6% Hispanic or Latino (-1%)   
9.1% Black/African American (-3.2%)

Columbia does not provide a breakdown for non-resident aliens so I couldn't include them, although I suspect that they would just pull the stats a bit more towards Asian and white. I used data from Columbia and the American Community Survey run by the U.S. Census Bureau.

nice,749534,"Well, to have an entirely complete answer, they are marginalized - in culture, art, and similar areas. And some sections of the Asian population (Hmong and Cambodian), they suffer from higher poverty rates. 

However, specifically for the purposes of a university demonstrating diversity, Asians are usually not defined as marginalized, and for good reason. They have the highest HS graduation rates, college acceptance rates, and College graduation rates. Diversity also includes income as well, and Asians have a higher average income than any other ethnic group. If Columbia happened to have a higher attendance of Hmong and Cambodian students, that would demonstrate diversity. But I imagine most of Columbia's Asian students come from higher income families. 

Frankly Columbia is making no effective efforts for diversity- they have lower rates of *educationally and economically* marginalized racial groups, and the higher attendance of Asian groups is fine- they deserve a great education with how well they've done in HS (as opposed to some ivy league schools that are rumored to have unfairly higher standards for Asian students).

Columbia unpopular opinions: let’s hear em,itanorchi,"Most people are unnecessarily hyper-stressed. 

The stress culture makes you feel like you should be stressed, and if you aren’t, you’re clearly not trying enough. That is ridiculously toxic and utterly useless behavior. Yes, some days are more stressful than others, but you don’t need to feel stressed just because everyone else is. More importantly, most people would be less stressed if they maintained a properly organized life. This means that if they set their priorities straight, started their assignments a little early at least, forced a regular sleep habit, ate healthy, utilized office hours when needed, had enough social life to be happy, had some exercise, and didn’t waste almost all weekends they would probably be less stressed. I understand that balance is so hard to do and accomplish. The goal shouldn’t be to have all of that in your life immediately. There shouldn’t be direct goals in fact- they should be attempted habits you try to implement as much as you sanely can. For example, I know it’s hard to get yourself to the gym everyday on a consistent schedule. Instead of setting aside a certain time to go to the gym, start going at whatever time is free. You’ll eventually make it a part of your day. Another example- it’s hard to not procrastinate and start an assignment early consistently like a robot. So don’t make it a robotic goal for all classes- focus on taking one class first and starting that class’ assignment early at least. Same goes for sleep. Don’t force the same bed time everyday if you can’t. Reserve one day at first, and slowly include other days. Eventually, you’ll develop healthier habits that will seamlessly integrate into your day. You’ll be far less stressed that way. Your grades will improve too. I boosted my overall gpa by a whole point in SEAS (1.0+) by thinking this way. I stopped buying into the enforced stress culture and lived on my own terms and rhythm and was much happier for it.",30,,False,fr0kabo,False,False,1589798650.0,2020-05-18 05:44:10

The problem book she wrote for the class is an educational wonder, and she uses multimodal pedagogy that makes the class adaptable to a lot of different student preferences--I rarely went to lecture and taught myself almost entirely from her outlines and practice problems. People complain about her exams, but I thought the questions struck a careful balance between rewarding preparation and requiring on-the-spot critical thinking, and my performance was always closely correlated to how well I had studied.

I can't speak to how useful her course is for more advanced biology classes, but I felt like having taken her class gave me a significant advantage throughout the preclinical years of medical school, and I still lean on the frameworks I learned in her class in clinical settings and on licensing exams.",4,,1589829835.0,fr20l3h,False,False,1589829100.0,2020-05-18 14:11:40

Email from Barnard about Next Year,happyfish2019,"Well regardless of your thoughts on Barnard's relevancy to Columbia, the email specifically focuses on academics. While the information about First Year Writing and Seminar is not relevant to non-Barnard first-years, the information about the revised academic calendar and course offerings are relevant to undergrads at CC/SEAS/GS in addition to Barnard. As the email states:

 ""Our [calendar for the Academic Year](https://barnard.edu/academic-calendar) is now set. As always, it is aligned with the calendar of Columbia University to ensure that all our students can take full advantage of the myriad options available to undergraduates at both institutions. 

...

The Fall semester will begin as planned on September 8 and will end on December 23. We will be flexible and supportive in offering classes in multiple formats. All classes will be offered remotely or in a high-flex modality that allows for both in-class and online delivery of instruction. We are making significant investments in classroom technology and in pedagogic training that will enhance the quality of all of our courses as they are delivered in this new format.""

Barnard shares an academic calendar with Columbia and given the cross-registration of courses, I would say that that information is relevant. Even if you don't plan on taking a single Barnard course while you're at Columbia, that doesn't mean that the information about the updated calendar isn't relevant. Furthermore, what Barnard does for courses, does impact students at CC/SEAS/GS who are planning on taking Barnard courses. I fail to see the relevancy of your comparison of this email to what NYU and Harvard are doing. JTS I would say is relevant given the fact that student enrolled in the duel-degree programs take JTS classes. But, regardless of JTS, what Barnard is doing is an indication of what Columbia is doing. 

The point of the post wasn't to debate whether or not Barnard is part of Columbia. It was to share information that was sent to Barnard students with the larger Columbia community. Even if you don't care about what it says, the point was to just share the information to people who might find it relevant.",18,,False,fv581bh,True,False,1592416501.0,2020-06-17 12:55:01

I understand that you, personally, might not feel at risk, but the virus is community spread - and there are vulnerable people on campus. If a student gets ill, they come to class and spread it to their classmates, their classmates bring it back to their dorms, and that puts everyone in the dorms at risk, including vulnerable students who were using Zoom.

That is a terrible and selfish position to take in regard to a public health emergency. You don't want to financially disincentivize the university from making a decision to protect the health of their students. The university has not canceled classes because they believe the risk to students, faculty, and staff to be low.

Selfish? Oh come on, give me a break. It’s not like this university doesn’t try to squeeze out as much money out of their students as possible. They have a ten billion dollar endowment. 

A refund of a few hundred dollars of a student life fee is not going to financially disincentivize them and they’re not going to do that anyways realistically. Even so, they’re most likely going to react too late and not proactively.

So you're saying the university cares about taking as much money as they can from students, but they wouldn't care about giving that money back? I agree that the university would probably make their decision without regard to students demanding their tuition or student life fees back, but that issue is simply inappropriate and not important.

Yes. Universities are businesses. Columbia isn’t exactly known as a administration that cares about its students at all. Just look at how long they dragged out talking to the grad student union and the fact that GS is essentially a cash cow.

Prezbo email suggests a three term 2020-2021 class year,getmeoutofhere37,"This is the full Barnard email. Beilock is a great communicator and a QUEEN:

Dear Members of the Barnard Community,  
As we wrap up the current academic year and look forward to the next, I want to once again congratulate the spirited and strong class of 2020, and welcome the amazingly impressive Class of 2024 to Barnard.  
Looking forward to the coming academic year, we know we must allow health and safety experts to learn as much as possible about the course of the pandemic before final decisions are made. This is vital to protecting our community.   
Yet that patience does not mean we are sitting idly on the sidelines. Despite the challenges we face, we are doing all in our power to make it possible to return to campus as soon as it is safe to do so.   
Along with Columbia University, we will follow our current Fall and Spring Semester calendar, with classes commencing Tuesday, Sept. 8. In keeping with [President Bollinger’s announcement today](https://president.columbia.edu/news/update-research-and-next-academic-year), we will also be adding a third Summer semester for the 2020-21 academic year. This additional semester will enhance flexibility, add to the enrollment opportunities available to our students, and maximize the opportunity for on-campus classes. By early July, we will share more information about the specifics of the year to come – including whether we plan to start classes on Sept. 8 on-line, in-person, or some combination of both.  
At a deeper level, our faculty and staff are hard at work developing new and better ways to teach in these challenging and unpredictable times. Most importantly, we continue to promote one of our core values – education for the social good. Now, more than ever, we have an obligation to address the challenges of our times head-on, and to propose and evaluate solutions. Arguably, no institution is better poised than Barnard to contribute to a collective knowledge base that will inform our understanding of the causes and solutions of the current global crisis.   
To that end, I am excited to let you know that the College will devote a portion of next academic year’s curriculum to addressing the current pandemic in all its complexities and relevancies. Science informs solutions, and so does the societal and economic impact that the pandemic will have – especially on marginalized groups. Interrogating the “big problems” of this crisis from multiple perspectives will best position our students to be leading voices for change.   
This orientation toward knowledge for impact is not new to Barnard. From programs such as our [Harlem](https://africana.barnard.edu/harlem-semester) and [Mississippi](https://mssemester.wordpress.com/) semesters to our new [Barnard Engages curriculum](https://barnard.edu/news/barnard-college-receives-1m-grant-andrew-w-mellon-foundation), our students tackle real-world challenges around economic inequality, sustainability, immigration, and more. Partnerships with community-based organizations in our classes will enhance our learning, our work, and the solutions we can offer to the world. Provost Bell will be writing soon to our incoming first-years, transfers and returning students with more information about our important focus on COVID-19 “big problems” across the next academic year.  
In collaboration with the faculty, we are also exploring various options for curricular changes with the goal of ensuring maximum flexibility to maintain the health and safety of our community. These include several possible options:   
Traditional semester-long classes.  
Intensive classes to be offered in two six-week blocks for each semester that meet more frequently and allow students the flexibility to take fewer courses in any given semester block.   
A combination of both semester-long and blocked classes.An Academic Working Group, led by Provost Linda Bell, is focused on exploring these and other possibilities. Our goal is to be able to utilize the entire academic year as fully and flexibly as possible to maximize the probability of instruction occurring on campus and to uphold the academic excellence that is the hallmark of a Barnard education.  
A Return to Campus Working Group, led by Vice President for Operations Roger Mosier, is focused on laying out the various steps necessary to bring faculty, staff, and students safely back to campus. This group is navigating a myriad of issues such as how housing and dining will operate, how COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and isolation might work on our campus, how to manage the required cleaning protocols, technology needs for our classrooms, and more. We are also working closely with Columbia University, the City and New York State on these health, safety and operational issues. More information on our planning can be found on the new [Barnard Planning 2020-21](https://alert.barnard.edu/2020-21-planning) webpage.  
Your input is vital here as well. As such, I invite you to fill out [this survey](https://barnard.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3QOjzgYhGc1deHr) to help gauge your opinions on course delivery and campus life for the coming academic year.   
Through all we have faced this year, I have never been more impressed by the Barnard community and the support and care we have shown for each other. Together, we will continue to prevail and to thrive.  
Thank you,

And take a second to understand that. People are legitimately scared about themselves, their elderly parents, friends and those who have pre-existing conditions. Of not just getting the disease, but getting the disease and dying. You and I are in our 20s and 30s. If we get it, a couple days in bed and we should come out the other end fine. But I live in an NYC apt building with a bunch of elderly. If I get sick and spread it in the buildings common areas, they will get sick, and despite the respirator they're already walking with, they'll most probably not recover. This country does not have enough hospital beds or respirators for everyone that's going to get sick. No one wants to be in a position where they have to decide who gets a chance of recovery and who doesn't. This is about them.

I agree that students have a right to education and the world does not stop moving because of the virus. But this is a moment for some reflection and empathy. Columbia is one of the best universities in the country, one that students generally earned the right to get into and are paying a lot for. In this current circumstances, they've decided to go to online classes and reimburse where they can and feel is fair.

But what about the schools that aren't as wealthy as Columbia and the students that go to them? They simply had to shut their doors completely with no good option available.

I'm not saying don't be advocates to ensure you get the best education you can. This is an evolving situation and everyone is evaluating the best way to handle it. Maybe Columbia will go pass/fail.

A young woman was killed and many lives have been ruined because of this, including the people who assaulted her. Even if we throw those kids in jail for the rest of their lives, what would that solve? It just makes the situation that much worse. 

Imo there's a huge disconnect the Columbia community has with the idea of a police presence. The kids that killed majors were known for causing havoc and harassing people in the area, but police weren't allowed to detain or arrest them because they were minors. Honestly had those kids been locked up or at least felt the hand of justice at an earlier time, this probably wouldn't have happened. 

It's ironic and ridiculous that the community of Columbia and NYC continue to fight for and protect the very people who are out to hurt them.

And of course there are the retards at CU who attribute this tragedy to a lack of lighting. And who ridiculed a police officer for doing his job at the train station on 116.",14,,1581812425.0,fhqsz06,False,False,1581810765.0,2020-02-15 17:52:45

Sometimes you need to think about the situation from a different lens. Shes swiping in god knows how many people per day. Her job is to swipe you in and also prevent theft. If she let's people walk past her, that's her job that's on the line. Plenty of kids here feel entitled and that they can sneak in. They'll do crazy shit. (Other kids genuinely can't afford it. You have to remember though, people in CU dining are human and are empathetic to those kids. There's no need to sneak past.)  Dealing with 2000+ kids per meal, a fraction of which will be de facto rude and another fraction  potentially costing your job can make anyone a bit abrupt.

If you have never worked a job dealing with shitty people (yes, CU undergrads can be shitty entitled little snots), then count yourself lucky that daddy is most likely paying your bills.

"Random ""Columbia Culture"" Discussion Advice for Freshmen",CandidColumbia,"You were probably driven to make a post like this in the first place because, yes, it is annoying when kids walk into college with this mentality of still trying to fight others to get on top, and they're incredibly obvious about it. And you probably think you got some leverage on these clearly inexperienced kids cause they're younger than you.

Regardless, posts like this somewhat irk me, because it's like upperclassmen on this campus think they ""got things down"" and know ""what's cool"" or socially acceptable at Columbia.

Fuck that.

Many upperclassmen are JUST as cutthroat. Just cause you're two years older or something than these other kids DOES NOT mean you know JACK SHIT. There are PLENTY of things that even current upperclassmen on campus do that come off as pseudo-intellectual, pretentious, and competitive. It's just that all the things we do are subtle.

1) Secrecy. When we apply to internships or clubs, we keep it to ourselves and don't tell anybody, in fear that someone will compete for the same position and take our spot. Academia wise, the administration purposefully highlights **HONOR CODE!** in order to scare students from helping out one another when it comes to homework assignments. It leads to lack of trust amongst the student body and fear for getting caught yourself. So, when a homework assignment comes along, ""study groups"" will form, but everyone's pretty much on their own laptop or book doing their own shit, and they'll occasionally throw a question in the air like ""how did you do this problem?"" for a pset. So yeah, a) Kids either don't join a study group cause they wanna beat the curve or fear the consequences of actually helping someone and b) They join a study group and it's kinda lame.

2) Elitism. When we get into a specific club or group on campus, most of us immediately feel like we found our community, remain isolated in that bubble and only talk to those people. And God forbid anyone out of the bubble comes to talk to us, cause then that'll ruin how WE  look to other people in our group

3) Pride (transitioning from elitism). You can be all happy dilly dally with your OL group during NSOP or any other people during your first few weeks here. Then you'll eventually get to a point a year from now where you pass by them and act as if they don't exist. This shows the incredible lack of confidence that people our age feel, and it makes the people they ignore feel like shit.

If we're gonna talk about Columbia culture, you better start addressing more important shit like this instead of petty stuff like ""Oh my God, it's been the 5th time that kid said devil's advocate. What a pseudo intellectual."" It's elitist, prideful and hypocritical at its best.

But don't take this comment as an attack. I want you to take this comment as an attempt to be empathetical. Because I understand why you post something like this. It's just that, dude/girl, don't say stuff like this to scare Freshman or transfer kids into acting a particular way.

College is college. We all got our own lives, our own goals. They'll make mistakes like what you mentioned, but eventually they'll realize that competition shouldn't be their priority anymore. Working on themselves should be their priority. See my other posts for more info on this.

I don't think there's inherently anything wrong with playing devil's advocate as long as there is genuine intent behind it. Unfortunately, the reputation now is that those who engage in a discussion just to play devil's advocate do so to either (1) pick some niche edge case to flaunt their intellect or (2) defend a very frowned-upon view while outwardly disassociating themselves with said view (I think number 2 might be the big one, actually).

(from your old post)\^This is what I was responding to when I talked about it being a cliche. I was simply saying that there's no absolute NEED to use the phrase. I wasn't saying it should be avoided \*because\* it's a cliche, I was saying that avoiding it is totally doable.

&#x200B;

>Would you also get on someone’s case for saying “for example/instance...” rather than “to concretely illustrate this point...”?

Irrelevant because there's no stigma attached to that phrase.

&#x200B;

>I think it makes zero sense for others to judge someone over that

I mean, this post isn't regarding whether or not it's right that the phrase deserves such stigma. The fact is, whether right or wrong, the stigma does exist, and incoming students should avoid using it if possible. However, I do understand where you're coming from. Objectively, there isn't anything necessarily wrong with playing devil's advocate. I agree with you there.",2,,1567477977.0,eyuns85,True,False,1567467209.0,2019-09-02 18:33:29

"Random ""Columbia Culture"" Discussion Advice for Freshmen",CandidColumbia,"Absolutely nobody did. In fact, my time spent at Columbia has been one of the happiest times in my life! I've done it all--had my parties, had my relationships, and made a few friends that I can confidently say they are some of the closest people I have in my life! Which is why I was a bit confused with the response towards my post-- I hope it didn't seem like I was diluting the institution to something so negative. 

Oh, most certainly not everyone is elitist, secretive or prideful. But for a good portion of my time here I have noticed the behaviors I mentioned manifest themselves. And it's not because someone is born with these personality traits. It's cause they develop them through insecurity, and from the pressure the institution imposes.

Columbia--and undergrad in general--is all about growth and the development of your personality that you will carry into adulthood. It's an amazing experience. But my comment was an attempt to hit the nail on the head and show the reality of life not just at Columbia, but possibly every undergrad. We were just high schoolers a few years ago! We're growing and learning!

Hopefully we can see eye to eye man. I love this school, and my comment was an attempt to say hey, let's not pressure these incomers into behaving in any particular way. They'll grow and learn the right way to act eventually. Most of us eventually will, during undergrad or after.",4,,False,eyy2svo,False,False,1567569536.0,2019-09-03 22:58:56

**Most important:** Virtual office hours. This is your chance to confirm that you've understood a concept, exist as a human to your instructor, confirm exactly what is due when, and fill in the holes in your notes. Most teachers are going to be sympathetic to the shortcomings of virtual courses and also themselves feel a bit of stress about how to be successful.

With some teachers you can even get away with questions like ""what's the one thing you'd want us to take away from this week's classes.""

*Feel empowered to politely request changes to the office hour format,* e.g. ask for a time-slot signup or for the teacher to selectively mute & unmute people to give everyone a chance to talk (especially if the suggestion exists at  [https://ctl.columbia.edu/resources-and-technology/teaching-with-technology/teaching-online/office-hours/](https://ctl.columbia.edu/resources-and-technology/teaching-with-technology/teaching-online/office-hours/) )

\- If there are recorded sessions, try watching them back at 1.5-2x

\- Some teachers are rambly and insert a lot of extra conversation outside of the key information they're giving. Sometimes it helps to actively ignore everything that doesn't seem like it's worth writing down, just let it out of your head.

\- Think of discussion boards as just informal essay reading/response. You can even write a response on paper in one of those ephemeral quiet spots and then type it in. Try to get 'checklist' style requirements for discussion so you can ignore everything else, e.g. ""post at least one new topic and 2 responses to others.""

Anyone else here feel like they’re really lame and dumb?,MyStackFlowethOver,">I just want to read books and enjoy my life. Columbia is such a high pressure environment and even though everyone is stressed I still feel isolated. I know logically I can’t be alone but I can’t think of a single person who might feel the way I do.


You are absolutely correct, you are not the only person who feels or has felt this way at Columbia, unfortunately it's not an uncommon experience. 

I've found that when I start to feel the way that you're describing, it's helpful for me to keep a few things in mind that help to keep things in perspective. First of all, the root of a lot of these feelings of inadequacy tend to stem from the fact that we are comparing everyone's highlight reels with our behind the scenes footage. No one is putting their inadequacies and shortcomings on their IG or LinkedIn page. Even some of these rockstar students have their own problems, but we don't see them the same way they don't see ours. Secondly, it helps me a lot to try and ""zoom out"" a bit on how I'm viewing things. Columbia is a hyper competitive environment with some of the best students in the country; it isn't supposed to be easy. If we only view ourselves within the sphere of Columbia, it's easy to feel like we're not measuring up or competitive, but the truth is that most people don't win prestigious awards or have the ambition required to create major social change. Most people don't intern at Google or Microsoft, and no student, even at Columbia, is ready to go out and engineer the ""cool things"" that we are learning about. It's easy to feel like everyone else is excelling at everything, but while there are some truly exceptional students at Columbia, most people are where you are right now. 

However, some things are in your control. You are capable of things like building a portfolio and applying to internships, and there are a lot of resources around you to help you, especially with the latter. The only thing that is holding you back from that is yourself, and if you truly feel like you are unable to get started on those things despite being positioned to do so, I don't think it would at least hurt to talk to somebody at CPS about those feelings. It's free, confidential to everyone (including your parents), and can be much more helpful than many people realize. 


Most importantly I think it's important to recognize that the way you feel is valid, and understandable, but it's not reflective of the truth. You have personal relationships (friends and a GF), you have a GPA that many people would be envious of, and you still have time for at least a few extracurriculars/clubs. That's about as much as anyone can hope to achieve as a student, especially somewhere like Columbia. Not having a plan for the future or knowing what you want to do is completely normal, but don't let yourself become overwhelmed by your perceived urgency of these decisions. If you're feeling completely hopeless you can call any one of the student talk lines, a suicide hotline, or reach out to your friends or family. Because I'm horrible at managing my time I'll probably be up most of the night with schoolwork anyways, so feel free to shoot me a PM. ",32,,False,eatxw9t,False,False,1543633595.0,2018-11-30 21:06:35
Anyone else here feel like they’re really lame and dumb?,supdawwwwgwife,"Hey! Yes! I do feel really lame and really dumb! I was beginning to think I was the only one!

I feel dumb for different reasons, but I feel dumb just the same...

For instance, I’m married and a mom. I also live by the Jersey Shore.... so sometimes getting to school is tough. Like when my kid doesn’t sleep, or is sick, or NJ Transit cancels and delays trains (🤦🏽‍♀️). I end up having to miss class sometimes... and I am 110% judged for it. It makes me so so so sad. Is parent-shaming a thing in this context? Because if it is I totally feel it. But I am really doing the best I can. 

Also, I failed my first test at Columbia. And my second test for the same class. Seems like most people are in the same boat as me for this class, but as it stands right now, I’ll probably fail the course. I can’t drop it or else I will owe money for the semester (I am a veteran). I just have to take the L, and hope next semester goes better. 

I don’t talk to anyone. I have no time for extracurricular activities. Columbia is so depressing, but I only have two more years, so...

Anyway, I am also sorry for ranting, and I am sorry that I don’t have any advice.

You don’t need to be doing all of these things that you mentioned in order to be fulfilled. Columbia is hard enough, don’t stretch yourself so thin that you end up burning out. I’m a senior now and I’ve figured a lot out while I’ve been here. It’ll happen for you too. You should appreciate the fact that you have the foresight to find enjoyment in things. Some kids just come here, burn out, graduate, and have no idea what just happened.

I served in a very fulfilling profession while in the Army, I could’ve stayed in the field as a civilian without going back to school, but I would have to live in DC or GA. Our family is from NJ, I wanted to give my son the opportunity to grow up around his grandparents, uncles, and aunts. 

... and well... you need a degree to do anything in the tristate. My rent for an old, stinky 2BR condo here is about 3xs my mortgage in GA.

I’m also a Rutgers dropout (ten years ago). So there is some personal redemption in my Columbia endeavors.

So let's look ahead be proud you made it this far without doing another Jodhpur(8-12,000 years ago)Mohenjo-Daro, Nagasaki/Hiroshima(most recent)/Mars for that matter.

Beside Humility.

By the way everyone can be proud of who they are, cultural, ethnically, individually, personally: just realize everyone individual has their stregths and weakness..no individual is an island...grow up be kind to each other.

Affects everyone in Western society equally. Unless you're making the argument that white jobs are specifically targeted for outsourcing which there is absolutely no evidence of.

>Ever hear of black on white violent crime rates?

Are black or colored criminals deliberately targeting white people to commit crimes against? The available evidence says otherwise.

> Ever hear of the endless wars we are sent to die in for capitalist and banker interests?

There is no government policy to specifically enlist or draft white people over any other group. How is this evidence of discrimination?

>Ever hear of our helth care system in which the overwhelmingly white working and middle class gets an early death bed, but funds socialized medicine for the poor and elderly? 

Once again, something that affects literally everyone in American society equally. There is no targeted effort by the healthcare system to prevent coverage for whites.

The OP clearly said that racial identity groups arise from a struggle against DISCRIMINATION that directly targets their racial group. All the groups you mentioned have faced discrimination by either the government or people in society. None of the things you mentioned are evidence of targeted discrimination against whites.

Unless you can convince the growing fraction of minorities in the US to put away their source of power then it's impossible to quell the growing reactionary white identity politics movement. Mind you this is nothing that wasn't known before. Singapore ended migration because they saw it happening, and even Aristotle talks about something very related (""philia"", or innate bond between closely related individuals which allows them to avoid this problem associated with banding together). To me the only way is to convince those using identity politics to stop it, but that seems incredibly unlikely and I'm not aware of any historical case of that ever happening.

Also when Biden says that we're ""going away"" he means that we are both longer the majority in America. This only feels unsettling because Caucasians have been the majority in America since the beginning.

When Tim wise talks about replacing white people he means allowing other people to occupy positions of leadership and power. Again, this only feels unsettling because it has been the other way in America forever.

Also yeah most domestic and foreign terrorism in America is white men. News orgs are just scared to call things domestic terrorism.

""America"" was founded by a small group of ethnicities but grown by migrants from a much larger group, and this group has been expanding throughout all of american history. Also interesting that you mention the displacement of Tibetians by the Han Chinese in the same breath as America being grown on territories of sovereign people who were displaced and murdered and had their cultures destroyed. 

The big difference is that the homelands of the american forefathers you mention is actually in Europe, China is trying to destroy the culture of Tibet and largely their people, and America has only had a culture of ""whiteness"" in modern times. We're a nation of immigrants and always have been. We were created as a giant melting pot of all peoples and ideas. 

Also the people from Tibet, China, and India have been living in and around Tibet pretty much forever.

White supremacist CC student at Butler last night,PM_ME_FUNNY_ANECDOTE,"I know this guy. He seemed like someone who really didn't know how to act socially, seemed to be looking for some form of community but wasn't really good at interacting with people much. Quiet and awkward usually, but I saw him drunk once or twice and he got belligerent/obnoxious like this. Those other times it wasn't anything racist/etc., mostly just getting really into some dumb joke and taking it way too seriously (for example, he yelled about how he was the Holy Roman Emperor reincarnated). He seems like someone who needs a community and maybe some mental help (and also pretty academically smart in physics and math), and so I can easily see how he could get involved in some really unsavory communities online for the social aspect and have it spill out when he's drunk.

&#x200B;

I know this story will play out differently to everyone and especially to the media (this will undoubtedly show up in some news stories and get picked up by the right wing media when he's inevitably disciplined or expelled), but the message to me is actually how easy it is for this to happen. There are so many awkward/weird kids out there who don't know how to fit in. Many of them are really intelligent but feel estranged, and communities like the alt right, incels, etc. give them a community where they feel welcome and can blame their problems on everyone else. After all, they're smart and they try their best to fit in and it never works, so they can't possibly be to blame for their pariah status.

&#x200B;

It's not our job to fix anyone and it's certainly nobody else's fault when someone goes off the deep end, but I think we as a society are going to have to learn to intercept this effect anyways.

Also, what he is claiming is inherently flawed, but under what definition can you deem this as ""hate speech""? Where is the racial prejudice? The man's comments appear to stem from a lack of historical background, not a superiority complex. He even says he doesn't hate anyone--that he just has pride for what his race has historically accomplished. And if you really think everything white men have accomplished was done on the backs of others, maybe you should join the kid in a history class.  


All I see this as is another instance of outrage culture that achieves nothing but further racial polarization.

The hardest question to answer,Sushies,"Provided anything is open, the best restaurant experiences I've had in New York are Sushi Noz, Jean-Georges, Eleven Madison Park, and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in that order. People have militant opinions about the above, be warned.

Inside Morningside heights my favorite is V&T's pizzeria (criminally underrated-- don't come at me, Mama's Too people, I truly think it's better than MT), and Max Soha is great too. Tartina has some excellent pasta and a beautiful interior with friendly staff. Thai Market is an incredible lunch option. Go to Red Rooster in Harlem at some point, it's extremely good and an underrepresented style of cooking in the city. The best coffee is from Oren's and it isn't even close. Absolute Bagels is an Absolute Treasure, just don't go on a Sunday. Egg bagel (untoasted, of course) with scallion cream cheese was famously proven to be the optimal order by the math department a few decades ago. Every bar in Morningside heights essentially sucks except for 1020 which somehow integer underflows with its shittiness and becomes gold. The Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlburg flop ""The Other Guys"" has a bar montage entirely filmed inside 1020 and set to ""Imma Be"" by the Black Eyed Peas. I did a shot of captain morgan with Martin Shkreli here once. Imagine naming your bar just its street number.

The best dessert experience I've had in the city is Ch'an teahouse in the LES; Grace Street in Ktown is also excellent. Honorable mentions go to Baar Baar for Indian in the LES, Via Carota in the west village, Veselka for Ukranian\* food in the east, Sarabeth's Central Park for a classic brunch, and Gaonnuri for 50th-floor luxe kbbq.",37,,1588875211.0,fpr6gtf,False,False,1588844142.0,2020-05-07 04:35:42

The hardest question to answer,cu23guy,"What a fantastic question! Strap in, because there are so many restaurants that will blow your hair back. I'd recommend trying multiple instead of one. For a sheer taste-fest go with Jean-Georges. It was a crime that those bastards at Michelin stole a star from Chef V. I ate there when it was three and have continued to dine there and the food and service is identical. He still shows up from time to time to check on things. Go for dinner and wear a jacket.

I also STRONGLY recommend Del Posto. As an Italian restaurant, the flavors are less intense than JG's French-Asian fusion but everything is so perfectly cooked and paired I find myself regularly dining here once or twice a month. Ask for Dennis as your captain, he's great.

Honorable mentions include Daniel (Chef Boulud is also a great guy who is very involved at his restaurants), L'Atelier at Joel Robuchon ( very classic French style), and Per Se (from Thomas Keller of The French Laundry- very similar food.) For steak, definitely start with the Porterhouse for two at Peter Luger (Pete Wells recently eviscerated Luger which I think gave them a kick in the rear) and the Chateaubriand at Keen's.

The hardest question to answer,Sealas,"Maison in Harlem, amazing French food that’s reasonably priced. It’s about ~25 min walk from campus.

Manhatta- stunning views of the city during dinner (on the 60th floor of a building in financial district) and great food. Pre fixe menus.

Grimaldi’s or Lombardi’s for pizza. When I first went to NYC I did both, and a bunch of other pizza places because there’s no such thing as too much pizza. 

I haven’t been to Jean-George’s at Columbus Circle(it’s on my list), but I’ve heard from a few Atheists they briefly experienced God. PS.

-saiguette makes some of the meanest (in my opinion) vietnamese food outside of vietnam. love those dumplings.

-koronets is not very good but its a columbia right of passage and has huge slices if you are having a craving 

-barney greengrass: best smoked salmon in new york besides russ and daughters. wanna be a new yorker fast? consume the lox

-absolute bagels: what i wouldn't give to have a warm bagel from this place right about now...

-sushi yasaka is maybe not the best sushi in the city but is damn good nonetheless

-i heard v&t is open for takeout now. very passable italian food.

-jacob's pickles, or did you mean the site of literally every single columbia undergrad's birthday brunch at some point?

-cottage has excellent chinese food. i had one of my last meals with my friends here before we all got sent home, so i have some very fond memories <3

I am only speculating based on the data I've seen and the knowledge obtained through my education and work in drug discovery.

Look at Sweden, they have not locked down and seem to be reaching herd immunity as their cases are reducing. In addition to other studies, I am choosing to remain on the side of cautious optimism.

If I failed the course I would have had to humiliatingly postpone everything and pay for my own housing and stay another semester.

Columbia University Student Leaps to His Death,sethosayher,"I can so strongly relate to this. It's not only a pressure to live up to your own expectations, but to make the economic calculus of attendance worthwhile. Before Columbia I got a previous BA degree at Boston College, way back in 2011. I graduated *magna cum laude*, but also at the tail end of the recession. It was miserable trying to find work and escape the rat trap of my mounting student loan debt. That experience lingers with me - it makes me desperate to find good work. It's motivating but also a trauma of sorts, pushing me to work harder but also magnifying the emotional cost of each bad grade, each failed interview.

My solace has been my family, my friends and my beliefs. I can be penniless but I know my self-worth has never been pegged to my GPA, my bank-account and my social standing. Every day, hundreds of millions of human beings struggle to survive, to account for shelter, food, clean water. Are their lives meaningless? Are they not richly textured human beings, regardless of their material situation? Why do I keep falling for this sham, this belief that the better I do at school, the cooler my internship sounds, the bigger my total compensation from my future employer, the greater my worthiness? When I really accept that these things are un-moored from my value as a person?

This has become a rant, but I suppose I just want to say that I understand, and that your grades really don't matter, not where it counts. They play some small instrumental role towards a material objective, but they can no bearing on your what makes your life worthwhile.

Columbia=Come-and-feel-dumbia,beautifulcosmos,"Been there, done that. Some words of advice:

1. First guy is 100% right. The moment that you are having thoughts of inadequacy, you need to take a break, go for a walk, get something to eat or go to your dorm and take a break.
2. Don't compare yourself to others, especially those outside of your program or your field. We are all intelligent in our own unique ways. And there is a big difference between the skill sets needed to get an A in a major like business versus an A in philosophy. Know that you are enough. You got into CC, and that alone proves you belong here. Everyone has a starting point, even if you haven't mastered the knowledge placed before you.
3. Talk with your professors. Email them. Go to their office hours. Get to know them both as professionals and individuals. Ask them questions about the demands of your major,  how you should be organizing study time, what career opportunities you'll have, etc.. Don't be afraid to ask where you could be doing better. And there is no shame in talking about the possibility of switching majors too if you are unhappy.
4. Talk with older students within your program or major. Partner with them, study with them.
5. Use the writing center if you need help with papers.
6. Grades, GPAs are not the greatest predictors for career or lifetime ""success."" And the word, ""success"" is also highly subjective. I know a brilliant guy who is a PhD candidate, has a teaching job at another Ivy. Brilliant scholar, but totally inept at everything else; friendships, relationships, emotions, basic interactions, etc. We went on a date once, and he confided in me that he watched reruns of Arthur after school until he was like a senior in high school. Now, Arthur is a good show, but a well rounded person would probably do something cooler, like skateboarding or learning how to make a quiche. Not this guy. Fucking Arthur, Francine, Binky, Buster (best character ever), DW and the goddamn dog, Pal. After school. Every. Single. Fucking. Day. Should have been a big red flag. Pretty sure he also continued that routine into college too. Said guy likely has a perfect GPA, but there's no hope for him being that weird, cool, interesting or funny academic who students love to talk about and admire, like Foucault or Baudrillard. If our very small field had to eulogize him today, we'll remember him as a simple pedagogue, a teacher, but nothing really beyond that. No cool stories of partying, hijinks, joking around, good conversations, or overt sexual fetishes that show up in your writings. Just that he liked books. And Arthur. Words of wisdom: Don't be Arthur guy.
7. Happiness exists at Columbia, but you have to make time for it. If being Arthur guy rocks your socks, then be Arthur guy.",50,,1582947869.0,fj2mfax,False,False,1582947495.0,2020-02-28 21:38:15

You can still get a great GPA; 3.33 is fine for first semester since there’s plenty of time to improve it.

About future job prospects - philosophy degree is really good for law school. If you don’t want to do that I think it’s a bit more difficult, so it’s a good thing to be thinking about at this point.

Sure, there’s a chance you’ll end up without a job, and there’s probably a better chance you’ll find one.

Columbia=Come-and-feel-dumbia,OrdRevan,"Relax. It’s your first semester. You’re not majoring in anything yet. Forget about jobs. Enjoy college—it’s a blast. 

If you like philosophy, then the value of your education is going to be in the things you learn that will stay with you for the rest of your life. The tools and perspective you get to help you deal with tragedy, loss, setbacks, etc. Don’t worry about the grades. Focus on doing the reading for Lit Hum and enjoying college—let everything else be a lower priority.

Also, if you like philosophy, you might actually hate a philosophy major. I nearly finished a minor in philosophy—the study of philosophy in the department takes a very dry approach to fun and interesting ideas. The philosophy you read in the Core is way better than the philosophy classes offered from the department, because classes are small, the tone is conversational, and people bring a much more varied perspective. 

If you find yourself stuck in a grind in Butler and unable to enjoy yourself, take classes that seem more fun to you. Take classes with less of a workload (I.e. find some easy A’s—there’s no shame in it.)Take a PE class. Take things you might want to try, and do it pass/fail if you’re worried about the grades (I did ear training—it was a blast and I learned a lot about music). 

There’s no point in being in NYC and on Columbia’s awesome campus if you don’t get out into NYC or get to meet awesome people via on-campus activists, etc. 

If you get a chance, take any class you can with Michael Como. Especially his East Asian Civ class—it’s a mix of lit hum and cc, but with a focus on eastern philosophy. His classes really stuck with me in a meaningful way—much like CC and lit hum.",4,,False,fj6j0ms,False,False,1583073157.0,2020-03-01 08:32:37

Columbia tied for #3 in 2020 US News and World Report rankings,cjhkzz,"EDITED*
Same as last year.  Not much movement among T10 schools. 
Our big jump was last year from I think 8 to 3 because USNEWS changed their metrics. 
“Social economic mobility” was considered and GS students were a big factor.

But if you ask for my opinion (am a GS student). Anything that quantify the pros of being a GS student I think are irrelevant and should NOT have helped Columbia go up in ranking. Columbia has great programs and I really enjoy the opportunities here to learn and more but GS is the weird child of the 3(4, count it however you feel like it) undergrad colleges. 

For the following reasons
1) Opportunity cost - financial aid - basically funneling the large majority of students into specific majors that have the highest rate of recruiting into lucrative industries 
2) Ambiguous admissions criteria - some of us are smart, some of us work hard to get grades, some of us are geniuses (i am not one, but I always admire the Dual BA students), some of us are not the best but are extremely humble  - **BUT** some of the *dumbest effing* people I have ever met in my life who got their ego boosted by being admitted are in GS. They make all the ones who deserve to be here look bad. I understand that every school has a few bad eggs but the fact that GS is already so highly stigmatized and the it seems as if anyone with a ""story"" is allowed in is just unreasonable. 

I still love this school and feel very fortunate that I can afford* to be here, but there just counting diversity and opportunistic students do not count as a overall addition to the value of the school without research on how this affects the bottom line of Columbia.",7,,1568045001.0,ezpch32,False,False,1568037886.0,2019-09-09 09:04:46

Columbia myth/legends?,huggyobuggy,"Haha thanks - I'll post the site once I host it - it just has the philosophy tunnel system atm since that essentially met the bare requirements for the assignment and I'm swamped with work rn.

And hmm for a good starting point, I'd say Mudd, since those tunnels (while they feel a bit spooky) are technically open (as far as I know) to students. Take the main Mudd stairwell down til you reach the floor with the garage. Go out the stairs, take a right and these two huge automatic doors will open and you'll find yourself in a garage area. Don't go any further, though! Just take a left and there is a set of doors. It's funny cuz last I was there I think you needed swipe access and somehow I had it. Thos might be because I'm in SEAS so we get some more access to Mudd areas, not too sure about that.

Anyway, once you get those doors open, bam you're in some tunnels. Those ones connect to Schermerhorn (if you can't get swipe access the Mudd way you could try going around through Schermerhorn the reverse way) and there are some cool weird bathrooms and odd storage things (for example there's a cluster of like 100 expired fire extinguishers lol). I'd say something like that is a pretty good starting point, since it's (I'm pretty sure, but don't blame huggyobuggy on Reddit if you get caught!) legal for students to go there and it's a pretty solid tunnel network. Compared to some of the other tunnel systems, they're not too bad at all, but go with a friend just to be safe! It'll make a fun thing to do when you guys are bored or something :D

WikiCU has some stuff on the tunnels but a lot of the instructions are outdated. It has some pretty nice rough guidelines though.",13,,1589258391.0,fqcfc44,False,False,1589256815.0,2020-05-11 23:13:35
Columbia myth/legends?,rjmessibarca,"Holy shit. That's some great response. Saved! I have already checked wiki for the tunnels. The info is completely outdated.

Now all I got to do is wait for the campus to reopen, or should I go for it in the summers? I would expect less security on campus. And I'll definitely ask for your help again once I have explore these (or maybe you could on me some of the other tunnels if you like?)

Thanks a ton!!",5,,False,fqcg35t,False,False,1589257333.0,2020-05-11 23:22:13
Columbia myth/legends?,huggyobuggy,"Haha glad I could help :D and hmm yeah I remember I was on campus last summer - I didn't explore the tunnels too much then, but I don't see any reason why you couldn't. tbh security wise for the Mudd Tunnels you will probably be fine (especially considering I legit had swipe access to those tunnels lol). Worst case if someone questions you just say you're using it to connect to Schermerhorn or something and act surprised, confused, and apologetic if they tell you you're not supposed to be there. They'll probably accept your apology and you can go, but I doubt it'll be an issue for Mudd anyway! Also if you get caught (for some weird reason) near the garage just say you're using the vending machine located right near there on that floor.

Will never forget the time I was in the Butler tunnels and ran into a janitor and just acted like I knew what I was doing/was supposed to be there and the janitor didn't even look twice but I was internally freaking out lololol. But you never know, maybe you could run into a cranky janitor so always good to be cautious!

But yeah, let me know how your tunnel explorations go! Good luck and stay safe :) and remember that the possibility of getting caught in tunnels (that you're not supposed to be in) is never worth your tuition/good standing with the school, etc since Columbia is awesome and I would never want to get in trouble with the Deans or whoever for something dumb like that.

Favorite places in NYC?,doctorblowhole,"I don't know how it is due to the pandemic... but I loved the city for the food adventures with my friends.  


I saw Jin Ramen somewhere there and that place is way below my ramen standards. Don't go there. It's overpriced for such a mediocre food.

Here are some of fav Ramen restaurants in NYC to save others the trouble:

* ROKC - by 141 st and bway - my Japanese friend showed me this place and omg it's so good (try Sapporo). It's a nice date spot as it's a oyster bar. I remember there was always a line up for 40 or so minutes so you know it's good!
* EAK ramen - 11th st and 6th ave - one of my favorites. Their thicc'er style of noodles is a nice change
* Zurutto - 72nd st - I'm ok on this place but my Japanese buddy really likes it lol
* Menkoi Sato - near Washington Square Park. Their Spicy Miso is so damn good
* TabeTomo - in East Village - they bring out a heated stone to heat up your broth in front of you. Ramen also tastes really good. 
*  Ichiran near Penn Station is really good and consistent (I think they have over 100 locations worldwide - 2 in NYC midtown and morgan ave bkn)

Other places from the top of my head:

* Best Udon in NYC is Raku. They opened one in Soho but the one in east village is more ""intimate""
* Go to bushwick for some Houdini Kitchen Laboratory - really good bkn pizza
* For KBBQ check out Jungro in Ktown. Bring tons of friends with you. It's a lot of fun! If you want to celebrate it big time (say for graduation), check out Michelin star Cote (flatiron). For the quality and the price of their course, it's such a great deal.
* Go to Chelsea Market for some tacos no. 1 (there's a secret path to their seafood spin off - go find it :) ). If you like German snacks, you can get currywurst at the market too.
* Best sushi for the price and the taste/quality is Sushi Yasaka by 72nd st. Their Omakase is amazing...
* Best burger? Harlem Shake. Take the M60 and get off 125th street. Really really good. Harlem Classic, truffle fries, and lemonade.
* NYC has Fogo de chao if you want to eat all you can eat Brazilian bbq

"Accepted into Columbia, realizing it's not realistic to attend",Esquiror,"It sounds like you need a few pragmatic people to lean on during this time. People who can tell you how things are likely to work if you commit to this plan. You should sit down and hash out a few budget plans for different scenarios. I say this because it's easy to get caught up in your own world and make plans based on hopes and best cases rather than realistic expectations. Let's talk through a few of these points.

Unfortunately, GS is not known for its financial aid packages and it is unlikely that they will provide anything substantial, especially if you attend part-time. While you may receive federal aid and the pell grant, realize that award amount depends on the previous year's taxes. So if you earned a decent amount at your restaurant, it is likely to reduce the amount of aid you receive.

While you have hopes of working full time, realize that the coronavirus has negatively affected the economy and the restaurant industry in particular. People are not eating out as much as they were, and even after businesses reopen its likely people, in general, will be wary of public places. Additionally, businesses will likely continue to enforce social distancing resulting in fewer employees and/or smaller sections for servers.

As far as an apartment in Harlem. It's possible but also remember the other expenses that come with that. Security deposit and last month's rent, transportation costs getting to campus, etc. All said this can easily be a couple thousand just to move in.

Once you've accepted FAFSA awards you can apply for work-study jobs on campus. This may offer a better solution then commuting to a job in another part of the city. However, the reality is that you will likely have to supplement your living situation with loans/credit cards. I don't endorse racking up a huge debt so hopefully, you can figure out a way to work around this.

"Accepted into Columbia, realizing it's not realistic to attend",tugboatp,"I wanted to add that your Dean can really make or break your academic planning. My dean is a rockstar and really went to bat for me especially over my Core curriculum fulfillments. She pushed for my transcripts to be re-evaluated and I was able to transfer in 47 credits which saved time and money. 

I suggest researching and making an outline of how you want to spend your time at Columbia and then really partnering with your Dean for a gameplan. I knew the major I wanted and really drove the ship in terms of class combinations and what I needed to do to get me to 124 points in the most efficient and beneficial way possible. 

Your time may not be as long as you think because each major has different requirements. For example, if you need more seminars or the foreign language requirements, those carry more points so your class combo may be 3 classes/semester=12pts  which puts you at full time for aid and allows you to work while still chipping away at your 124 to graduate.

Also with financial aid I'm in a similar situation and all I can say is you've really gotta be annoying AF and advocate for yourself. The biggest lesson I have learned from attending Columbia is that you have to place yourself front and center, open your mouth, be a bit pushy and loud.

"Accepted into Columbia, realizing it's not realistic to attend",smoretti713,"Hey, let me first say congrats on getting in. It's a huge accomplishment and you ought to be really proud of yourself. 

Now, I identify with where you're coming from on a very personal level. I've worked in hospitality for over 15 years and have spent time at most of the Michelin-3 starred restaurants in NYC, but have moved into upper management and DO roles in the last few years. I decided to go back to school because I never finished my degree, and somehow managed to wedge my way into Columbia. When I was accepted, I was working as a Managing Partner of a big busy casual fine dining spot in the UWS, committing about 60-70 hours per week. Realizing this would be impossible to continue doing while also attending school, I decided to try out one semester part time (in GS you pay per credit, not yearly tuition) and attempt to live on savings and by picking up random jobs here and there to supplement my day to day expenses. 

Honestly, I wanted to establish myself as a good student and keep good grades so my scholarship would be increased. Columbia tends to re-evaluate your scholarship amount based on your academic standing, so I only took two classes and worked hard to get A's. Same thing for the second semester, but this time around I opened JFR's fine dining restaurant in Times Square as a part-time Somm. Finding the time to study the menu, grow familiar with the wine list, *and* attend/keep up with my course load was *way* harder than not working at all, so it became clear that I would need to find a less demanding job. I moved on to another fine dining spot in the UWS, which was a good fit until they closed. I finally found a good fit with a private club that pays a high hourly and offers relatively flexible schedules, I'm lucky to work alongside people who respect my ambition and are able to accomodate my needs. These jobs exist, but you might need to try a few spots out before finding one that feels right. 

One thing I would ask you to seriously consider in all this is, what do you want to get out of your time at Columbia, and do you want to continue your journey in hospitality? Pandemic aside, NYC F&B is a great place to gain ups and make a lot of money someday by doing your time now and moving into roles with bigger responsibility. Having a career that pays six figures in hospitality is not uncommon, but one needs to do the time. If you want to switch careers or are deeply passionate about some other industry, then I'd suggest you do what you can to make Columbia work. 

You can defer for a semester if you need to get your ducks in a row and save up some money, we're all super confused about how this upcoming fall semester is going to work out, anyway. I would *not* recommend taking classes at Columbia via zoom or in any other situation other than in-person, and definitely not in your first semester. Realizing that Columbia is expensive, like super expensive, is important. Your day to day will be costly, from transportation, to rent, to internet, to food, to books, it all adds up more than you'll expect at the onset. And if you're not working full time in restaurants, you're suddenly responsible for paying for groceries and creating a meal plan, which is expensive in NY. 

The choice is ultimately yours, I suggest you think about what you want for your future. Don't decide not to go because of logistics that don't make sense now. Nothing makes sense now, and you're absolutely right, there are next to **no** jobs in hospitality right now, our industry's future is tremendously uncertain. Consider finding work outside of the industry, if it comes to that. Babysitting and nanny jobs pull in a lot of money in the city and will sometimes give you flexibility to take classes at night. No matter what choice you make, I wish you all the best. If you want to talk it through further, let me know, I'm happy to continue the dialogue!",1,,False,fuo7rnf,False,False,1592021282.0,2020-06-12 23:08:02

Difficult to assess, and at the end of the day, talk to the financial aid office (I know they're being kinda unresponsive atm, definitely hit up their email) and see what they can advise with, and even talk to your academic advisor - my GS academic advisor is GS alumni, he's got a lot of experience in that realm and these guys can help you a lot!

I looked at housing off campus in harlem and the majority of it was disgusting and the landlords were somewhat predatory at the lower price range. Urging me to buy very quickly, even if it meant breaking my current lease.

I pay 1200+ a month for rent now but it's in fidi and it's fairly nice. I looked at other places in the 1000 range off campus and they were often scattered in brooklyn or the bronx.

That doesn't mean his brain chemistry and life experiences are the same as those of an adult.  There's a reason we treat children different from adults under the law.  How many of you all have a father in prison?

I'm not arguing that he shouldn't be put behind bars for an appropriately long time to provide justice for Tessa Majors, her family, and society.  But it's ridiculous to put a 14 year old away for life or however an adult would be punished in New York for this kind of murder, removing any possibility of redemption (call it Christian or Buddhist) and the possibility of a life outside of prison because of decisions he made when he was 14 years old.  A 14 year old who did what he did to Tessa Majors should still have a chance to fix his life and have a reformed adult life while still serving a stiff punishment for robbing Majors' family and friends of a loved one, an 18 year old girl of her future, and all of us of what she might have brought to this world.  I wouldn't be happy to see him out of prison before he's 30, or preferably 34/35 (20 years).  And I wouldn't be opposed to that being tied to a parole hearing focused solely on whether he has been able to reform and make something of himself and is unlikely to commit crimes again.  Sentencing a kid to 50 years or life without any serious chance of an earlier parole based on reform is ridiculous.

By the way, if you're worried about safety, you should focus on reducing violence and crime in prisons, so that people can focus on reforming themselves instead of prison politics and their own safety, not to mention figuring out job pipelines for people leaving prison.",0,,False,g6cblc9,False,False,1600885090.0,2020-09-23 13:18:10

"Columbia University pressures faculty into teaching in-person classes, triggering backlash",sail_the_silver_sea,"If it was a more reputable and known paper, I'd be comfortable talking to them about how my school (SIPA) is making a non-TA position come in to work all 15 hrs/week even though 4/5 of our classes are fully online, and the rest are hybrid classes. With no guarantees of pay continuation should the school close, no guarantee of pay if we're sick or forced to quarantine, and no information on how safe it will be prior to us making a decision.

At least with TA-ing, the requirement in my school is generally 2 hours of face-time during office hours for students, attending the lecture for the course (most of the courses with TAs are online-only), leading 3 hours of recitation (also I believe to be online-only), and grading exams/problem sets, all of which seem easy to achieve with minimal contact with others and in a fairly small group with adequate social distancing. Typically in the position I have we'd be cleaning computer keyboards and areas, checking IDs for students coming into the lab, and doing a number of lower-exposure tasks, but right next to one of our coworkers. My HR papers say I will not be exposed to infectious diseases but frankly I don't see how that is possible. In undergrad, I had to clean the feet areas of treadmills to get the salt out, so it's not like I'm scared of cleaning, but I draw the line at something that could kill me especially given that I was developing asthma living in NYC and prescribed an inhaler last fall.

I don't feel safe in NYC until this pandemic is over and I'm not interested in jeopardizing my health for a job that doesn't much cover the rent premium of living in NYC. I am currently seeking other employment that will allow me to work remotely and/or locally in an area where I can travel to work and the grocery store in an enclosed car, and live with far fewer people in my building.

I honestly think the difference in deferment would be negligible between having 60% of classes hybrid vs 10% hybrid. 

And even if letting professors teach online caused a lot more deferment, all that means is you might have to dip into the endowment ever so slightly to keep paying all the school’s inflated costs. I get that a lot of the endowment is earmarked for specific things, but there’s still a couple billion that is unrestricted. If there’s ever a time to dip into that, it’s now.

There's a pretty large crowd here of socially oblivious people and being nearly anonymous in Zoom seems to be exacerbating it.

I tend to just keep talking, or say ""Excuse me I am still speaking"" if they're actually being disrespectful.

And could a certain crowd actually read the fucking syllabi?

If the TA says that you didn't speak, speak up and say ""sorry it may have been misunderstood, but I was trying to speak and the professor gave me a turn."" Then say what you wanted to say. What they gonna do, slap you through zoom? This goes not just for classes, but for when you graduate and enter the workforce. If you don't take what is rightfully yours and given to you, then others will attempt to take it away from you. 

Also, the people who add no value to a conversation other than ""this got me feeling a certain way about myself"" and don't say anything substantive are everywhere throughout academia. As long as the professor isn't like that themselves, those students' opinions usually go into one ear of the professor and out the other. They can see through that of kind of nonsense.

I just ugly cried for two hours about financial aid not covering my tuition and not being able to afford my books for this semester and losing my job in March and having $3 in my bank account AMA,lunarlanding64,"Long response below but TL;DR - if you make yourself a very respectful yet apologetic nuisance by politely asking for them to open the purse strings and not taking no for an answer, sometimes they will. But the second you’re rude or angry, they will refuse to help. 

I’d suggest contacting all of them. That was how I got things moving. When emailing different people I made sure to hold them accountable. That meant I’d tell them what the other offices said. So if a person at SFS said they couldn’t do something but financial aid could, then I would email financial aid and tell them that a specific person at SFS said they should be able to do something. Actually making anything happen took lots of emails and phone calls. If I was on campus and trying to get something to happen I would show up at the physical office (after I called or emailed first to give me an in - then I could say something about how I called and this person said something but I still had questions or concerns). 

I would also make sure to ask questions if your financial aid award has changed significantly from previous years. Once my student contribution effectively doubled because they realized they should not have been paying for something. I went there and told them there was no way they could pay the new amount and why my specific financial details meant that.

They're probably going to #2/8 because of the media hype surrounding him and his work, and the number of people reading about (quantum) physics is small enough that media hype can significantly affect numbers.

I've also read his work. As someone with a good, university level background in physics and mathematics, I can immediately tell that his work is complete crankery. As some other people have outlined, he seems to be good at math (honestly, who isn't?) but he doesn't know physics and he's at the stage where he's become so convinced and in love with his own theory that he can't see how flawed his argument is.

Because I literally don't hate white people? The majority of college-educated liberals don't even hate white people. By the way, I'm not even pouncing on him, that's everyone else in the thread, all I did was disagree with him and call his physics garbage (which it very much is). I'm pouncing on *you* because you are an easy target and very easy to trigger, and as it turns out, seeing you rage is actually more funny than trolling Columbia liberals. Maybe it's because people at Columbia are at least intelligent, if not fanatical? Don't know, don't care.

Its also not true that the majority of innovations surrounding us were by white people. First of all, how would you measure this? I assume majority means 50% or higher, so unless you have concrete numerics, it's all just guesswork anyway. Second, innovations are built off of earlier innovations, and this goes back to when Europeans were still in the Dark Ages and Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern society was thriving intellectually.

Introducing culpameter.com,culpameter,"Thank you for your great, great question. So first, we also took into account that CULPA creators intentionally chose not to use a numerical rating system. We wanted to meet students' desires to search for professors more efficiently while balancing that with respect for the design of CULPA. So, we made this website to serve as a ""organized gateway"" to CULPA. Our website is not meant to replace CULPA by any means, and rather it is designed to enhance its usability. Throughout our website, we have links back to the original CULPA pages for each professor, so that students can first locate potential professors efficiently with our scores, then go to CULPA to read the in-depth reviews for themselves. To repeat, we made this website so that the process of *locating* potential professors is easier, and we still believe that students should go read the reviews once they have narrowed down the candidates. Second, I totally understand your concerns with our scores. They are by no means perfect; however, we are still confident that they are still useful enough to point students in the right direction. We asked our friends to check the scores for the professors that they have taken, and they all agreed that the scores are overall very fair. We hope that you do the same as well. (We are working on a feature in which students can vote whether the score for a certain score should be higher or lower, though!).

Having hybrid instruction is kind of the worst of both worlds in my opinion.

For the few classes per week I will be able to attend, everyone will be in masks. The rest of the time, I'll be stuck in my tiny nyc apartment not able to go to the gym or go out to bars.

the situation in a nutshell,OkIWin,"I talked to a dean this morning. The administration is very much concerned about coronavirus and are discussing it pretty much every day. They are also being advised by some of the top infectious disease experts at CUMC.    
   
Currently, they believe the risk to be low. Note, there are only 13 confirmed casses in NYC as of tonight (March 8th). To put this in perspectice, this is out of 8.5 million people in the city as a whole.     
    
My personal belief is that the risk is not worth the benefit of having in-person classes - particularly when some students and faculty are commuting from Westchester where most cases are. However, I recognize the administration does care about the situation and their justification for waiting does not seem completely unreasonable.

Demographic: Indian (F), Low-income family (10-11K/annum), Private School

•Probably going to major in either sociology or political science.


Statistics: 3.7 GPA, SAT 1300 (taking again in december), Somehow the top 1% of my class [My stats are really bad, but its mostly because maths pulls me down. I'm trying to increase them as I still have a year left with me]

ECs: 

1. Founder of a youth based activist organisation working to uplift marginalised people. We've run 3 successful campaigns and 1 petition is still going on. Reached about 10,000 people with it, and have received appreciation from an Indian Parliamentarian, Ex-Irish Prez's talk show and an American Comedian.

2. Have my own talk show, which is sort of a blend between politics and literature. It isn't massively famous, but its decent. 

3. Taught rural girls about healthy menstrual habits for a year, and also running a political campaign on a local level before elections.

4. Ambassador for an England-based non-profit. I'm one of the many from my country, but I believe I'm the only one from my region.

5. Speaker/Panelist at various seminars on activism and social justice.

6. Research paper. Its 'extremely interesting' as per my professor, but I have mixed feelings on it.

7. I've done a lot of online courses from Ivy league colleges and other organisations on social justice and politics (they were graded, and my grades were 73%, 94% and 96%), and was selected as a delegate to a college level seminar hosted by Harvard.

8. Chaired several MUNs, but I'm not sure if I'll put it on the application.

Curious about your chances? Ask about admissions here!,cj-2001,"A question regarding the interview. 


During last weekend I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity of being interviewed by the alumni of Columbia.

I was excited, but also extremely nervous. Wasn’t able to get a good night sleep before the interview, which in hindsight basically spelt disaster.

When the interview started, my nervousness made my mind go full blank. At the earlier stages of the interview, I was asked the question of: “what do you see yourself in 5 years.” I made a logical analysis of my situation and replied “working” when in fact the question is kinda asking about what my passions are and what my aspirations are. When I was asked “then how about 10 years”, which was him giving me an opportunity to recorrect myself, i replied “i think i will try to start something off my own with the experience I have had through work”. After which I think he kinda just gave up on me and started talking on his own, providing me his views on certain topics and also giving me kinda a life lesson while I had no opportunity to inject my own beliefs. I was smiling the entire time but my insides were ice cold with worry, fear, and a hint of despair as I knew at that time my interview was done. I was unable to say a single word about my activities, my personality and other intrinsic qualities of mine. 

I basically just made myself look like a person who wants to go into colleges to just get a better job, with no higher motives or aspirations. I truly enjoy my selected major and wishes to self-improve and impact others with my hobby. I wanted to meet excellent people and make their qualities my own, but my interests, passions, and views were unable to be expressed and I look just like a walking Asian stereotype that studies and does not think. I don’t think it was the interviewer’s fault as he gave me 2 chances to correct myself yet I threw both out of the window. Now I think with a clearer mind and I am mortified by how I have performed during the interview. 

Does anyone have some advice on damage control? With Columbia’s ARC(Alumni Representative Committee) stating that the reviews play a critical role in the evaluation of applicants, I feel like I lost my chance of getting into my dream school.

Then I learned about my arranged marriage this upcoming summer and my parents' discontinuation with my education. Now I'm working with my counselor to escape my home situation and attend college independently. Amidst that, my focus shifted from grades to my extracurricular passions as a distraction. I took on an additional research project, received my NYS seal of biliteracy in Spanish, qualified within the top .1% on the USABO Open Exam, expanded program to Hispanic immigrants, plus other stuff. Maybe this shows perseverance, maybe it just supported my grades.

- Most people (with exception for a few true superstars) are faking it. Don't let their perceived success weigh you down.

Get your money's worth from Columbia Health. For instance, the campus can sometimes be a pretty isolating and alienating place; don't feel bad about having to reach out to CPS.

Get your money's worth from the tons of cool events that happen every week. Por ejemplo, do standby for Urban New York (if it isn't a super hot Broadway show, there'll likely be quite a few standby tickets on offer). Attend random talks, classes, events. Read emails that tell you about these things.

Get your money's worth from the library system. Borrow Direct/ILL is seriously underutilized. I'm always stunned by the number of people taking a reading-heavy course that ""couldn't find the text"" and have to resort to print-outs etc. Even the obscurest book I had to find throughout my time was no match for ILL.

It's easy to make friends with people via living situation/parties, but that tends to be out of convenience rather than a deeper connection. I ended up sticking only with a handful of people from the few friend groups I was a part of freshman year, mostly on the basis of connecting. 

I'd recommend shuffling some activities around as you continue your time here! I definitely made a lot of good friends across various interests (language, work-study, major) as time went on.

Does it get better?,warmegleichgewichtes,"What you're experiencing is definitely common, not just at CU, but for many people entering college. People at your stage are experiencing a lot of change, and there's a lot of pressure to find new social groups,  be (or act) independent, and of course, to excel at everything.

This is a struggle for a majority of 18-19 year olds, and few have room to be truly open to supporting others as well. It may be the case that you don't have one or two really good friends whom you trust fully and can open up to. That's normal and ok – everyone is trying to figure out their own shit, and they would probably do more to support you if they could.

Given all of that, even though it may be weird or uncomfortable, your best avenue for support will likely be CU Health's Counseling and Psychological Services (or another licensed counselor). Even if the people there didn't seem helpful at first, be persistent - even demanding. Unlike your friends, it's their job to support you. You may need to fight for it, but they will be able to find you someone you can talk to regularly. I cannot overstate how much of a positive impact having a regular relationship with a counselor has had for me.

> Updated on December 5 at 2:55 a.m. Saturday Night Live writer and comedian Nimesh Patel was pulled from the stage by event organizers after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night.

> During the event, Patel&#039;s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City-including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood-which AAA officials deemed inappropriate.

> &quot;While what some of the things that he said might have been a bit provoking to some of the audience, as someone who watches comedy a lot, none of them were jokes that I hadn&#039;t heard before and none of them were jokes that elicited such a response in my experience,&quot; Ferguson said.

"Is the ""controversy"" part of this real? The links actually look legit",Accomplished_Taco,"The most prestigious schools in the world are **Columbia SPS, Yale Law and Harvard Med**, in that order. These three are in a league of their own and completely overshadow all other schools. Together they are called the **Holy Trinity, or CYH**, of higher education, with Yale Law coming a close 2nd but struggling to match the sheer academic horsepower of Columbia SPS. Critics often point out that Harvard Med, being totally overrated simply because it has ""Harvard"" in its name, shouldn't even be included in the acronym. Some even go as far as saying that SPS should be in its own category because it has just dominated the world of higher education since its inception in 1995.

Every child in North America has heard of these schools; everyone and their uncle want to get in these schools. For my whole life, I have tried to understand all the hype around these schools. My dad went to Columbia. He told me what he remembered of Columbia SPS, a school which, in his mind held truth itself in its giant electronic fist. Since I was a child, the name Columbia SPS meant more than just a school, it's a faith, an obstinate and audacious hope. That's why I came to Columbia for undergrad. Many times I walked by the SPS building, I truly felt its palpable existence, the vigorous pulse, the every quiver of its beating heart screaming the very definition of excellence. It was my dream.

I spent my years working really hard and not really caring about grades all that much as long as I gave my best in everything. I bought all kinds of SPS merchandise. I slept in my SPS shirts because that made me feel closer to my dream. I spent a lot of time debating with friends and professors. I turned down invitations to social gatherings, thinking all the hard work would pay off someday and that those other people who went out so often would someday wish they'd studied as hard as I did. And one day, they will all look up to me to be the one student who gets to walk into the gate of Columbia SPS.

Well, I ended up with a 4.1 GPA, perfect GRE scores and all the academic awards that I could've possibly laid my hands on. But still, SPS rejected me. That, really hurt. When I received the rejection letter, it felt like a thousand knives stabbing right through my heart. Whether I fainted or not, I don't remember. Over the years, I kept asking myself, what I could have done differently, what I could have done better. Maybe if I did a little bit more, a little bit different, I would have had the big SPS letters on my resume. It hurts to know that despite all the work I put in, I wasn't able to achieve my lifelong ambition to attend a tippy top school like Columbia SPS. In the end, I settled with Yale Law. People did come and congratulate me. From their envious eyes I knew their admirations were real. I did get most things I wanted from Yale Law: respect, money, prestige. But deep down, I know, it is no Columbia SPS.

But now I am not that sad anymore. I have got over it. Some goals are never supposed to be accomplished. They only exist, because they constantly push people to be the better versions of themselves, to never give up dreaming and reaching for the best.

My cohort (again, can't speak for the others) is incredibly diverse, with students that come from all over the world. The professors are incredibly knowledgeable and the synergies between students is incredible. 

There are some negative points as well, don't get me wrong. Administration could use a lot of improvement, and some of the classes need to be tweaked. However over all, it's very good value for the money. 

For those who are saying Columbia is ruined could not be more wrong. The brand is still strong and earning a degree still means something to employers.

"Is the ""controversy"" part of this real? The links actually look legit",cugrad2019,"Yes - I've read the articles before and I have first hand experience with it. From my conversations with other international students, SPS (or other continuing education programs) are quite well known, not just in the US, but worldwide for being the cash cow program for universities to gain additional revenue - or in the case of Columbia, to fund their expensive ventures. However, there are also lots of professionals at SPS to boost their career-related knowledge so I won't write it off as useless or anything. I don't think SPS has the same level of access to Columbia resources, for example, they don't have access to the alumni directory as far as I know. I also don't think it would hurt the brand name as much, to be honest, as many other schools are doing the same thing. But I definitely am aware that other masters students might be negatively affected by SPS' reputation overseas. Harvard and Penn both have bachelor's granting schools that are much less selective and rigorous than GS (which I think is the best program of its kind - I was CC). You can even do a bachelors degree online now at Penn, for example, without having to go to class in person. They are of course, not without controversies, but I think Columbia's liberality in churning out masters degrees is a whole new level. Like now they're creating a climate school?

SPS, TC, GSAS, SIPA, SEAS etc all offer master's programs that are insanely easy to gain admission to. Most of these programs have 90%+ Indians/Chinese. The MA in statistics has been notorious in China for more than a decade now. Ask any Chinese person and they will tell you this. With all kinds of master's programs pumped out from this school now people just can't tell them apart anymore.

Of course a very small group of better informed people will explain the difference between undergrad and master's programs in terms of selectivity, alumni connections, resources and general prestige in the U.S but most people don't understand this. Technically an MA/MS is a more advanced degree than a bachelor's so they just assume that Columbia undergrad is even easier to get into. Some people will argue that all other schools have similar cash cow programs and it's not just Columbia. Sure, but no school has as many of them as Columbia and enrolls as many master's students as Columbia. Not a single one. Watch all the campus interviews on Columbia students on Youtube. 90% of students here are master's students. The interviewers literally could not find a single undergrad to answer some questions.

It is just a fact that masters programs and undergrad are completely different things. For example, you are NOT considered an ivy league student just because you go to a master's program (or any graduate school unless you also go there for undergrad; AAMOF, at Harvard Law, students who didn't go to an ivy league for undergrad are referred to as ""non-ivy Harvard students"" by our school senate), and you will NOT have access to the same resources and opportunities as an undergrad, such as exclusive job fairs, OCIs, internal alum connections, legacy status for your offspring and many of the privileges and benefits that are often associated with the an ivy league degree. It is just a fact. If you try to deny that, you really need to research more about this and just get over it. Now, nobody is making a claim that ALL master's programs are cash cows that anyone with money can get in. We are saying A LOT of them have low admissions standards, regardless what school/department these programs are in. Are there ""masters-level programs with competitive admissions""? Sure. But very very few. Graduate admissions at even the best graduate schools/programs are no where as grueling as the undergraduate admissions process, where the odds are incredibly slim given the sheer number of applicants. Case in point, the all prestigious Columbia Law School has 15% admissions rate whereas the undergrad has less than 6%, let alone masters. As far as I know, at SEAS the only reputable master's program is the MS in Financial Engineering, the rest like Operations Research, Business Analytics and data science are notorious for having overly-generous admissions standards. If you don't believe me, you can look this up on wallstreetoasis and see what people think of these programs. But let's be honest, even at MS in Financial Engineering, how many of the students are ivy league undergrads, and how many of them could have gotten into Columbia for undergrad? If you were in an SEAS masters, you should know. However, what is special about Columbia is that it offers programs that anyone with a beating pulse and a fat wallet can get in. To name a few: all SPS programs, MA in stats, MS in Electrical Engineering, most TC programs, most SIPA programs. These are what we mean by ""cash cow"" programs that are hurting the Columbia reputation. Also, a friendly reminder, in your flair you listed ""SEAS'20"", I hope you graduated from SEAS undergrad class of 2020 since that is what ""SEAS'20"" exclusively refers too.

"Is the ""controversy"" part of this real? The links actually look legit",Lopsided_Mastodon_10,"I agree with you on the facts here, but I don't agree that the university brand is still intact. It is true that the most selective jobs such as those at prestigious investment banking and consulting firms do view undergrads separately from their master's and master's students for the most part don't have a shot as these places. It is also true that master's degrees are considered much less a sign of accomplishment than undergrad in Asia among those ""in the know""(though I will qualify this by saying this ""undergrad pedigree"" thing only exists in the finance and consulting industries as far as I know). But the strength of a university brand doesn't depend on the upper echelon of it though does it? The vast majority of jobs exist outside of MBB and top IBD where 90% of Columbia undergrads don't get those jobs either. Most companies do not have the luxury to select candidates from the most talented pool (like prestigious undergrad, or MBA only) and to them the value of a master's degree and bachelor's becomes a lot harder to parse, and those are the jobs the majority of undergrads get. The overflow of master's degrees in the job market will certainly hurt the perception of the Columbia name among the less elite employers, and the large middle ground of Columbia undergrads is the most vulnerable to this effect. For now though the very best students at CC or SEAS will still do just fine, I cannot say the same for an average one. Also you mentioned that Harvard, MIT, JHU, OXford, and many other T-20 schools offer similar cash cow programs. True, but no one is nearly as brazen Columbia in creating this many of them.

"Is the ""controversy"" part of this real? The links actually look legit",cugrad2019,"Right. Also, are we talking about, like, job market in the states or over yonder in Asia? I think the dynamics might be different in the two job markets. I have friends in CC/SEAS/GS (and grad schools too) who have absolutely zero problem landing jobs in Asia Pacific (HK in particular) and according to a survey I read a while ago, Columbia is the most represented school in finance in China (and HK too) by a good margin and HK is, without doubt, one of the most important financial hubs in Asia that far eclipses Taipei. I am not sure about how recruitment works with ""less elite"" employers but it doesn't seem to me that a company would automatically toss out your resume or give you a much harder time just because you did your masters at CU - if they do, that's a major red flag about the company and speaks volumes of their *questionable* ethics and work culture and is usually one I would not even apply to - and probably such insular worldview explains why the company is ""less elite"" in the first place. I share the exact same concern as you do and I think the university should do something about all those cash cow programs, but I still disagree on the direct and mid-to-long term impact on undergrad employability as there is zero direct evidence either from hearsay or any verifiable source that such thing has been happening on a massive scale. Also by referencing people ""in the know"", I am talking about heads of major companies, C-suite executives, media and entertainment celebrities, and other important people (like Forbes or Hurun-listed) who are inclined to (or have already sent) send their children to Columbia, who significantly contributes to the school's finances (so that Columbia would no longer need cash cow programs to support its operations) and help advance its reputation in elite circles in Asia-Pacific. I would envision, however, a scenario in which ""employability"" becomes a major factor in Columbia's global rankings, from which it would have taken a serious hit, and pushes the administration to think about how it should revamp its admissions practices. So far, I have not seen that happen yet as a lot of those global rankings favor research output over career outcomes and academic reputation over ""job reputation"" or some vague criteria as you have mentioned.

You seem to have no basic understanding of logic so let me teach you a master's class, and unlike the ones at Columbia, this won't burn a whole in your wallet. Lots of filtering does happen from the time high schoolers applying to college to college students applying to master's programs, which winnows out those students going to elite jobs (top IBD, consulting, high tech engineering etc), top PhD programs in almost all fields, prestigious professional schools, leaving mostly the middling bunch much like yourself who has no shot at any of the above coming out of college competing for rubber stamp programs that charge 100K a year for a mediocre education and childhood ivy fantasies. Furthermore, the competition is even further diluted by the fact that a school usually offers various similar programs that essentially aim for the same job market. Case in point, there are tons of ""quantitative programs"" even at Columbia alone: MS in Financial Engineering, MA in financial Math, MS in Operations Research, MA in statistics, MA in Quantitative Methods for Social Sciences, MS in Business Analytics, MS in Data Science, MS in Financial Economics and many of the quasi quant quasi business programs from SPS... I can go on and on. When programs are offered in a same school, which is the case for most of the programs mentioned above, you cannot apply to them at the same time. What this means is that applicants who think they have a shot at MSFE will not apply to MSOR and those who aim to get in MSFN will not apply to MS in stats. With the mass exodus of talents, programs such as MS in stats still manage to bring in a 500 people class every single year.

"Is the ""controversy"" part of this real? The links actually look legit",cugrad2019,"Right - I agree totally with you. (PS: also Zhihu is not so reliable a source because there are so many government trolls spewing false information) But I think calling its reputation ""ruined"" or ""destroyed"" is quite an exaggeration from the mere evidence on online posts and I doubt that is has become a hard-established ""fact"" but definitely a recent trend worthy of our concerns. I'm surprised no grad student has written more about this on spec, or even raised concerns at Senate meetings. Apparently, the reason why so many of those programs are flourishing is because each school's (and even departments too) adcom and administration is independent from one another. Also their budgets are independent so they must do their best to survive so you'd see the more cash-strapped departments, especially GSAS, setting up all those cash cow programs to sustain operations of CC and hiring of new faculty. A few of my friends actually wrote an Op-ed back in the day telling SEAS to cut down its graduate student enrollment because it's negatively impacting the undergrad experience. I don't know if they've listened, but I think the over-enrollment of SEAS undergrads through the 3+2 program was the tipping point that many alums voiced strong concerns, and raised an eyebrow from higher ups, finally clamping down on the ""backdoor"" issue. Another reason is that SEAS has raised enough money to sustain its own operations (really major turnaround under Dean Boyce as evident in the new facilities and major surge in engineering rankings) so it no longer needs the 3+2 program for funds (truth is that almost no aid is given to 3+2 students). If they can do that, I'm sure more active steps would be taken to reinforce the reputation and selectivity of the institution itself. I also think that one of the reasons is the building of Manhattanville and PrezBo's many flashy ventures are straining the resources of the institution, putting GSAS especially on the back burner. One of the reasons Columbia's endowment hasn't grown as much is mainly because of the building of the new campus, which costs A LOT of money, like 2/3 of the school's present endowment. Also the school spends a lot on faculty salaries and research so that it punches beyond its weight with such little endowment compared to its peers. Other schools with Columbia-level endowment (especially Northwestern, Notre Dame, Penn etc.) are expanding, but not to such an extent of building an entirely new campus on the island of Manhattan (arguably the one place in the world with the most expensive real estate that comes with lots of legal complications), and similarly are they not offering the same level of salary to attract top-notch faculty (in terms of professors' salary, Columbia's in the league of Harvard and Stanford).",2,,1595222476.0,fymbl4r,False,False,1595211617.0,2020-07-19 21:20:17

Columbia is trying to lure international students and get their money by saying that they'll be hybrid,  but it's almost certain that the second wave of Covid-19  will cause Columbia, a school in the epicenter of the pandemic in New York, to shut down on-campus classes and go completely online. In the case of this highly likely scenario, international students would lose their visas and be deported within 10 days. What makes the situation even worse is that when the second wave of Covid-19 hits, it will be much deadlier than what we saw in the last few months due to the start of flu season in the U.S., and travel restrictions could be placed in both the United States and other countries (including China). At that time, international students will become temporarily stranded and be in limbo (with their visas revoked) until their home countries send charter flights or military ships. 

Under these circumstances, the best advice I can give you is to not endanger your lives, which is the most precious gift from your parents.

I cheated by looking up lab solutions by different people who previously posted their code on Github, and using some brief parts of them (it's surprising how many AP solutions are online lol). No blatant copying line by line, but short parts had similar logic. I honestly tried to change them as much as possible from the online code, so it's impressive that he caught me. 

I was really surprised that my punishment was only a half-letter grade deduction from B- to a C+. That was reached because once Jae sent his email, I completely admitted what I did and took full responsibility. (Advice to anyone who gets caught: Admit completely right away!)

I do feel like I had a good coding experience prior to starting AP! I'm a pretty competent coder I would say. I just didn't put in as many hours into AP as I should have, and it definitely caught up with me over time. I think that I could've succeeded had I put in the effort every day from the beginning. But at the point that I did cheat, I was certainly going to get a 0 on those labs.

I absolutely have no bad feelings toward Jae! In fact, I think he's an absolute legend and incredible teacher. His curriculum is certainly doable if you put in the hours, and I just didn't put in the hours until it was too late. Not sure how it could be changed.

I took AP because I'm a CS major, so it's required. I definitely learned a ton from the labs that I did honest work on.

I'm continuing the CS major, so CS Theory, Fundamentals of Computer Systems, etc.

1. Admit everything you cheated on this semester and who you did it with. If you tell a half-truth, you will face maximum disciplinary action.

I'm pretty confident that as soon as you get a little bit behind, you're screwed. It's easy to get by early on by saying ""well, it's just logic, and I'm fairly smart, so I should be able to figure shit out"" -- but that's really not the case. In order to really ""get it"" you need to internalize why things work the way they work.

Got caught cheating in AP and lived to tell the tale. AMA.,Drach88,"* Practice reading code line by line and drawing out what the memory looks like. This should start really, really early on, so it becomes an acquired and practiced skill. This is how you learn to get through the exams quickly and accurately, and it helps tremendously for planning out the labs and debugging your code.

* Practice the ""mechanics"" of coding to learn to do everything faster through repetition and muscle memory. A lot of time is wasted trying to figure out how things in the editor work rather than actually doing the coding. Almost treat simple coding exercises like sports ""drills"" rather than intellectual challenges. This goes for general navigation around the command line, use of your editor, make etc. Spend time making your development workflow more efficient. Best case scenario, you save time and learn things. Worst case scenario, you just learn things.

* Practice reading arbitrary man pages. So much of coding in C is just a matter of being able to do the research to understand what a function does. Reading man pages is a practicable skill in-and-of itself. All man pages for functions should boil down to arguments, return value and ""side-effects"". Once you can do that, understanding how arbitrary functions work becomes really simple.

* Practice debugging skills. This includes the mechanics of putting together arbitrary debugging print statements in key locations around your code. It also includes learning how to read compiler errors, and trace your call stack.

* Get out of the habit of saving old or unworking code in the comments. You get better by forcing yourself to re-write code. For that matter, don't be afraid to refactor your code as soon as you think it's getting too complex or unwieldy. A lot of debugging trouble happens simply because spaghetti-code is too difficult to follow mentally.

* Start all of the labs the day you get them, and intend to hand them in at least two days before they're due. Go to office hours, even if you don't think you need to. Discuss concepts with classmates and see if you can teach concepts to classmates. Teaching reinforces learning.

* Don't cheat.",13,,False,fhf35k2,False,False,1581535260.0,2020-02-12 13:21:00

U.S. (Massachusetts) White Male

SAT: Currently 1450, 17/24 Essay. Took the SAT two days ago and am expecting a significant (50+) score increase.

Edit: GOT A 1570 YOOOOOOOOOOO! I apparently omitted 1 (1) math question but aced literally everything else, except the essay which I got a 16/24 on :/

ACT 33, 10/12 on all Essay sections

Subject Tests: U.S. History 780, Math II 720, Chem 690 (Will be retaking one of the latter two)

Curriculum: All honors and AP through junior year (5 on World and US History). I am taking 4 APs (GoPO, BC Calc, Spanish Lang, and Bio) this year, 1st semester honors English and 2nd semester CPA English (could not find an honors English for semester 2).

Cumulative GPA: As of junior year, unweighted 94.44/100, weighted 99.04/100

ECs (Apprehensive because they don't exactly look world-renowned)

1. I work as a food server at an elderly retirement community, think waiter but without tips, between 9-13 hours a week after school. I have held this job for a year now and intend on keeping it through senior year.
2. I volunteered at a local hospital for 50 hours last summer.

3. IDK if this counts as an extracurricular, but these did have significant outside of school involvement:
Honors Science (Physics, Bio, Chem) at my school requires a year long independent research project to be 
completed, with a project board, paper, abstract, and research notebook. I received a B on physics and two A's for the other two. These are all the results of months of preliminary research, experimentation, and analysis that represent intense time commitment.

4. I attend a church youth group. Because I am a senior this means I will be a leader...

5. Sports: I did Cross Country in 9th and 10th grade and track in 9th grade.

6. Hobbies/Superficial Things:

I play Magic: the Gathering Commander at my LGS weekly.

I run with Central Mass Striders weekly.

I attended the schools Gamer's club through sophomore year. 

Awards: I received the Clarkson University Academic Achievement Award in junior year.

Recommendations: One from my APUSH and one from my Chemistry teachers. I believe they are reasonably decent.

Personal Statement: I am choosing the last prompt to elaborate more on the significance of my experiences at work, volunteering, and school as a balancing act with my less than world-class hobbies.

Columbia Specific Stuff: I am strongly considering Columbia not necessarily because of any prestige, but because of its unique Core Curriculum in a unique city that I believe will be formative in a classical pre-med education.

I know that my resume is not exactly showstopping in the extracurricular department. I am fully aware that grades and test scores just clear certain filters in the admissions processes for highly selective schools like Columbia. I am considering either ED'ing Columbia or Bowdoin. I know the two are wildly different schools, and I greatly appreciate any insight you could give me into applying here as a reach.

Demographics: Asian female, my dad is retired but when he worked he made around $150k so I don’t know how that works out, live in the Mid Atlantic area (close to DC). School isn’t that competitive, and I live in an upper middle class neighborhood. I have a sister that went to Yale and another sister that’s a sophomore in high school.

GPA: 4.4 (weighted, out of 4.5, I don’t know what my unweighted GPA is because it our school doesn’t do that?)

Classes:
-11 APs total 
(AP Gov, AP Chem, AP Bio, AP Lit, AP Lang, AP Chinese, AP French, AP Calc BC, AP Stats, APUSH, AP Psych) 
(5 on everything except APUSH and AP Chem (4s)). 
-I also took IGSCEs during my freshman and sophomore year.

Rank: 2/343, so top 1%? I go to a school with about 1200 students.

SATS: I got a 1170 on the PSATS freshman year and that bothered me so I studied a lot and ended up getting a 1560 on the SATS (junior year). Also took the Math 2 Subject test and I got a 800. 

Sports: 
-varsity softball since freshman year. co captain this year. 
-ice skate but more as a hobby.

Clubs: 
-art club
-orchestra
-band
-color guard (yes I’m in all three)
-BPA
-science olympiad
-NHS

Extracurriculars: 
-Been playing and taking piano lessons since second grade (so 11ish years?)
-art lessons for about 9 years
-going to Chinese school for 13 years.

Leadership:
-captain of my color guard 
-first chair cello in orchestra
-secretary of my BPA chapter

(I think my leadership is a little weak?)

Volunteering: I’ve volunteered at my Chinese school for 3 years being a TA (grading homework etc) and I also volunteer at various Chinese festivals they do. I think that’s it though (Will this hurt me?? I don’t have a lot of time to do volunteer stuff)

Awards: 
-placed nationally for BPA (for all five years i’ve been in the club so far) 

-gotten good “grades” in piano competitions for five years (hard to explain but it’s basically where the judges judge how well you play)
-placed for science olympiad at states but our school didn’t do well enough so we couldn’t go to nats. 

-went to this like program that our governor does for students that do well in art/academics (I went for art because I liked it better). 

-some other smaller art awards (state) 

Major: I want to be a business major but I’m pretty sure Columbia doesn’t offer that so maybe Econ of some sort?

So I'm statistically in the lower pool of applicants. My GPA is a 4.4 (4.0 unweighted) but my SAT score is a 1320 (710 EBRW and 610 Math). The math score is because I was never really a great student in middle school (I also taught myself 8th grade and 3/4 of freshman year) so my fundamentals were a little shaky. Digressing, my AP scores were: 

AP Lang - 5 

APUSH - 5 

AP Physics I - 3 

On top of that, I participated in a state selective internship (200/2400 selected) and worked with an alumni at my highschool for a film she directed I've got some other pretty solid extracurriculars (2 varsity sports, Art honor society for Photography, studied Music Production at Harvard last summer) . I also have a Columbia alum writing one of my letters. 

The SAT score is something I'm really worried about. I want to apply ED because I feel like my chances are better but feel like test score wise, I'm on the weaker side. I take Physics and Math I tests in November and am wondering if it is worth studying my ass off for another SAT and applying regular decision.

Curious about your chances? Ask about admissions here!,lightsallfaded,"Thanks for reviewing my chances! I originally intended one applying to CC as a CS major, but then I discovered the CS-Math major. Based on the (limited) information on the website, CS-Math intrigues me because it combines two subjects that interest me. However, I'm definitely no math genius and consider myself pretty average at math, so I am worried about the difficulty of the major and its relevance to my career aspirations.

I definitely want to pursue a career in the CS field. My current plan is to go into AI and my dream job is to develop on game AI programs, like Google's AlphaGo. My plans are flexible though, and I am considering other pathways such as software developer/engineering or cybersecurity. I currently am not planning on going to grad school, though I realize a masters may be necessary for some of the career paths I mentioned.

- What exactly does CS-Math entail and how is it different from regular CS?
- Is the math involved in this major more similar to pure math or applied math?
- What type of jobs does CS-Math usually lead to?
Based on my experience and aspirations, which major do you think would be best for me?

Curious about your chances? Ask about admissions here!,heroic_ohrice,"Joint majors like CS-Math are essentially a combination of the foundational courses and a few electives from each major (so think 50/50 CS and math). The CS major would have you take the foundational courses and electives pertaining to a specific track (e.g. visions and graphics, intelligent systems). If you are really interested in AI, I would suggest doing the CS major so you can pursue the intelligent systems track. You could always just do a math minor as well. The problem with joint majors is that you don't get in-depth knowledge of the disciplines you are studying.

I don't think it would be difficult to write your application essays if you choose the joint major though. It seems suitable given your aspirations. Admissions officers know that rising seniors might not have a clear idea of what they would like to major in (a problem encountered by some first years or sophomores!), but I think you have a clear direction.

I applied to SEAS knowing I'd go into BME because I loved bio/did research in BME/math team (p Azn if you ask me lolol), but I think for Columbia especially you need to also make sure you yourself have an open enough mind to explore other subjects as well, since even in the Eng school, a lot of your time is spent studying the humanities and social sciences (the Core!). If you ask a real student, they might bitch about lit hum (as I did), but you need to be able to stomach it. For the admissions committee, you need to convince them that you can also take on heavy readings/might actually be interested!  I read a lot as a past-time about a lot of eclectic subjects (reading about how to read, Murakami novels, etc). 

I would refrain from putting down something for the sake of putting down something! I think what I'm getting at is that putting undecided isn't bad--in fact, it can be an advantage. A lot of students come in not really knowing what they want to do. Or knowing what they want to do and very quickly being charmed away by another major. Or you could be like me, doing BME till the very end. If you're in category 3 (me, haha), make sure that you yourself can enjoy or at least stomach humanities classes. Otherwise, Columbia might not be the best place for you. I don't think you fall in this category though.

I don't believe that campus rape is an epidemic and I actually believe that Columbia is probably a much safer school than others in terms of rape occurrences.

I'll also believe that nobody has definitive proof about the rape case on either side. It's all a word of mouth sort of thing. You are free to believe or disbelieve whoever you'd like, and I cannot prove that you are right or wrong.

Thus, I equate those who vehemently support Emma (to the point of wishing violence against Paul) as equal to those who do vehemently support Paul (to the point of calling her a crazy cunt.) Both sides exhibit unsubstantiated radicalism.

I don't think Emma is crazy. I think she may be telling the truth. Her art piece is crazy, but that is the nature of evocative performance art.

Columbia University sued by male student in ‘Carry that Weight’ rape case,weaverwasher,"So I don't hang out with activists (not really a huge activist spirit in the CS department) but most of us have been skeptical of Emma's story ever since the Facebook messages between them seemed to tell a different story than the one is presenting. Among my friend group no one would disagree with Paul's rationale behind his lawsuit--that Columbia is complicit in allowing him to be harassed and abused. 

There's a very vocal minority on this topic--see No Red Tape--who use skit-like activism to draw attention to their plight. Most people don't discuss sexual assault every day and are largely embarrassed by the negative attention that this whole ordeal is bringing to Columbia. Personally, I think that all matters regarding a specific alleged rapist should be kept private and that the university should punish public accusations of rape directed at a specific person. This should be an entirely private matter. ",6,,False,cqose9j,False,False,1430012997.0,2015-04-25 20:49:57
Columbia University sued by male student in ‘Carry that Weight’ rape case,Kritios_Boy,"I'll chime in here. I'm a senior at Columbia, and I've met Paul and still know Emma. I also know a number of people involved in the SJW movement on campus.

There is clearly a more vocal portion of the population that supports Emma. I think for many this has more to do with politics and less to do with the actual case.

I do think that most undergraduates support the idea of sexual respect and a more fair/robust disciplinary process for people on both sides of these cases. Unsurprisingly, Columbia botched the idea by implementing a poorly received sexual respect workshop series. 

Paul supporters, who I believe are a minority on campus, have only recently become vocal. They definitely exist, but due to the general sentiments and politics of the campus as a whole, have chosen to stay silent.

Many people on both sides are becoming frustrated with the campus activist movement as a whole, mostly regarding No Red Tape. Their actions are radical and intrusive, especially the recent ""rape happens here"" light projection on low library. They are admittedly very good at what they do and highly effective at making change on campus, some of which is good.

I think the people writing it tried to make a point that pumping out products before they're ready is a problem endemic only to China, but I would have to disagree. Faulty products are pumped out everywhere, all the time, and in America corporations actively take advantage of the consumer (i.e. the pharmaceutical industry way overcharging for life-saving prescription drugs). This is just getting more coverage because China is enemy #1 right now and because the virus originated in China.

Again, to your second paragraph, I see no evidence that this is intentional or malicious, if you have any, feel free to share.  Clearly a quality control problem, for which the Chinese government is clearly at fault, but again, I don't see how you can argue in good faith that this problem is unique to China.

Columbia has stress culture. The school's mental health resources are overloaded, so people cant get the help they might need. There is a stigma around mental health issues, so people go untreated or never get diagnosed. Lack of sleep from constantly studying/working probably drives mental health disorders flaring up. Top students discover that they are no longer the top students any more, and it can affect their confidence. People are away from home and support resources for the first time in a big unfamiliar city. The school is fucking small and cramped. Students fail classes or do poorly for the first time in their lives. People cant balance their social life and school lives and lose control. Substance abuse. Cultural/familial pressures. Worrying about losing scholarships/paying for school.

I often feel extremely isolated and incompatible with my peers. Finding friends that have similar interests as me has been a real challenge.

Thankfully, the more I work at it, the more comfortable I am with my position. I know what I need to do to get over my shortcomings. And I know I have people around me who care and who I can reach out to if I only try. But this doesn't always stop the frustration and the melancholy.

But to your question about whether I want the video linked at all on this subreddit..

&nbsp;

This subreddit seems to mainly be used by prospective Columbia students to ask questions and learn more about the school.

It saddens me that the top post on this subreddit right now is not a link to all of the great research and scientific discovery happening on campus (which there is a lot), but a link to pornographic art. And not just any pornographic art, but a piece that would be extremely triggering to anyone who is affected by rape and sexual violence, whether it happened to them personally or someone they know.

However, as mentioned by /u/fleshhook, I admit this is newsworthy and relevant to anyone who has been following the conversation about sexual and intimate partner violence on campus.

Thus, I'd prefer if any links directly to the video were taken down, and instead we allow links to articles being written about it in the media, like [spec](http://columbiaspectator.com/news/2015/06/05/sulkowicz-films-herself-violent-sex-scene-newest-art-project) or now even [buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/maryanngeorgantopoulos/part-of-emma-sulkowiczs-latest-art-project-disabled-by-cyber)

How do you afford master's degrees at Columbia? Since no financial aid is given by the university,Silver_kitty,"Loans, loans, loans. 

FAFSA doesn’t really “cover” anything unless you’re still eligible for grants that you didn’t take during undergrad (I don’t even know what they would be though, I know I couldn’t get any). It mostly determines if you qualify for the “good” loans - Graduate Plus loans rather than having to take private loans

I ended up with ~$90k in loans for my master’s. It was “worth it” for me because I got my dream job thanks to it.

But most Canadian universities other than McGill, Waterloo, and UofT aren't really known in America. Nonetheless it is accredited by Engineers Canada/CEAB and therefore recognized by ABET. I heard of the Columbia MS in Mechanical Engineering program being more than less of a cash cow program. My plan is to commission into the American military in my penultimate year of my prospective master's and I know the starting salary of a O-1 officer (even with flight bonuses) is not reflective of paying back a \~100k debt for a master's degree in a timely manner. However, my long term goal of being an astronaut requires multiple degrees and the master's degree is the new bare minimum requirement. I think that I would be fine with a relatively cheaper and equally great Purdue or Georgia Tech MS degree, and later having the US Navy or US Air Force paying for another master's degree, or using funding for a Ph.D. I want to go into the military with a MS in hand so that I don't have to stress about obtaining one while on active duty, To be honest, the only master's degree I would be okay with dropping about 100k on would be one from MIT.. maybe Stanford (but that's assuming I even get in there).",2,,False,futhwv3,True,False,1592156809.0,2020-06-14 12:46:49

How do you afford master's degrees at Columbia? Since no financial aid is given by the university,Silver_kitty,"Hmm, there *might* be some grants then, but they’d be to the tune of maybe $5k per year. Mostly you want to take the full $20.5k in Unsubsized and the rest in Plus loans. 

And yeah, I was in engineering too (forensic structural engineering). That was my cost for 3 semesters and included a bit of “living expenses”, but wouldn’t have been enough to rent and such on. 

In the engineering school, a master’s is 30 credits (10 courses) which can be done in two punishing semesters of 5 classes at a time, or spread into a calmer 3 which is what I did and would highly recommend (4-4-2, so over the summer after you’ve already taken 8 grad level courses, you can get a good internship and if it goes well you can stay part time at the internship while you take the last 2 classes. I got my full time position this way and it was great.)

If you want a doctorate, the magic trick at Columbia is actually to do an EngSciD. The programs are exactly the same and it’s still a doctorate from Columbia. But the engineering school has a separate pool of money that it funds EngSciD candidates from, while PhD candidates even in the engineering school are funded by the University, and thus get less money.",5,,False,fusxk1x,False,False,1592145344.0,2020-06-14 09:35:44

Feeling alone and without real friends,JimmyThreeTrees,"Hey man, you don't come off as needy or desperate. I can offer some advice as a current grad student here who's been there before. Situation was different since my undergrad wasn't here but I hope my advice can help a bit. 

I went to a state school for undergrad, and unfortunately, the majority of people there go back home for the weekends. Campus was stem heavy (less socialization) and weekends were pretty much dead. It took some time (I'm talking like sophomore/junior year) for me personally since I'm more of an introvert who takes time putting myself out there. It's easy to fake being extroverted, but you're pretty much screaming internally if you're uncomfortable where you are. Joining clubs sounds like a cliche answer, but honest to God that's what it took. Try to join clubs that you personally are interested in. Humanitarian Aid? Politics? Video Games? Fencing? Heck, try em all because the people there will likely share your same interests. Thing is though, you have to get out of your comfort zone. Talk to people, feel the vibe of the room, and take the prerogative to invite people out to get food or something after. If you keep interactions weekly to club meetings only, you don't really get close friendships from that. I can say that this personally worked for me, and some of those friends I still see after graduation when I go back home. 

In grad school making friends is hard here at Columbia. Everyone seems to be busy all the time with assignments and exams (myself included). Going to friend mixers on campus and meeting people through smaller classes helped me here. Helps when you're all 'going through the struggle' together haha.",2,,False,f6uuimb,False,False,1573169027.0,2019-11-07 17:23:47
Feeling alone and without real friends,opensourcenerd,"Get better friends. Hate to be the bearer of bad news,  they aren't actually your friends. Better to be alone for a while than to have emotional investments in people who are ambivalent about you. 

Friendships can't be forced. You can become more social and meet new groups of people, but a friendship isn't guaranteed. 



Tbh, most Columbia kids...especially the traditional undergrads..  are self-centered shitty and obnoxious humans. I don't know if it's the adderall or growing up in a social media driven world, but some wires definitely got crossed in the decent human department for a majority of these kids. 


Get outside of this school. Travel to brooklyn. Go to art shows, theatres, open mics. You'll have a better chance meeting human beings there as opposed to the drones here. 


Another nugget of wisdom. Actual friends are far and few between. Aquantaineces are like tinder dates. Easy to find. You can get along and have a good time. But there's no substance to those connections whatsoever.

Just Got Accepted to the GS Program,The_broken_machine,"I'm a vet in GS. Pro-tips:

1. The Post-9/11 GI Bill doesn't cover everything. The Yellow Ribbon Program doesn't even match the remainder, even at the $20,000 for the YRP and GI Bill combined.
2. You can still apply for grants and flippin' do it. The Pell Grant, VFW, etc. 
3. Do your disability claim ASAP. The extra income is good, don't shy away from it. At a 50% rating you also get free VA health insurance and as such, aren't required to buy health insurance from the school. And then you can apply for Chapter 31, or Vocational Rehabilitation. It covers ALL the costs (side from the medical insurance), buys your books for you at the Columbia book store AND the nearby indie store Book Culture. It can buy you a new laptop and other gear. If you don't have a DD-214 and you're still in the reserves, I'm actually unsure of what you can apply for in terms of the insurance.
4. The BAH is prorated. Meaning months like December and January, when you're not in class for a full month, you get a partial payment based on how many days are active in the university's semester. I want to clarify weekends, autumn/fall break, and days you don't have scheduled classes will NOT count against you. Also, the VA pays you the E-5 with dependents rate for the zip code of your learning institute, and NYC has been lowered, LOWERED by about $800 a month by the DoD.

5. You know how crazy renting is here, as a native. My wife and I are considering moving up the Hudson and BUYING a house to commute in to save money. If you're a disabled veteran, there is a ""Fair Fare"" program that halves to costs of the MTA for you. Also, look into the Columbia Housing and where you can take a Columbia shuttle bus and commute in.

1). Contact [Columbia Housing](https://facilities.columbia.edu/housing/housing-registry) and get on their waiting list, you will have priority as you are an incoming student. This is usually a better option (and more affordable) than trying to find a place by yourself out in the city. Since you are married, you will qualify for couples housing.

2.) If you are eligible, look into VocRehab, it pays for 100% of your tuition. This is important since Columbia's tuition is very expensive and Post 9/11 plus Yellow Ribbon typically won't be enough to graduate on time.

Just Got Accepted to the GS Program,supdawwwwgwife,"Hey! Am an Army Vet at GS. 

If you are using post 9/11 GI, the GI Bill will cover most, if not all, of your first semester of the academic year. ~24000. GS is a yellow ribbon school and will match the VA’s 10000 the following semester (so around 20000). That leaves a couple thousand on the table. Do you FAFSA, and do it early,  and see if you are eligible for Pell Grants. FAFSA takes you W2 from two years ago, but if you write a letter for change in circumstance (like you will be unemployed), you should qualify, which will more than likely cover the rest. Finally there are federal loans that you can receive as well. 

When using your post 9/11, you will receive a housing stipend, depending on how many credits you are taking. It’s around 3600 per month (don’t quote me, it’s in that ball park tho). I have found that this is suitable for me to live comfortably, but my husband is also a veteran attending school in NJ. In NY, this money will not go too far, but I’m telling you now, living in NJ and going to NYC SUCKS. It’s seriously miserable, but cost of living is cheaper. Do a lot of research and figure out what the best housing arrangement would be for you.

Easy Dorm Room recipes,shandy3,"Heyo this is a great idea!! For those of us here that have to ball on a budget this would be super useful. One problem i’ve been having is buying ingredients and then just not using all of it or having too much and forgetting about it and it goes bad. So maybe stuff that freezes easily or which can be shopped for by the portion, or adding a little icon to categorize that way too

Some ideas
1. Grilled Cheese and tomato soup, but figure out a way to make the cheese cheaper 
2. Smoothies— mowi has frozen fruit for pretty cheap and it’s also easy to steal fruit from the dining halls. Yogurt/base is the only regular purchase
3. Ramen stir fry — get veggies and soy sauce and then just use regular top ramen as the base
4. Fried rice
5. Pasta w tomato olive oil and garlic (i just learned pasta can be cooked in a microwave?)
6. Channa Masala and rice
7. Pita pizza (again cheese is hard to shop for tho)
8. Tacos!! best with friends who each bring an ingredient

Keep in mind that groceries around here can be hella expensive. We have HMart which has good amt of stuff to spice it up so it's not bland, Mowi and Westside are standard bougie UWS digs but it's doable to shop there if you're buying small portions of veggies or basic stuff like pasta.

I did Thanksgiving, Christmas, birthday dinners with friends when I lived in Schapiro Hall. Definitely among my best college memories.

For low-income students like me, C-Town on 125th is a great option if you don't want to spend too much on groceries. It's further than Morton Williams and Westside, but much more affordable. You can get a good pork shoulder for about $1 -$1.50 per pound, some rice and beans, potatoes, pasta and make a whole bunch of meals for a week.

Our Electrical Engineering group used to hoard coconut flakes from John Jay to make macaroons for late-night stress baking sessions in Wallach/Hartley.

Off-Campus Living Allowance,thejordanrivers,"For plenty of people living off campus isn’t a privilege, it’s a necessity, whether due to an unstable and unhealthy home life or literal non existence of their own home, and many of those same folks are the ones who don’t have an extra 3000 to spend on living costs. Or people who have had to become the sole income source of their family due to COVID. And that’s assuming the whole 4000 is returned as a refund, but since most of us have 1500 in student contribution + summer work requirement, I assume most people will not be seeing the whole 4000. Normally when you don’t live on campus, your financial aid package is still calculated using the cost of if you were on campus, so it’s just a dramatic reduction in aid even compared to normal policy. 

Now I assume they calculated that assuming the average student wouldn’t have to pay rent or for their own food and would be living at home, but I think that’s actively ignoring the reality of so many students, especially since Columbia loves to brag about having low income students at the school but didn’t even seem to create some sort of extenuating situation policy to get an increased off-campus living allowance. 

Is it better than nothing? Sure. Will many students who have disposable income and don’t finance their own education find this to be perfectly fine? Sure.

Off-Campus Living Allowance,Quil0n,"I certainly agree, but I was assuming people who need to live on campus because they don't have a stable home life would choose to take on campus housing and thus receive the necessary financial aid. Judging from the 2021 Facebook group, a very vast majority of people who applied were approved. And I was under the impression that the summer grant covered the student summer contribution + on campus/remote semester student jobs will still exist? Don't see why those would end up being problematic.

Obviously this doesn't account for people who are working at home and don't have the ability to go to NYC. However, if you do end up being the only income source for your family due to relatives losing employment (which I would guess is relatively rare, even with the amount of low income students at Columbia), I don't see why you wouldn't appeal to the financial aid office.

Off-Campus Living Allowance,thejordanrivers,"Maybe I just haven't had the same experiences, because I had an incredibly difficult time getting an appeal two years in a row and getting transparent information from the department even before COVID. Perhaps most people aren't having these issues and that's great. But there aren't even enough work-study jobs normally for students who are eligible, so I can't imagine there will be enough for all the students who are remote. And hopefully, they will release another program like the summer grant for those who can't complete jobs, but there's no information on it yet. 

To me, the fact that some people fall through the cracks is the part that isn't good enough. We have so so much admin, but they can't think of what I don't think are crazy, albeit possibly outlier, scenarios when creating the plans and dispersing this information? Even if they didn't change anything but actually released info about the average success of appealing or talked about possible plans they were thinking about to help students be financially secure (like another grant to replace work for the school year), I likely wouldn't feel the same way. Harvard released their off-campus living amount when announcing the plans for the school year, and consistent information given on a reasonable timeline, in conjunction with academic decisions (because for me the two go together), without me having to constantly check websites and Reddit for updates since they don't email us these things, would just generally make the situation better even if the information didn't change.",5,,False,fz4geh3,True,False,1595619514.0,2020-07-24 14:38:34

Transparency and willingness to share their decision making process would go a long way in terms of making the admin more trustworthy. Even the consistencies in the finaid department are something that should be fixed, because if appeals are handled differently depending on who addresses them, there’s something wrong with the process.

My original point is simply that the reduced financial aid stipend for remote students shouldn’t deter people from trying to live with friends or by themselves anywhere off campus other than home. The numbers I listed above are for the UWS, but people can easily live in a different city or even just in a different borough of NYC.

freshman - feeling jaded :(,TheMoreOne,"I've attended a few (I'm older) different colleges.  They're all pretty cliquey early on.  A lot of it is due to most freshmen being pretty insecure people, not unlike yourself from what I'm gathering.  Once people have their group, they tend to stick to it with everything, because at one point they felt just like you do right now.

It does get better, especially as people mature.  Just be yourself, and the people you'd want to be friends with will naturally sort themselves out.  People are attracted to that.  You do have to make an honest active effort though and put yourself out there, going to events, study groups, good hygiene, etc.

freshman - feeling jaded :(,CandidColumbia,"""Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody's gonna die. Come watch T.V.?""

Life is amazing. We are little specs of consciousness trying to grasp this. All of this. We don't know what happened before we were born. We don't know what's gonna happen when we die. People who've lived centuries before us studied the universe, created tools in the process of doing so and made various predictions as to what all of this actually is. What's the purpose. Where did we come from. Who are we. Why do the things around us happen the way that they do? Is there a creator, a God? Multiple Gods? Are we in a simulation? Is this all an illusion?

Your guess is as good as mine. Nobody knows. I personally like to think of life as a constant stream of unknown. The more I learn about something, the less I actually know about it because there's just so many more questions to ask about it. We don't even know what we don't know. Quite the paradox. But I like it, it keeps me busy. Many others just get terrified by this and subscribe themself to a particular religion or self-validating social group for comfort, because it's just so much easier for us to live our lives and die happy instead of constantly worrying about our current state of existence and its purpose. Their choice.

Just like it's your choice to be concerned over something so trivial such as your social life.

Most of the time many people around you are predictable. A lot of people just say whatever they hear just because either a lot of people agree with it or it fits within their best interest. Alot of people are sheep. You're probably predictable too. You sound and, probably act like, the typical college kid that's finding his place in the world, coping with an early existential crisis and going through a depression phase. You're just like plenty of others who are going through the same emotions as you right now. I'm predictable too. I went through that phase too. Trust me, you, I, we're not that special. I still have a hard time dealing with this, but I'm getting better at not giving a fuck about things.

You do realize when we die (you will too, I can assure you), none of this really matters, right? None of it. Every ""success"" you had? Doesn't mean a thing. Getting into Columbia? The only paper you'll have to your name is your will at that point. Speaking of which, all the money you made? You won't be alive to use it, and chances are it will dissipate after several generations. Climate change? You won't get hurt by it, but probably the rest of the world is fixing it up and we'll eventually develop the technology to prolong our survival (not like it's really all that important). But there are some, if you want to look at it in this perspective, ""good"" things that come out of the fact that existence is random and meaningless. The most embarrassing occurrence in your life? Forgotten. Done. Nobody will remember it. Parents are disappointed with you? Who cares, they'll die eventually and you'll be living your own life. Literally any bad thing that happened in your life won't matter. 

This might seem counterintuitive since I've been using logic to eventually encourage you to just act out of your emotions, and I'm not sure if this just defeats the purpose and forces you to think logically from now on, but bare with me. **Just live this life. Just do it.** Do whatever the hell you want. Obviously some will try to stop you from doing *whatever* you want, but it's up to you on whether or not you want to fight against that. 

Which is why just because the things you do are meaningless, it doesn't mean you shouldn't do them. You wanna be a vegetable all day and do nothing? If it makes you happy, okay. Go work a 9-5 job in the future and forget about whatever I just said, indulge in your emotions. Or go build a super company, just cause you feel like it. Do it for the meme. Do it for love. Do it for humanity. Give yourself any reason you want to give yourself. You get to decide what to do with your life. I mean, you'll die one day, so why not just ride the wave until it happens?

This was dark and deep, so if you want a cleaner, more positive input, go watch this video to make yourself feel somewhat better:

As for the no-strike clause, it will most likely expire while we are still negotiating our first contract so it will not interfere with negotiations as much as some make it out to be.

I'd suggest pushing yourself until you feel like you're ahead of the material being covered in lecture, then it's smooth sailing.  Lectures turn into review, rather than trying to keep up with new material being thrown at you.  Everyone learns differently though.

Will Columbia have the same covid testing incapabilities as Penn?,mteret,"My understanding is Columbia has been testing frequently everyone on-campus or proximity since June. In addition tests in NYC are free & easy to access (except maybe I've heard there is long lines sometimes but with social distancing) in addition Columbia is giving test results within 72 hours.

If im honest I dont think they'll go virtual before classes start, there really just isnt any obvious or direct reason why they would make everything virtual right now because everything is sort of going according to plan.

New York has had much better testing that most other states in recent months, and just has better infrastructure for that right now.

I think there are a lot of reasons that we may switch to fully online, but I dont think testing capacity would be the sole thing that \~does us in\~.

Are you a transfer student / GS by any chance? That definitely makes it more difficult.

In any case, I know it’s clichéd but the best way to even make friends is to get food with them. Like when I mention all those people in my first comment, I’m not necessarily saying they’re close friends—but most people are willing to get food with you because they’d also rather not eat alone.

I guess the only advice I have is to maybe get food w people from your clubs more often, as that’s probably the easiest way to go about it.

And really, just because you eat w friends a lot doesn’t mean you won’t be sitting alone in dining halls too.

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

At this time of year, my predecessors traditionally have issued a message noting that during spring break many will be traveling abroad for research, teaching, and learning. Unfortunately, this year is different. In the context of the international reach of COVID-19, there is no choice but to outline restrictions on travel imposed by the spread of the virus. Further, as U.S. travel regulations for citizens of certain countries recently have been expanded, I must describe these as well.  

All Columbia affiliates are strongly urged to postpone any non-essential international travel. For students, all upcoming travel outside the United States organized, led, or financed by Columbia is suspended until further notice. 

Further, the Centers for Disease Control [(CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/student-foreign-travel.html) has issued guidance that institutes of higher education should “consider postponing or canceling student foreign exchange programs.” This advice is motivated in part by an awareness that, in the near future, “students may face unpredictable circumstances, travel restrictions, challenges in returning home or accessing health care while abroad.” Sharing that concern, I have asked the Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement to contact our students on study abroad programs and begin the process of determining the options for a safe and orderly return home.

As you know, the University has [restricted](https://provost.columbia.edu/news/update-columbias-response-coronavirus) all [Columbia Travel](https://globaltravel.columbia.edu/content/what-columbia-travel) to China, South Korea, and now Iran and Italy until further notice in light of the CDC’s [Level 3 Travel Warning](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wwwnc.cdc.gov_travel_notices_warning_coronavirus-2Dsouth-2Dkorea&d=DwMGaQ&c=G2MiLlal7SXE3PeSnG8W6_JBU6FcdVjSsBSbw6gcR0U&r=rDjgWI34i3arYhZHO3Ms-PFL0NQ56TxAeW1xVrxokO0&m=pVcKHOE6F6RGwMJTD2lDzyUImgPbwXWczwB9xt2VFDo&s=7sY6SSBJVDsv8BJKKJ8ba6C6f1HjcjJezDlnZncD32c&e=). Please contact [globaltravel@columbia.edu](mailto:globaltravel@columbia.edu) if you believe your trip warrants exemption from these restrictions. The CDC also has issued an [Alert Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.cdc.gov_coronavirus_2019-2Dncov_travelers_index.html&d=DwMGaQ&c=G2MiLlal7SXE3PeSnG8W6_JBU6FcdVjSsBSbw6gcR0U&r=rDjgWI34i3arYhZHO3Ms-PFL0NQ56TxAeW1xVrxokO0&m=pVcKHOE6F6RGwMJTD2lDzyUImgPbwXWczwB9xt2VFDo&s=G6BQnuHRuLL-vAIjJtKk1jl0Liy7jq9MxfuH4BfcHMA&e=) for Japan.

Persons who still must travel overseas should make every effort to stay up to date regarding often fast-changing governmental regulations, including Executive Orders and guidance issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of State, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Visa and entry restrictions have been placed on Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Myanmar, Sudan, and Tanzania in addition to Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.

Please be assured that active oversight and planning take place every day by a policy task force that consults closely with members of our University faculty who are leading research virologists and epidemiologists. Based on their expert guidance, as well as that of the CDC and the New York City and New York State health departments, the University’s core campuses continue to operate normally. 

Current circumstances manifestly are uncertain, just the kind of situation that can generate deep anxiety. It is important that all of us modulate our responses to be consistent with the facts and the best information on hand.

I close with appreciation for the professionalism and thoughtful calm that characterize how our community is grappling with difficult current pressures.

Sincerely,

Ira Katznelson

Very Sad Engineer,Hereforchickennugget,"Ok. I’ll offer you three perspectives and hopefully one or the other will make you feel better.

1. The idealistic perspective. I’m in SEAS and I genuinely see so many people (esp your more traditional majors) that are really passionate about furthering human knowledge and making the world better. The reason engineering is so hard is because it equips you to actually contribute to society, and catching up to thousands of years of progress is ridiculously challenging. No engineer I know (or very few) loves their classes and just gets so excited by quizzes. Most of my friends in SEAS are having exceptionally hard times, but their big picture dreams keep them going. You spend so much of your life at work, and if you think your job is useless and you hate it, that’s also just incredibly draining. 

2. The practical perspective. Tech jobs (I don’t just mean google/fb but technical jobs in general) pay so much better than finance when you take hours into account. Sure your IB friends may seem like they’re making a lot of money, but when you do the math its minimal wage per hour. If you worked that hard in tech, you could be making much more money. Tech jobs really set you up for a healthy work life balance (if that’s what you want) and work that’s relatively interesting and challenging.

3. If you want to do finance, go for it. Firms love engineers and they give you way more space for your GPA. If engineering is really not for you, you can always leave it and go to finance. You can’t go the other way around. You’ll still be working insane hours, but most the tasks you’ll be doing are relatively mindless.",25,,False,f80e4af,False,False,1574126867.0,2019-11-18 19:27:47
Very Sad Engineer,Megadragon9,"I came from your ""easier"" majors (business and economics) and switched into engineering (computer science) in my last year of undergrad due to passion. Went through sleepless nights catching up math/stats and other basic stuff. It's been 5 years since I've made that decision, and I've never regretted it, nor did I regret spending time in the ""easier"" major. It was an eye-opening experience.

It's more about whether you have the passion for what you're studying. One quiz doesn't speak too much about your passion. Acing it doesn't mean you have passion, **not** acing it doesn't mean you **don't** have passion. A measure of passion could be, do you voluntarily read/learn/talk about things from that field. Or given the same resources, are you able to learn faster and be able to connect the dots of seemingly irrelevant points in that field. I know it's a little abstract, and some people don't find their true passion until 40 or 50. So I suggest you try out different roles in different industries (internships or full-time) to see whether the application side of what you're studying really sparks your interests. Sometimes, crossing out options is making progress.",13,,False,f80evni,False,False,1574127383.0,2019-11-18 19:36:23

It's sometimes hilarious how many people have messaged me about switching over to my field, after in undergrad being jerks about me being a non-engineer.

I will say, the math and problem-solving skills you learn in engineering are pretty transferable, but you've also got to develop social skills and what I call normal human thinking skills.

"Having Fallen (Metaphorically) From Morningside Heights, Seeking Practical Advice",supdawwwwgwife,"Do you have health insurance under your parents still? It might be worth it to go to a non affiliate therapist/psychiatrist and begin treatment, somewhere you feel safe being honest. It might help to start taking meds too, which is a trial and error game, but finding the right ones make a huge difference.

These things take time, unfortunately. It took me a month and a half to be seen by a private provider, but it was worth it in the end. I am still struggling with depression at Columbia. I also recently had to drop a class, but it was a huge weight off my shoulders. So treatment isn’t always a catch all, but it helps with the dark thoughts, if that makes sense. 

My other thought would be to talk to your advisor. Let them know that you are struggling with depression, but leaving school is not an option (unless of course it is, which is good too). They can advocate for you when you are falling behind.

Finally, I just want you to know that you’re not alone in feeling this way. I felt this way my first two semesters, I still feel it now. Sometimes just going to class is a huge chore. It really weighs on me. I just keep telling myself it’s only a few more years. That’s it. Then it’s over. If you need to talk, I am here. I’m not on campus much, I live in NJ, but you can message me.

Try to keep your head up. I know it sucks, and it might be impossible sometimes. If you need to take medical leave, then do it. It doesn’t make you a failure, and you will certainly never be wrong prioritizing your well being.",8,,False,f50uknq,False,False,1571933091.0,2019-10-24 11:04:51

Your grades are not some referendum on your intelligence, potential, or your value as a human being, although they can feel that way, especially at a place like Columbia. My wonderful, genius sister failed out of an elite school in the Boston area. I took time away from a fancy liberal arts college. If you had met either one of us in high school, you would be shocked at the path we took to and through college. I (deeply!) understand that taking time off is a terrifying prospect, especially if your family isn't well off or able to support you financially, and it may or may not be a good idea for you.

Anyway, I'm a student again after years of working, and this place can absolutely feel overwhelming. Send me a message if you want to talk through what you are feeling-- I'm happy to share my uni, meet up with you, give you a hug, and offer some non-judgmental support. If anyone else on this thread feels similarly, the offer of meeting up for support stands. You are not alone!

Editing to add two things:

1. My sister's story has a happy ending, despite the fact that at the time, her academic struggles truly felt, for her, like the end of the world. She went back to a different, very prestigious school a few years later, and graduated with honors in computer science. She is happy, successful, and has a great job as an engineer. I mention this only because no matter what happens, you have options and a bright future. I promise.
2. If you do reach out, I'm happy to chat about my own struggles with anxiety and experiences with therapy and medication. Lexapro changed my life. I did not address my own issues with anxiety and general depression until my mid-twenties, and if you are able to start that journey with a psychiatrist or therapist now, you will not regret it.

You're taking the right steps and you're very much conscious about your issues, which is the first step to addressing them.

OP - like everyone said, feeling this way is totally normal, but also - politics and virtue signalling are probably ways that younger students are trying to carve out a social niche for themselves. When you're fresh out of high school and about to go through major personal changes, you don't really know who you are yet, you tend to go extra hard on the parts of yourself that you think you know. That probably accounts for what you're talking about.

There’s this funny line with mental health, like you’re encouraged and given the resources to advocate for your yourself, but in my own experience, it’s such an obstacle. Almost not worth the time and effort to pursue... I feel like jumping through hoops just to prove I’m miserable is so counterintuitive when I am literally unable to even get dressed in the morning lol.

Not a lot of friends here, zero close friends, and I'm only taking two classes (while working), so I don't feel like I have a right to feel overwhelmed. You're not alone. Finding space to meditate is helpful, even for just a short time each day/week. Finding a therapist you trust to talk to about anything, including suicidal thoughts (whether realized or not) is unnecessarily difficult but worth the time and effort. Taking some time off to travel or just decompress is great, if you can afford it. I just saw a comment special on HBO, 'The Great Depresh' by Gary Gulman.

The Surprising Path That Some Kids Take to the Ivy League,heroic_ohrice,"For those of you who can't read it:

*You’ve read a lot over the past year about kids who end up in the Ivy League because of their parents’ wealth and wiles, kids with obscene advantages. I’d like to introduce you to another kind of kid who landed there. Her name is Wadzanayi Mayiseni. She goes by Wadzi.*

*Before Wadzi, 19, arrived at Columbia University last month for a summer bridge program to prepare for her first year, she’d never been to the United States. She’d never left Africa. She’s from Zimbabwe, one of the poorest countries in the world, where her mother, who raised her without any help from her father, has been out of a steady job since Wadzi was 9.*

*When Wadzi was 12, she found out she had bone cancer, which meant not just chemotherapy but the amputation of most of her left leg. I asked her how, psychologically and emotionally, that changed her. She said it made her more determined.*

*“You’re not defined by the things that hold you back,” she told me. “You’re defined by how you rise above them.” She refused to be placed in classes for disabled children and later figured out how to get a scholarship to one of Zimbabwe’s most esteemed private high schools. Then she figured out how to translate that into the best college education possible.*

*She got help with that last part from the nonprofit* [*United Student Achievers Program*](http://www.edmattersafrica.org/united-students-achievers-program/)*, which for two decades has identified disadvantaged high school students of enormous promise in Zimbabwe, coached them through applying to top-notch colleges outside of their country and steered them toward futures they never imagined.*

*And by “disadvantaged,” I mean students who in some cases grew up herding livestock and in other cases were strangers to computers. I mean orphans: Largely because of the AIDS epidemic, about a third of Zimbabwe’s USAP students have lost both parents. I met one such student, Getrude Makurumidze, last year; by the time she was 9, her mother, father and 6-month-old sister had died from complications related to AIDS. She then bounced among the members of her extended family who could afford at a given moment to keep her. She nonetheless went on to graduate from Bryn Mawr and is now in medical school at Georgetown University.*

*There are USAP programs in other developing countries. They not only provide students with the guidance necessary to apply to foreign colleges but also help with application fees and financial aid forms. Zimbabwe’s USAP was the model and remains the gold standard. It has sent more than 400 students abroad, mostly to the United States, where the schools they’ve attended include Stanford, Harvard, Yale, M.I.T., the University of Chicago, Duke, Pomona — you name it. Many went on to earn Ph.D.s. Many became physicians. Six won Rhodes scholarships.* 

*That’s worth dwelling on for several reasons, starting with this one: Zimbabwe is the sort of place that President Trump had in mind when he* [*used a fecal epithet*](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/shithole-countries/580054/) *for poor, black and (to his thinking) worthless countries, but there is obviously great potential there, needing only to be recognized and nurtured. Countries don’t fall neatly into categories: good versus bad sources of immigrants. Reality is more complicated. Talent is universal.*

*For example, in another desperate part of Africa, Somaliland, there’s a remarkable school,* [*Abaarso*](http://www.abaarsoschool.org/)*, that Jonathan Starr, an American philanthropist, opened in 2009. It educates children in grades 7 through 12. Its alumni have been admitted to and received financial aid from Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Brown, M.I.T., Swarthmore.*

*Those institutions’ receptiveness is another reason I’m writing this. Yes, America’s richest colleges stay that way by giving* [*special consideration to families with the means to make big donations*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/03/13/he-investigated-how-rich-buy-their-way-into-elite-colleges-some-took-his-book-how-guide/)*. But they simultaneously* [*use some of their wealth*](https://www.businessinsider.com/us-colleges-most-financial-aid-ranked-2018-11#17-brown-university-9)*, if not quite enough, to educate students who cannot contribute a dime to their tuition.*

*Zimbabwe’s USAP is also the story of the difference that one person can make. It’s run by and was the brainchild of Rebecca Zeigler Mano, an American who married a Zimbabwean, moved to Zimbabwe and couldn’t just shrug off the country’s misery.*

*“There’s a big gap — a big chasm — between the talent that we have in Zimbabwe and the opportunities,” she said on the first of two occasions over the last 13 months when I spoke with her in New York. She returns frequently to America, in part to raise funds.*

*Her program has become so well known and widely respected in Zimbabwe that every year she gets 700 to 800 applications for about 35 spots. “I like to tell Harvard that we are more competitive than they are,” she said. Many of the applicants are from remote rural areas; she tirelessly crisscrosses the country to interview them.*

*She also builds networks in the United States for the students who come here, so that they have places to go on school breaks — they can’t afford to fly home — and so that there are people to help with things like sheets and blankets. At the start she didn’t factor in their entire array of needs and got reports that USAP students were sleeping on bare dormitory-room beds.*

*“She’s one of my life heroes,” said Bruce Wharton, who was the public-affairs officer in the American Embassy in Zimbabwe when USAP began. “I don’t know anybody who has done so much on an individual, personal level to make our world better.”*

*Her ambitions are expanding: She plans to open a USAP boarding school in Zimbabwe next year. Money permitting, it will give up to 50 Zimbabwean students their 11th- and 12th-grade educations, so that they’re in the best shape possible to thrive when they go to college abroad.*

*She told me that she also hoped that the school would give the kids a deeper investment in Zimbabwe. In her ideal scenario, they bring the knowledge that they’ve acquired in college back to a country with a shortage of leaders, of innovators, of hope.*

*Wadzi said that she could envision getting a medical degree in the United States, becoming a pediatric oncologist and then returning home to help children who confront medical scares like the one that she survived.*

*I asked her about her impressions of America so far. She mentioned a trip to see, up close, a world-famous landmark that was familiar from so many pictures: the Statue of Liberty.*

*“It was right in front of me,” she said. “I was awe-struck.”*

*“You know the crown represents seven continents?” she added, referring to the spikes that radiate from it. She was transfixed by the fact that an icon so central to one country would allude to all the others; by the generosity of that symbolism; by its inclusiveness. “I remember really smiling,” she told me, “because I felt a part of that.”*

*She said that the tablet that Lady Liberty holds brought to mind studying, learning, growing. That, too, made her smile. “I’m here for an education,” she said. “And there’s a statue embodying what I’ve come for.”*",12,,False,eykaztw,True,False,1567143198.0,2019-08-30 00:33:18

Leave of Absence,tym1221,"Hey, I’m a freshman who just took leave of absence few days ago. I was in your exact same situation, and I totally get it. We worked hard to finally study and meet new people in a beautiful campus, and most of them were taken away from us. I also lived in a complete opposite timezone which made online classes much worse.

I would strongly recommend you to take a leave if you believe it will benefit you in a long run. Personally, I had a mandatory military service I had to do anyway which made taking leave of absence much easier than other reasons.

However, one thing you would need to consider is a chance of losing guaranteed housing. As far as I’m aware, Columbia takes your guaranteed housing away when you return which may financially/psychologically impact you. I know there are some exceptions to this since military service was one of them.

As someone mentioned earlier, contact you advisor ASAP. If you are sure about taking a leave, you should definitely try to do so this week since it’s 90% tuition refund for third week and 80% for next week.

Leave of Absence,inrainbows26,"I've taken two leaves of absence for different reasons, one for mental health and the other for a death in my family. Different leaves have slightly different procedures but both are pretty easy to go through with, you just have to talk to your academic advisor about your options. As far as deadlines, leaves are much more flexible than you think. My first leave for mental health I took in late November, with the semester almost completely over, and remained on that leave at home for a year and a half. 

In my case there was zero pushback during the whole process of taking each leave; every step of the way was easily outlined by my academic advisor and it didn't feel difficult to do at all. Coming back after a leave can be a bit rough because Columbia is very disorganized in that regard (my id card wouldn't work for weeks, my student account wouldn't update so I couldn't register for classes until it was too late for some). But the overall boon to my mental well being was worth a couple weeks of a disorganized return.

I think your idea that it's a good life lesson to start college in this terrible way with no friends, alone and miserable makes no sense.

Hanging out with family is going to solve being lonely? I don't think so, family is no replacement for friends.

FOMO when going remote this semester?,ephedup,"As much as the university and some students pretend otherwise; an on campus outbreak seems quite likely to occur given the large number of students arriving from areas of high transmission, the lack of a bubble format, and the certainty that some students will not follow the social distancing guidelines (see the spectator article link).  The FOMO regarding socialization is fear about missing out on the ‘normal’ college socialization which won’t occur this year if you follow social distancing guidelines.  School has been unclear about what will happen in that situation as their plans mostly entail testing and quarantine individuals but I imagine a campus shutdown could occur.  If your home situation is tenable and your program allows, stay home and focus on your studies.  Sure zoom lectures may not be the same quality of instruction as in person offering in normal times but you’d be doing a lot of zoom lectures on campus anyways.  If you stay home you’ll be making a decision that helps protect health if NYC communities and you might also save some money.

The majority of people and businesses are adhering to all safety guidelines — face coverings, social distancing, sticking to small groups, etc. I’d wager things will only continue to somewhat relax as we enter the fall. Of course, this comes with the added risk of the “second wave”, but I have some confidence and trust that New Yorkers and students will continue to operate on high-caution; no one wants to go back to March or April.

If you want to come live in uptown Manhattan to be close to campus, even if most of your classes may be online, I’d say go for it. You’ll still be able to make a community if you study on campus or hang out on Low. You’re also not the only one in this predicament as there’s certainly other people looking to make connections in these trying times.

Does anyone else here feel really dumb...?,korben2600,"Yeah all the time. Especially when I took both 1004 and 3827 my first semester here. Talk about a reality check.

In my experience the CS department has a habit of targeting low averages on their exams and then curving. This is one of my biggest complaints here. It feels super defeating getting, for instance, a 32 on a midterm only to realize that was pretty much the average. Or, alternatively, during finals season it can be extremely stressful having no idea how you actually did until grades are finalized. I understand why they do it, however I don't believe it promotes healthy practices with students.

Do you often go to office hours? That's your biggest advantage here to get time in with the material and is something I didn't really make use of as much as I should have early on. Also, it can be helpful to find a small group to do HW with that you can bounce questions off of.",11,,False,ec1kfht,False,False,1545140704.0,2018-12-18 07:45:04
Does anyone else here feel really dumb...?,itanorchi,"I've dealt with this all throughout my time in undergrad. Here's what I'd suggest to break out of that cycle of feeling inferior. 

Stop comparing yourself to your peers. You are not your peers and they are not you. You each have had different lives, different upbringings, different circumstances that have led to where each of you are today. Even though it may seem logical to compare yourself with them because you go to the same school, it's really not logical. 

A student who came out of let's say Exeter is going to have the upper hand compared to some kid who came from a NYC public school. Maybe both study at Columbia, but the kid from Exeter has had significantly more and better academic training. That kid may not even be as well prepared as another Exeter grad who maybe took harder classes in high school because his middle school prepared him for it. Point I'm trying to make is that the path everyone has been on is quite distinct. It has led to where they are now, even though you're all at the same school. 

I realized this when I felt utterly stupid compared to other kids here. Eventually I realized if I wasn't dealing with a chronic illness everyday for 2 years of undergrad, my circumstances and grades would have been totally different. I accepted my circumstances. 

This does not mean that I gave up. Nor am I trying to say that you should just accept what is and give up improving your GPA. What I am saying is that you can't improve if you hold yourself to someone else's standard. 

How do you get out of your seemingly inescapable rut? You should first write down your habits. What do you typically do in a day? What are your study habits? Analyze what's possibly holding you back. Then improve on that. Try to be better than you were yesterday. Don't try to be better than your friend with a 3.8. Be better than yourself with a 3.27 first. The more you fixate on other people, the less you'll improve yourself. What you should do is possibly see how your peers study. Maybe their study habits can be useful to you. 

So basically- compare yourself to yourself yesterday. Are you better off today than you were yesterday? What helped you do that? Can you improve more? I'd suggest getting a journal or using your computer to write this down. Reflect. 

I did this in undergrad and raised my GPA a good amount. I stopped worrying about how the class average on midterms were 90+ or how my friends all had 3.8s. I stopped caring. I started caring about me. I started focusing on what I can do to myself so I can raise my GPA even by a little. Over time, it ended up being more than just a little. I ultimately did just as well as my peers in my final semesters, and even better in some cases.

Lastly, I think you should realize or eventually realize that academic performance has little to do with overall success in life. No, I won't tell you that because of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs being dropouts and succeeding. I'm telling you that because it's something I have seem time and time again- that real success career wise comes mostly from other factors. These factors include networking, learning stuff outside of class, personal projects (building your GIThub with tons of projects matters way more for CS than you'd think), constant determination, the willingness to take risks, courage, and confidence in the self. I know kids with 2.8s running their own companies with 3.8s working for them. That happens not because of GPA or anything like that. It's happened because the 2.8 focused on what mattered for a successful career. They networked, they proved their worth beyond a classroom. You don't need a 3.8 to do that. You just have to be better than you were yesterday, or a week before, or a year before. You'll get there as long as you keep your head up and never give in to that feeling of inferiority.",9,,False,ec1zfzg,False,False,1545153464.0,2018-12-18 11:17:44

This is sometimes called priming a lecture. In an ideal world, this means reading all of the assigned/relevant reading and trying to tell why we're learning this now, how it connects with previous information, and where we're going with it.

Where are some semi-secret but really good places to study on campus?,immortal_conclusions,"Oh man, as a former introverted Columbia student, you asked my favorite question.

The lawful-good answers: 

1. Law library in Jerome Greene. Usually not that full, and very very quiet. 
2. Empty classroom in Hamilton. Preferably one with window access to a balcony where you can take your smoke breaks (just kidding).
3. Milstein Library at Barnard. Not too much seating room, but for some reason it's never felt packed and it's a nice new space. Plus if it is full you can just cross over to Diana which has ample study space dispersed across it for some reason. 

The neutral-good answers: 

1. Basement of CV Starr East Asian Library in Kent Hall. You have to enter the stacks and take the elevator/stairs allllll the way down. There you will find a fully equipped and LARGE study space with cozy carrels, tables, multicolored couches etc, and super great climate control. There are hardly ever people there except grad students. Check out the artwork in some of the books down there if you have time, it's super rad. 
2. Geology library in Schermerhorn. Small, but super cozy and rarely full. 
3. Music library in Dodge. Another safe choice. Clean, quiet, bright. 
4. Burke library at Union Theological Seminary. Like Ref 2.0, except more...medeival. Not usually crowded, though. 

The chaotic-evil answers:

1. Lehman library in IAB (SIPA). The main area is always really crowded, but....find the hallway that leads to the big reading room behind the color printers, and then take the convenience stairs up to the balcony. Yes, it is hard to find, but you will be rewarded. It's always deserted! Plus you have a great birds eye view of the stressed out MPA and law students below you in said reading room. 
2. Chemistry library in Havemeyer, if you can go when it isn't crammed by dozens of stressed out premeds trying to get extra points during office hours. Pro tip: see if you can sneak into the closed off old part of the library. Literally the most spooky and private place on campus. Had many a good cry there. It's especially beautiful around sunset when the red afternoon sunlight makes all the dust motes dance. There are also lots of old and cool chemistry artifacts and books if you're into that sort of thing. 
3. Similarly, the lower level stacks of the math library are equally deserted and spooky. The only downside to it is it's harder to sneak down there, there is no seating, and it's really dusty. But you'll never find a soul down there. Worth exploring at least once. On a more reasonable note: The upper level of the stacks in the math library (the one you have to take the stairs up to) is usually not full and has some great views. 
4. ButStax 

And lastly, hidden gems in the dorms:

1. The sky/study lounges in Broadway Hall. Take the elevator up to the top floor, and you have two often empty rooms with skyline views. 
2. Sky lounges in Hartley and Wallach: mostly lackluster but good if you happen to live in the LLC or John Jay.",45,,False,f98d8mo,False,False,1575176884.0,2019-11-30 23:08:04

Feeling sad vibes due to low GPA and mild imposter syndrome,,"I think you need to do a lot of self introspection to see where your strengths lie and what you want to do with those strengths. For instance, you say you are taking 1004 and struggling with it because of lack of technology experience. I’d argue java or most intro to programming classes don’t really have as much to do with tech experience as first order logic/ reasoning. Moreover, you say you are a humanities student in CC but then you decided to take some fairly stem heavy classes (which is not necessarily a bad thing on its own but your strengths may or may not lie there). Why even take that if you are trying to go to law school?
What are you interested in? What are you good at? 
To be employed you need to convince an employer that you bring sufficient value on your area of expertise. If you take a hodgepodge of stem and humanities classes and end up being mediocre in a lot of them that’s a much worse case scenario than failing a bunch of stem classes and excelling in political classes or whatever

I definitely have been in your shoes before as far as impostor syndrome and even the GPA thing. I'm a senior now and what worked for me was finding what I loved and not giving a shit about what other people said re: what I study or how my grades are. My path was

Econ-Math ==> Econ-Psych ==> Econ-Stats ==> CS, econ minor

so I've definitely had to do a lot of soul searching, especially after bombing Calc 3 first semester freshman year. 

Numerically: 

* take a language class or two. 5 credits, usually easy A, helps GPA big time. 
* frontload your global cores while you're still figuring out what you wanna study
* a lot of majors will allow you to P/D/F the intro class, so do that with 1004 and see if you think it's major material at the end of the semester, as I did
* If not CS, no worries. maybe consider a major which is easier but still respected, like Psych or History
* Psych 1001 fulfills Science req in CC and is an interesting class, if you wanna consider that for Major
* Nail it in Music and Art hum. You can totally get GPA boosting A+'s in those classes; just show up, get your essays revised before you submit, search [ezacu.com](https://ezacu.com) for easy teachers

GPA's not everything, trust me. you're right in that if you show that you improve, people will take note. just keep your head up and keep grinding -- there's a reason you were chosen to come here and the only person you need to prove it to is yourself.",3,,False,f3tq5ar,False,False,1571143128.0,2019-10-15 07:38:48

Feeling sad vibes due to low GPA and mild imposter syndrome,tiltonbush,"Hey,

I just wanted to say that I completely get where you’re coming from. 

With that being said, I’m only a freshman in CC, so I hope the things I say don’t off as if I’m trying to one-up ur problems or dismiss the severity of them. I too feel pretty overwhelmed with college and my future in general because of factors like the intensity of some of my classes and me worrying about how I spend my time effectively.

Anyway from my limited amount of knowledge and experience, I’ve learned that there is nothing more important than the stuff that YOU choose to care about (which is usually stuff that you’re good at). I think that if u take a moment to redirect ur time and energy into the stuff that you’re willing work for (instead of stuff that u don’t care about) will help not only for results but I also ur mental to stay forward thinking and motivated.  I guess what I’m saying is similar to what the other comment said, but I too have also realised that the shit that isn’t meaningful to me I shouldn’t spend as much time stressing over - I should be purring that energy into stuff k actually care about. 

Even though it sounds kinda bullshitty to say, but I think it’s kind of liberating to realise that things only have value unless u give it value. I  can completely understand the importance of GPA but big picture wise, I’m sure that because 1) the class had nothing to do with ur major and 2) it happened the fall of ur freshman year, the severity of it isn’t as bad as you may think it is. You have much more than half of college left and 

I’m kind of a hypocrite in not following through with this myself, but taking the time to be chill about all of the overwhelming shit life and Columbia throws at u definitely helps with my mental and ability to focus and actually care  about only the things that are meaningful to me. I also remind myself that no matter what, it’s gonna to be okay.

I hope through all of that you could derive at least some tangible advice...It’s 3:20am and I should be asleep lol so apologies if some of what I said was incoherent.

Ask someone for their phone number or social media and tell them that you'd like to meet up for coffee sometimes in the week. And then, make sure that happens! Also, check out some clubs and student groups that you're interested in. You can meet more people when you attend events. The tough part is making sure that some of these conversations don't end then and there.

The secret is to join things: whether it's a traditional club, a publication, something in Greek life (despite the stereotypes there is a greek organization that fits every type of person), or just joining in on a group of people you sorta know when they go out. Also look into the pre-NSOP groups, I know many people who met close friends that way.

College is a great time to test out what kind of person you want to be. It's true, it can be hard at times, but if you come in with an open mind you'll have a good time.

You said you don't have many close friends. That's alright, you don't have to be friends with the whole school. Start of small and see how you feel, you'd be surprised how warm and receptive people here can be, especially when you reach out.

So here's something about Columbia (New York City in general). It's tough to make \*close\* friends, but once you do, you become besties facing the storm together.   


Honestly, the best way I've found is to go to a club from day one. Pick something you like and just go for it. Everyone is joining new clubs at the beginning of the school year, so you absolutely won't be alone.

I got into Columbia! Now how do I make friends...,llamalord40,"First of all, congrats on CU! 

I’m a sophomore now, and can totally understand what you’re feeling. I was pretty uncertain going in as well. Orientation week is like a huge melting pot of people who are in the same situation. Typically, people are almost always open to meeting other people. You’ll also have your OL group, etc. 

Depending on the dorm you get, your friend group can also be the people on your floor. I was on JJ9 last year, and our vibe was super tight. We always played smash in the lounge and would just chill in each other’s rooms for hours. Of course, this also depends on the type of vibe your floor has.

Towards the beginning of the semester, CU has a massive club day that advertises all the different student groups at the school. There’s a ton, so I reccomend signing up for a bunch of email lists! I know I made most of my friends through the CUMB (Columbia University Marching Band) and a bunch of other music stuff. Overall though, I wouldn’t worry.

I got into Columbia! Now how do I make friends...,ModerateContrarian,"Well, I'm gonna take a bit of a different take on this as a current, nearly friendless CC freshman who wasn't that social most of HS. Have a plan B for the time you would otherwise spend socializing in case it doesn't work out rather than letting it hurt you. NSOP is incredibly easy to miss out on and come out of it knowing barely anybody. I literally could call myself acquainted w/two or three people at the end of it. Student organizations can be hit-or-miss too, especially ones that meet weekday nights, when the only thing on your mind is the test the next day. Meeting people in classes is possible, but it's not at all optimal. But [very unpopular opinion] as long as you look at it as a hidden opportunity rather than a disaster, having few friends isn't that bad.  With the time I spent socializing in High school I've managed to read over 3000 pages of pleasure reading this semester. What's the worst that can happen if you don't have much of a social life? That'll just mean more time to dedicate to your classes, aka the reason you're coming here and [maybe] paying more money than the average person will earn in a year per semester, as much as some people seem to forget it.",3,,False,ec0s87e,False,False,1545102036.0,2018-12-17 21:00:36

The real dead giveaway is this comment-

 

First I want to thank you for stepping up and saying such nice things about SPS. I personally have never heard of such an acronym ""CYH"", but it is nice to know that it is a thing. We are significantly younger compared to the other two schools but as you said, our academic horsepower is unmatched. Though objectively I have to say Yale Law and Harvard Med are probably more famous than us currently, but we have every hope to surpass them in that regard as well in the near future.

I am sorry for your rejection. I know it must hurt. But what's important is to understand why you got rejected, and learn from it. At SPS, a considerable part the admission decisions, decisive even, is your softs. The admission process at SPS is not nearly as straightforward as for law school where scores always come first. These softs include your extracurricular activities, your work experience, your intangibles, and many other factors beyond your control. Having perfect GPAs and GREs alone won't make the cut. Rather, it's only a necessity. Maybe it was the fact that you turned down invitations to social gatherings that later became the kryptonite to your application, because leadership skills and the ability to interact with all walks of life are highly emphasized in SPS's admission decisions. Without those, chances are you are in for becoming part of the larger denominator of the admissions rate. So, even though it was not the best outcome you hoped for, you could still learn a lot from it. At the end of the day, it is not where you go to school that matters the most, it's where you can find the best match. Maybe SPS is just not a good match for you. Our students are not necessarily smarter or more accomplished than other schools. We also have tons of stress, pressure and hate (as you can obviously see from the posts here) to deal with. The fact that Yale Law took you means that they found you to be a good match, and that is where you can get the most out the school to unleash all your potential.

Purpose of A/B sub-terms if it's online?,normiep,"There's apparently some evidence that concentrating on only a smaller number of subjects at a time (even if at an intense level) is easier than concentrating on 4 or 5 subjects.   Since online courses supposedly make concentrating even harder, having fewer things to worry about at a time would be even more important.  

To be honest, my anecdotal experience with the summer classes (that are the same duration as the immersive courses) has not been consistent with this.   But that's just one instructor's feeling and isn't a rigorous study in any way, shape, or form.

In my own department the few Fall B courses we offered were specifically aimed towards incoming MS students who would likely not be able to arrive in NY until October.   Even if the courses themselves were partially online, physically being in the US had important implications for some international students (because of their home country's laws, ability to use CPT for internships, etc).

An interesting article written by a tenured professor at Columbia about our current situation,oopsadmiralakbar,"Didn’t read it myself BC I’m lazy but here is the full text of the article

“I’ve taught literature at Columbia University for 20 years. This past week, I’ve been in close touch with my students via email and Zoom as we all stumble together into the new realities of education during a pandemic. And it’s already clear that moving classes online won’t let us approximate the semester we thought we were going to have at the beginning of March.

We’re now scrambling to transition everyone to remote learning on short notice, addressing each obstacle that arises as a problem to be fixed. Yes, taken individually, each student who doesn’t have a laptop or WiFi access off campus, who didn’t bring their textbooks home when they left for spring break, or whose survival depends on a paycheck now lost can be helped. Online learning and conferencing tools may groan under heavy usage, but we can hope they won’t break. We can also hope faculty and staff won’t break under the huge additional workload entailed in moving courses online that weren’t designed to be taught that way: a translation that poses particular challenges for science labs and practical classes in everything from physical therapy and nursing skills to dance and music performance.
But the cumulative stress on the system is too great, and the inequities in the ways this will all play out for different students means that grading as we know it is already over for the semester. It’s time to abandon our preconceived ideas about what needs to happen in a college class for a student to get credit for it.

Instead, colleges and universities should adopt three central principles to ease stress on students, who are reeling like everybody else: Strip down work expectations to the bare minimum; introduce mandatory pass-fail at the very least (opt-in pass-fail would just put undue pressure on our most driven students, many of whom already suffer from chronic anxiety and depression) and consider giving enrolled students A grades as a default; and work to wrap classes up as quickly as possible in most cases, so students can turn their full attention to other pressing matters.

I wrote to both of my classes a week ago to say that I would give everyone an A based on the work they’d done already. Regardless of what my university’s leadership ultimately decides about distance learning, I intend to do exactly that. The reading and thinking they have done already has been significant, and as a tenured professor, I am in a position to make that decision on my own without fear of consequences for violating administration policy.

But many instructors don’t have the job security that would let them make this choice unilaterally. And what happens when teachers in any given department or institution start to fall ill and it’s not reasonable to imagine finding a substitute to take over for grading?

Education isn’t just about mastering material and improving skills. Education is about ethics. It’s about learning how to be a better member of a community, whatever that community is (a classroom or a college, but also a family, a workplace, a civic polity). It’s about understanding how to balance the drive toward intellectual development and mastery of new concepts and material with self-care and the sane management of responsibilities to the broader community.

Learning how to shift priorities in the face of new information and circumstances is an essential component of education. We are not prioritizing the right values when we focus so narrowly on academic matters while our students are experiencing a flood of other practical and emotional demands on finite resources.

Even before the first cases of covid-19 were diagnosed in the United States, many undergraduates were already reporting that they experienced food and housing insecurity. Not every student has a bed to go home to, let alone a good Internet connection and the privacy and quiet conducive to deep focus. A cascade of harsher effects are about to follow as the pandemic rolls through the nation: from wage and job loss for students and their family members to significant fallout as the health-care system moves to prioritize the surge in coronavirus cases over care for patients with other serious illnesses.

At the same time, students and faculty with children are experiencing massive new demands in terms of child care now that schools and day cares are shut down. Other care responsibilities, especially for elderly and disabled loved ones, are likely to expand dramatically as well. And the policy of social distancing puts enormous extra pressure on everyone.

Naysayers raise objections that it’s unfair not to give our students full recognition of their excellence. They note, correctly, that grades are needed for scholarships, fellowships, graduate school admissions. They worry, also correctly, that the consequences of such a move for millions of students with educational loans and visas that require letter grades to remain in good standing would be devastating.
But none of this is set in stone.

We are so used to spending our time assessing and evaluating that we risk forgetting that those results are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. We’re the ones who make the policies, and we can change them to meet the needs of changing times.

Federal and state regulation of the conditions that trigger revocation of a student visa or the retraction of loan commitments can be changed. We should be talking to state regulators about temporarily waiving program and degree requirements that might limit the flexibility of colleges to grant degrees to students expecting to finish this semester. We should be looking ahead to the fall semester and thinking about how classes may need to be retooled in the light of work that’s compromised this semester, especially for languages, the natural sciences and the quantitative social sciences that build very directly on the previous semester’s work. We should be working not just nationally but internationally to develop a consensus around best practices for how the academic work students have done this semester can be best noted and appreciated as they apply for jobs and graduate programs and so forth down the road.

We can support students and colleagues along the way. And we must also support faculty not on the tenure track, college teachers who despite their excellent skills and credentials are wildly undercompensated for the work they do, and who in many cases don’t know from one semester to the next not just what they will teach but whether they will be hired to teach at all.

With the best of intentions, and under intense time pressure, administrators have pushed faculty to think only one step ahead rather than encouraging us to look at the bigger picture. It’s an elaborate form of denialism, a way of soothing ourselves with frantic activity when it would be smarter to quiet our minds and call on flexible imaginations and nerves of steel.

What students and teachers alike need is for university leaders to help us all to do the right thing: to modify the semester’s coursework and system of evaluation so that it can better accommodate the sharply intensified financial, health and emotional demands of life in spring semester 2020.”",25,,False,fl3gtpf,False,False,1584783290.0,2020-03-21 04:34:50
An interesting article written by a tenured professor at Columbia about our current situation,damnatio_memoriae,"giving everyone an A seems incredibly foolish. making the semester pass/fail for everyone is fair, but it shouldn’t be a guaranteed pass either.  otherwise you might as well just cancel all classes because that’s totally meaningless.   a year from now people will expect a passing grade from a course taught today to mean something — namely that the student demonstrated knowledge and understanding of the material.  surely it’s obvious that there will be some students for whom that won’t be true when this is all over, for whatever reason.  let them take the those courses again for free if necessary, but don’t just blindly pass them or worse give them an A just because.  that makes no sense.",4,,False,fl4lvy1,False,False,1584816351.0,2020-03-21 13:45:51

I set my expectations low but this is still really disappointing — would it have really been that difficult to survey effectively which artist students want, like any other colleges with similar spring concerts do?

What is grad school (PhD) life like at Columbia?,loner_ism,"1. definitely doable, depends on your housing choices. there's also opportunities to TA to make extra $$
2. depends on the program. in mine, members of my cohort have become my best friends. we're specialists at this point so being competitive doesn't make sense
3. I met other PhD students through taking classes with them. otherwise, it's been hard to meet other PhDs outside of my department  
4. Columbia is garbage at communicating, and you have to do a lot of digging to figure everything out. but there are a lot of amazing opportunities available for PhD students especially relative to other programs 
5. people have different experiences with the city, it's definitely a lot. I personally love it here and can't imagine having to leave in a few years. pre-covid I would go out at least once a weekend, now I mostly spend time at the park and the beach 
6. some people go into a PhD like a sprint but it's a marathon! figure out your routine and what makes you happy, take days off to enjoy being a person in the world, and study things that interest you.

What is grad school (PhD) life like at Columbia?,beautifulcosmos,"1.) It's hard, but possible. Definitely live with roommates,  write up a budget, factor in how much you want to spend for leisure and consider applying for fellowships for supplemental income. I'm a bit a older (early 30s) still thinking about doing a PhD, but I'm also at a point where I need to build a cushion. If you are young, it shouldn't be a problem

2.) Depends on the program. I did my MA in ethnic studies/humanities and I found my cohort to be friendly.

3.) Yes. I found that my department did a lot of social events that involved different departments in our school. Made some cool friends in SOA, Germanic studies, Slavic studies and East Asian studies.

4.) My only regret is that I wish I talked with people in the Dean's office, my advisors more and made an effort to attend department sponsored events. I really was some sort of weird hermit creature that just showed up to class and slide into my professor's inbox periodically while doing my Masters.

What is grad school (PhD) life like at Columbia?,fatchad420,"ABD Ph.D. student chiming in:

1) You will be fine with roommates, the graduate student housing isn't bad. I worked (and continue to work) full-time in industry throughout my Ph.D. program.

2) This really depends on your lab, but for the most part the community is really close-knit, collaborative, and non-competitive.

3) I'm not sure about your program, but half of my course work consisted of inter-disciplinary courses (statistics for example) and was a mix of graduate students (masters and PhD).

4) There really isn't any good structure around communicating the overall Ph.D. process. The departments are all different, and the ODS is really poor at answering any questions so you really need to be motivated and driven to get through the bureaucracy (especially at later stages of the program). The other thing worth noting is that your experience as a phd student is largely driven by your advisor, so making sure you have a good report with them throughout the process is key to succeeding. 

5) I no longer live in NYC, but I enjoyed the experience. I used to go out almost every night.

What is grad school (PhD) life like at Columbia?,YAYGASM,"1.  My stipend is a bit less and I get by while still managing to save a little + spend a bit on non-essentials.  I'm in graduate student housing with one other roommate.
2.  I cant speak for other programs, but in mine (EE) there's no real reason to compete.  I do believe that the cutoff for passing your quals is determined in some part by the scores of everybody else you took it with that year, but I've never experienced any competitiveness related to that.  
3.  I think I've seen one (maybe two?) interdisciplinary mixer type events held by the school in the time that I've been here.  Day to day activities for me are generally limited to people in my department.  If you want interaction beyond the Columbia sponsered events you'll probably have to seek them out yourself. 
4.  Columbia is pretty nice.  As always with these schools dealing with the administration is kind of a pain in the ass, but nothing too bad.  Communication is sub-par so expect to do some digging. 
5.  I've lived in the area my entire life and never really appreciated it until I moved away during my undergrad.  I try to go out and do stuff every weekend and I'm successful probably 75% of the time (pre-pandemic).  The other maybe 15% of the time I'm busy with work and the last 10% just me feeling lazy.  
6.  Try to take it easy.  Undergrad you can work at 100% because eventually the work ends, but for the PhD there's always something more that can be done.  Maybe there are people out there that can go at 100% indefinitely, but I'm not one of them.

So maybe see if you can try out the same. 5 is standard at Columbia but most of my friends in other schools only take 4 classes a semester. It makes a world of a difference. 

Always do your research and take the easiest professor possible. There is literally no benefit in taking the harder professor even if they may be a better teacher. Grades matter for getting into grad school, not the difficulty of your professors in undergrad. 

Also, many grad seas students who came from seas undergrad that I know had B grades in general, including myself. Not sure if it applies to other schools and depts in Columbia. Columbia knows how hard it can be for it's own students. 

Edit: let me just add this. Something I had to accept by my junior year in undergrad was that in reality, school wasn't for ""taking all the challenging classes and learning tons to feel fulfilled."" Sorry to break it to you, but in order to thrive and come out on top, you need to have the highest GPA you can get. That will probably mean taking easier classes, easier professors, easier everything, even if you don't feel fulfilled. So how do you get those skills you've always wanted?

How well do most people actually do to Columbia?,,"Columbia administration published some data a while back, the average gpa for a college math major was around a 3.3-3.4, probably higher for the econ major because its easier. There are a few things to keep in mind though for grad school admissions. SEAS as a whole had a lower gpa average than the college probably because the core is pretty inflated.

1. Relevant class GPA matters more than overall gpa. That is if you are trying to do research in global economic policy, your econ classes play much more of a role than your music/art/lithum classes.
2. Class difficulty matters. You need to take high level classes to get into competitive grad schools, probably 4000 level classes by junior year.
3. You probably get a slight boost for being at Columbia, with that said you probably need at least a 3.7 major specific gpa to be an uber competitive applicant unless you have other major draws like first author/multiple publications
4. You can compensate a poor gpa very heavily by getting very into research/getting good recs/getting out papers from a lab at columbia

Basic Questions for Everyone (especially Pre-Meds),invrede,">is it best to have classes back-to-back or more spread out?

Depends on you. I've friends who hate it and friends who love it. Personally I like having classes back to back two days a week. 

>how do you guys like taking notes?

iPad Pro. Even the entry level iPad + Pencil will suffice and is 1000x better than paper. 

>what classes would you recommend for taking first and second semester?

Aside from core classes, you should take Gen Chem I+II, Gen Chem Lab, and Calculus I or Stats. 

If you want to do Neuroscience, Intro to Psych. 

>for gen chem and calc I , what prof do you recommend?

I can't remember which ones are bad or okay. None are great. 

>do you think it would be feasible to do a pre-med track WHILE pursuing both a neuroscience major and another concentration (i'm looking into human rights)?

No. That said major doesn't matter for medical school, so focus on doing your pre-reqs, taking classes you enjoy, and doing well in them!

>and is it possible to start foreign language 2nd semester of freshman year, as opposed to immediately 1st semester as recommended?

Depends on whether or not they offer the sequence at that time. Check with the language you want to take. 

>how do you go about finding research opportunities on campus, and when (in terms of semesters) do you recommend for aspiring pre-meds to start research?

This year will be weird because of COVID19. But I cold emailed professors, most in usual circumstances are enthusiastic about taking undergrads with little experience. 

>how many clubs do students find themselves taking at once? i have my eye on 3 to 4 that i find interesting, alongside work study, but does this seem like i'm taking on too much at once? i'd still want some free time to myself haha

That is too much. School at Columbia takes a lot of time, and GPA is very important for medical school. I'd say it's feasible to be heavily involved in two clubs alongside working. But that doesn't mean you can't swing around to random meetings of clubs you aren't super involved in. Don't take on too much too early. Start with school work, then add a job, and then increase involvement in ECs. Keep in mind that for premed students things like clinical volunteering, shadowing and/or research are also things you need to be doing.

Basic Questions for Everyone (especially Pre-Meds),Tom-Bombadil-1934,"Hey there. I'm a soph in neuro, premed, and concentrating. 1.) I think the spread of your classes up to when you best function and their availabilities. If you're doing neuro, premed, and concentration, be prepared for dense schedules, maybe a class on Fridays too (most people don't have classes on Fridays). 

2.) For classes freshman year, take gen chem plus lab, and then either calc, stats, or intro psych. For gen chem I had Savizky 1st sem, and Beer 2nd sem, and both were fine. Parkins teaches in the mornings, and he is generally considered to be more ""fun"", but tbh, there's not much difference in their grading. They have different teaching styles tho. I didn't take Calc I so not sure about that.

3.) It's feasible, and if you enjoy neuro and the concentration, go for it. A lot can change, and honestly, you have a lot of time, I won't even start my concentration until prob spring, and it's fine. Just map out the semesters, what your schedules roughly might look like to see if everything fits.

4.) For research opps, you can email a bunch of labs and see if they're looking for an assistant. That's what I did. One of them, which is my current lab, didnt respond for 2 months, and then randomly emailed me back when they needed one, so it never hurts. There are some work study jobs where you can be a research assistant, but I heard those range in quality so you'll have to ask around. You don't have to get started immediately. I know premeds who didn't start doing research until junior year.

5.) Clubs depend on how involved you want to be, and every club is different. Also, things are prob going to be hybrid, so not sure what clubs are gonna look like.

Find balance in your schedule. Given you’re wanting Gen Chem + Calc in the same semester,  maybe don’t take your Lit requirement + UW requirement at the same time. Try UW + one of the Hum classes. 

I take notes on a tablet using GoodNotes. I also have most of my readings on there (also in GoodNotes in a separate folder so I can reference them). 

As for timing of classes, it depends. If you’re taking classes that are an hour long each, you could probably max out mentally at 3 back to back without much of a break. Basically - don’t go more than 3 hours without a significant break because your brain will hate you. 

Start the language whenever you want, but once you pop - don’t stop! Same can be said for Chem/Math courses. Keep your sequences going. Trust me - you don’t want a break between Gen and O Chem. 

Clubs in the time of COVID are going to be very different. Maybe attend a few meetings for each and get a feel for the time commitment before committing. Be honest with the club that you’re doing that - they’ll understand! Which leads me to my next point - 

Make sure you have 3-5hrs/credit hour a week for studying for each class. If Chem is 4 credits, then you’ll need 12-20 hours a week to study for it. This is not an exaggeration for that class, either. You will want to look at your schedule and make sure you have the amount of time needed to study for your courses before committing to clubs/extras. 

Undergrad research: there is a whole web page on CU devoted to this topic. I think I found it under the bio dept once? Just google undergrad research + Columbia. They go over the many ways to try to get involved. Do not expect anything before you’re at least at the end of your sophomore year. 

My ultimate advice, which was once shared with me: let yourself coast a bit your first semester and adjust to Columbia. It’s okay to not dive in. Especially with your long term aspirations - you will likely benefit from pumping the breaks out the gate. 

I’m a neuro major navigating a lot of what you’re planning to do - feel free to reach out.",4,,False,fz0uy4k,False,False,1595539746.0,2020-07-23 16:29:06
Basic Questions for Everyone (especially Pre-Meds),,"Not a premed, but a lot of my friends were.

I usually like to block out my classes so I'm not constantly going from place to place, but its up to you. I take notes on blank sheets of paper; I never really look back at my notes, I just take them to help me follow along and internalize the info. Some people use iPads and stuff but I would highly discourage that, as I believe it reduces retention and distracts yourself (you are free to read some studies on this and decide yourself)

I like to take most of the major courses and courses required for research right away. Other people like doing geneds and stuff, which I think is very stupid, because you want to be able to apply for research, internships, etc. with a strong coursework body. First semester I took orgo, physics, multivariable calc, and then two core courses. If you aren't advanced in orgo, etc. just take the appropriate levels of chem, physics, or whatever you want.

Yes you can do that. One of my friends did a double major similar to what you want to do, however, he was a workhorse and was continually grinding. How much effort you want to put to do that is up to you.

Finding research generally comes down to making yourself seem valuable in terms of the skillset you provide as well as contacting profs via email. You will have better luck if you have skillsets required by the lab, or have prior experience. Keep in mind there are a lot of places peripheral to columbia that premeds do research; e.g. some of my friends did research at places like msk, the med campus, and the science building on 125.

The norm for clubs is like 1 or maybe 2. The premeds I knew did stack some clubs though and tended to have a bunch of random positions in various clubs. Was this necessary? IDK but thats what they did. Most of the hardcore premeds had no free time.

My favorite spot was probably the havemeyer computer lab, or the lerner one",3,,False,fz0s37d,False,False,1595538312.0,2020-07-23 16:05:12
Basic Questions for Everyone (especially Pre-Meds),Gabbysahy,"Hey there! Rising senior, premed and neuroscience major here. I go to Barnard so things might be slightly different depending on the school you're entering, but I'm sure some things are universal. I liked to have my classes back to back so that I could have larger blocks of time to focus on studying. That will depend more on how you work best, if you focus better in short bursts, it might be better to space out your classes. If you work better in longer consecutive periods of time, having your classes back to back might be better. Notes depended on the class for me, if the prof posts slides before class, I liked to print them out and write notes on them. If there weren't too many slides and more math problems or notes were written out for you, I just liked to handwrite my notes. I started foreign language freshman year just to get it out of the way. Math professors typically don't stick around (at least in my experience) so the prof I had will likely not be teaching Calc I, this is a pain because then you can't really find reviews on them :|. I pursued premed while doing my neuroscience major pretty easily! I decided sophomore year to do a CS minor and I'm on track to finish pretty much everything so I think it is definitely doable if you know early on what you want to do. (requirements for neuro major may be different at columbia compared to barnard, not sure) For research, I started summer of my freshman year, though I know a lot of people who did it later on! If you're interested in working in a columbia lab I recommend cold emailing a TON of people (that's what I did and I got a couple offers and a ton of ppl ignored me ). It is even more effective if you are interested in working in the lab of a professor you've taken a class with. You can go up to them after class and inquire or email, mentioning you're in their class.",3,,False,fz0tgaq,False,False,1595538996.0,2020-07-23 16:16:36

"Current freshman, don’t really have any friends",distortedtheory,I would recommend clubs like the Philolexian Society or CUMB or your favorite cultural group where first-years are treated with importance and you actually get to talk to people.

I had to take a medical leave for my second year and when I came back I knew I needed to make more friends for my senior year so I joined more clubs.,15,,False,f9yonbx,False,False,1575731607.0,2019-12-07 09:13:27
"Current freshman, don’t really have any friends",ImNotHereToMakeBFFs,">From what I’ve been seeing, this is definitely not the case for other students. They all seem to have lots of friends and enjoy going out together and having fun.

This is so painfully familiar. I recently wrote some advice to an incoming student and will say the same thing here: You are NOT alone. Trust me. It takes time to build relationships, especially the kind of relationship where you can 100% trust and confide and depend on someone. 

Freshman year is rough for most, even those that ""seem' like they have everything together. Those who seem like they found their clique, have a solid social circle, and are having so much fun, also frequently feel like outsiders and imposters. Everyone is eager to get along and fit in. For the vast majority, this is first time you are far from home, far from family, and far from your high school friends you've known for 4+ years. It takes time to rebuild a solid sense of belonging, trust, and community.

But it's possible. And very worth it in the end. 

I recommend avoiding larger clubs/organizations where you can get lost in the shuffle. Look for smaller dedicated groups with specific interests or identities. Consistently meet the same 5-6 people. Also consider joining a club that meets more than once a week, like a dance group or a pre-professional group, where they frequently meet to work on some kind project or performance. Working together on a team is a great way to build camaraderie.  

Finally, I would say, don't be afraid to be REAL. So many people at Columbia, especially freshman year, are eager to show that they *belong* at Columbia, that they are intelligent and capable. The result? A lot of people fake how well they are really doing on the surface. Be REAL about your struggles, about your feelings, about who you are, and what you want. It's scary. And a very vulnerable position to put yourself in. But those who are life-long friends will open up to you in return and stick around, and those who are just acquaintances will fade away.",12,,False,fa0awhr,False,False,1575751856.0,2019-12-07 14:50:56

"Current freshman, don’t really have any friends",PoofTheSwagginDragon,"Other people have mentioned it, but try to get involved with a few clubs that are open to everyone next semester and see if you like them. If you like writing, you can try The Federalist. If you are interested in space, definitely check out Columbia space initiative. I don’t know anyone in CUMB, but it looks like everyone in there enjoys it. 

As far as housing goes, wien is pretty much all singles and is open to sophomores. I know a ton of transfers live their when they first come to Columbia, so I assume you’d be able to get a single in there if you want. 

Also, I don’t know if you’re interested in Greek life at all, but that can be a good group for some people to join. People also make a ton of friends really quickly when they join. Greek life is definitely not for everyone though, so go to a few rush events next semester and see if you like it.

* Hamilton Deli (solid NYC-style bacon egg & cheese on bagel; the subs are satisfying, but IMO are best appreciated when you're living on campus, swamped with work, and just need fast calories)
* Doaba Deli (inexpensive and awesome veg Indian food -- get a mango lassi + a plate of tasty things)
* Freda's (Caribbean soul food, so delicious)
* Pisticci or Max Soha (solid Italian)
* Levain Bakery (u right, it's amazing)
* Hungarian Pastry Shop (not sure what the deal is with covid; I think 80% of the charm is the cramped seating, so unless you can get a seat outside, I'd probably save this for post-covid times)
* Amsterdam Ave around campus is a really nice walk. The fountain/garden right next to St. John the Divine is a great place to stop and relax.

One day Columbia Campus Trip,Raymond_Damadian,"Oh, wait you're the ROK Mil huh? Nvm, I retract my previous statement.

&#x200B;

This is more addressing your **last post about what you should do with your time in ROK.**

For better or worse, it seems we're moving as a culture that values efficiency per experience/time played. Both virtually and Physically. Throughout my seemingly long life, I've realized a few things: Life shouldn't be played efficiently, and if it is, what is the point, achieving accolades and success by a certain age? if so, why? 

Use this time to ask yourself questions about what I mentioned previously. find out why you make decisions, what motivates them, what your values are, why you are doing what you are doing. Who knows you may not even like CS or are doing it because you were socialized at a young age to take care of your family. Doesn't need to be so. 

My advice: Let itself play out accordingly while enjoying the many moments from A to B. You will add more value to yourself, classmates, and the society you'll be apart of if you start asking yourself these questions. 

Now you can easily dismiss this as a western point of view, your prerogative. 

If you want to continue on the path of CS fuck yeah man, totally, do it. but that doesn't have to be an overwhelming part of your 2 years. My advice on that would be to find your dream job posting and see what they ask for.  

 Now that being addressed, spending a few hours on learning CS/Quant stuff would sure to be beneficial if that's what you want. If you want to teach yourself ML here is something I've used in the past, to great effect.

Dean Harford: Why he was fired as dean of students,emprss_theodora,"Have you bothered to read the actual court filling or just the reporting that got a lot of the context wrong? She didn't have housing, she wasn't even enrolled in classes. She was brand new and starting this semester.  I want to believe this girl, supposedly there are texts and that are highly damning, supposedly Dean Rodgers knew about the texting. But the timeline is weird and her knowledge of certain school resources and not others genuinely raises questions for me as someone who was closely involved with admin and their inner workings and processes for 5 years as a student.

She wasn't a student, she was supposed to start this semester. She was couch hopping (not out of the ordinary), not living in campus housing like a lot of the articles made it seem and was raped by someone she was staying with off campus. She went to the cops, the lawsuit leaves out the results of that kit.  And before having orientation or any of the info sessions she somehow knew to reach out to SVR. Ok... Sure possibly maybe she already had friends on campus that told her (one come assume that her advising dean may have told her and I believe it was even reported that hers was questioning her interactions... Which is strange considering you don't find out your assigned Dean until orientation which for her should be this week), but in my experience unless you're enrolled in classes documentably, getting help from CPS or getting an ID for building access, or damn near anything administrative is a near nonstarter. Just being accepted doesn't give you an all access pass to campus and services.

And supposedly SVR being the darlings they are when they found out about her homelessness... Direct her to Harford first? Not Vice Dean Rodgers, the GS housing liaison, not housing itself to try and find out if getting a room assignment early ahead of enrollment was possible...and this is all 6 days before commencement, 4 days before class day, in the middle of Harford record checking and signing off on every GS graduate, working on last minute incompletes requests and dealing with his own serious family situation.  That's when Harford supposedly went off the damn rails so hard for a new student he barely knew that, he told her he'd give up his position in GS for her? (That's in the lawsuit) 

Then, while knowing enough about school resources to seek help from SVR, she doesn't know enough to know or ask around that Harford actually has very little to do with FA and instead of walking across the hall to see Skip or Daniel, willingly begins to engage in a sexual relationship on the hopes of getting extra money out of it? I don't buy for a minute that she believed her funding was ever on the line. The first year GS aid packages are notoriously horrible, and its made very clear from your welcome packet who you're supposed to talk to about appeals and owed balance waivers.

It's equally possible to me that:
 a) a accepted student who was savvy enough to be able to find multiple free crash spots in the city would try and game for more money in a shit FA system.  
b) that a there WAS a power imbalance to the situation and she was unresourceful enough to do the diligence of a 5 min Google search and realize he was not who she was supposed to talk to
I don't comprehend at all how she could have thought that he was the be all end all magical gatekeeper to more institutional money.  

But hey, maybe she did and it's entirely possible that Harford is the best fucking actor ever and after around a decade of service to the school and many opportunities to engage in the same behavior with other students finally said fuck it today imma fuck my life up, fuck this school up, fuck everyone?

Dean Harford: Why he was fired as dean of students,frothyloins,"No, I don't think it was. It will be easy to prove if she was sent to see a therapist at CPS and whether or not Dean Harford directed it. When this case plays out there will be no doubt as to whether or not that happened. It doesn't matter if she should've been sent to someone else, or whether she should've been allowed to see a therapist despite not being a student yet if *that is what happened*, which can be easily proven. If there are also text messages and call records between the dean and a prospective student, that would show that he was at *least* in a consensual sexual relationship that was improper for a person in his position.

In the end, I think it's wise for everyone to reserve judgement until this plays out.

How to make friends?,kzbt,"I felt the exact same way my freshman year, with a tight hometown group far away and what I felt were only friendly acquaintances in college. Ultra depressing. For me, making the solid community of friends I have now was about treating them like my friends at home, being super open and goofy which prompted many of them to the same. If they didn’t want to come out but were good staying in, we’d end up in someone’s room or a lounge and end up having just as much if not more fun as going out. 

It’s not just you! Freshmen at all colleges away from home go through this. Feeling like you’re afloat on your own is tough, but coming to view someone as a close and reliable friend takes time. I think best you can do is treat them as one and remember the occasional loneliness is ok too, in which case do something for yourself or someone else, like watch a show or bring a friend a random gift (or both).

It gets much better, like exponentially :) good luck!",14,,False,dt0gvag,False,False,1516547780.0,2018-01-21 09:16:20

How to make friends?,,"To be honest this is something I think about a lot too, and I think everybody thinks about it at some point. Anybody who says they're never lonely is a ~liar~~~~. However, loneliness is compounded by comparison, don't compare yourself to other people. People tend to project their best moments and conceal their worst. It's very likely that the same people you see who seem to be saturated in companionship you don't notice or see when they're alone. The other thing is that you might be cutting others off unintentionally by being too focused on finding ""your people"". People who seem cool on the outside may not be cool on the inside, as cliche as that may seem. A lot of the people I met here with great wit, charm, and character, the type of people I can count on are really low key. To be fair I'm also friends with a good handful of people who like to do all three, who like to get done up, but that was not what made me stay with them.

What are the hardest and easiest CS Tracks at Columbia?,puddle_or_pothole,"A lot of people are implying that OS is unreasonably difficult, but I’d argue that isn’t the case. It’s a lot of work, yes, but the concepts themselves are fairly straightforward for the most part. Where I think people likely fall down is on the programming assignments, which are quite a bit more involved than you’d see in most other courses. Another key difference is that you’ll be dealing with the Linux kernel code base, which is massive and in many places lacks detailed documentation.

Despite this, I would strongly recommend taking OS, even if you aren’t interested in systems programming. You’ll gain an invaluable understanding of how user space programs interact with the OS and by extension the hardware. A major secondary benefit is the experience you’ll build reading and understanding don’t large code bases that you didn’t write. If you’re going to work in industry this is a skill you’ll definitely need to develop at some point.

That said, I recognize that OS probably isn’t for everyone. If you had a hard time with C in AP you’ll definitely need to put in extra work to become fluent in it. Still, I’d recommend that people don’t dismiss OS at first look based on what they’ve heard.

Double majoring,,"It's feasible. But the biggest obstacle isn't the Core, but the 18 credit cap per semester. Most common dual majors are likely econ-philosophy and the like.

Double majoring,cyberswim,"To echo what others have said, double-majoring is no cakewalk, but it's absolutely doable. Advance planning, diligence, and commitment are key. ~~And some masochistic tendencies may be required.~~ Most would encourage you to consider carefully (1) why a double major is important to you, (2) how you're going to achieve it logistically, and (3) what you're willing to sacrifice in order to make it happen.

There are also certain conditions that might influence your likelihood of success:

* Which specific majors are you interested in, and how closely are they related? It would conceivably be easier to obtain a double major in linguistics and, say, Spanish language than it would be to double-major in disparate fields such as linguistics and physical chemistry. Some majors (biophysics, neuroscience, etc.) are already ""hybrid majors"" with more requisite classes and higher credit requirements at baseline.
* Were you able to get AP credit to count toward a major? Or do you stand a chance of testing out of certain requirements? For example, my double major would not have been feasible (at least not without a lot of severe self-inflicted pain) without placing out of Calculus I as well as the language requirement of the Core.
* Are you okay with spending lots of late nights in Butler (or at home/in the dorm) studying or drafting midterm papers rather than making frequent midnight trips to Williamsburg, sampling new exhibits at the Met, or hitting up Koronet after a drunken escapade? This is a deeply personal decision, and it probably bears considering what you'd like to get out of your college experience.

I am a senior financial Econ Major happy to answer any questions. Also please do my 5min survey for my economic seminar !,PlsDoSurvey,"If targeted finance and real world application is your goal above all, then Wharton or Stern may be a better choice. I think ultimately there are so many differences between schools that picking for that reason alone isn't the best idea but it is something to consider. Also, as someone going into banking this summer, I can tell you that everyone (all schools) does the majority of their learning on the job and Columbia is an unbelievable place for finance students to gain connections into finance (all banks/companies one trip on the 1 train away). 

As far as majors go, Fin Econ is the most practical with core classes like corporate finance (financial modeling), financial accounting (portfolio theory and management), and Financial accounting (normal accounting). The major begins, like all econ majors with normal mostly theory classes like micro and macro. Also math intense classes like calc 1 & 3, statistics, and econometrics (mix of stats and econ but really mostly stats). Once you pass the core econ in year 2 or so, you can take electives which vary in how theoretical you want. Honestly the most concrete and practical will be your fin. econ core (accounting, corp finance, and fin econ). 

In my opinion, choose the school you like the most apart from just the major. Comparing Wharton to Columbia or the other ivies has a ton of variables beyond the major and you do not pay the extra money to go to a school like that for concrete skills that everyone can learn in the first years as an analyst or in a free udemy course online.",8,,False,fow8276,True,False,1588114738.0,2020-04-28 17:58:58

Public econ was cool, little bit challenging. Much of it was reading economic papers to understand efficiencies of things like unemployment benefit in the public domain, or what are the real effects of forcing people to pay for Obamacare for example. 

International trade was ok, not hard. Learning models of trade, most of them do not hold up with actual data or are too simplistic to fully apply. They do make you think of trade differently bc over arching principles do apply. 

Market Design I cannot give a real statement on, given I am in the class now. The class covers auctions and matching. Both are cool topics to me.

The community’s energy towards internships and making the transition into the job market, at least to me, was a healthy and needed competition to ‘make it happen’. 

I can’t stress the important of perfecting your networking skills - it’s incredibly important to know how to meet people and have them remember you. It will also save you so. much. time. Blind applications go through sorting by algorithms and it’s easy to get sorted out by not using the right words in your resume. If you do go that route, literally pull up the internship description and replace as much of your resume with the SAME words use - that’s what’s being scanned. And you need to do it every time, it can be cumbersome but it’s what you gotta do. Synonyms don’t count in online applications.

Go to everything you can - clubs, events, seminars for the jobs and field you’re interested in. Even lectures from the business school, Econ department, and law schools are a good way to get insight into the market, and, meet people. Even if you don’t connect with a recruiter or get anxious and say something cringe-worthy, over time you’ll meet other motivated people who could luckily become your friends and you’ll normalize the process. It takes time and practice, but you’ll get the hang of it over time.

So on registry you sign up for the a general seminar course, this course has no time and no limit as it is just a place holder. You then are given a 'quiz' on courseworks for this course which asks you to rank the seminars with what you want most #1. The seminars you rank are from a list that you are given which gives descriptions and class times of each. The seminars are split on category into two groups, micro and macro with only some of them counting toward a fin econ major (they specify). The topics I have heard are international trade, Economics of Trust (literally like I 'trust you' type trust), Economics of Trusts (actual like anti competitive trusts), Financial Crisis of 2008, Economics of Art, and cryptocurrencies. 

Most of them follow a similar structure. You meet once a week, for the first half of classed they will be lecture/discussion. The next half will be students presenting papers on the topic and then you will be working on your own term paper (10-20p) that is due at the end of the class. Many are historical, hypothetical studies, actual studies like mine, or econometric with big data sets. 

I am not sure exactly on the job prospect. Above all GPA is king I would say. Is a 3.6 better from a fin econ than a 3.6 from a lit major- probably. But is a 3.9 lit major better than a 3.2 econ - yes. As long as you have a 3.5 or higher in econ I think that is a competitive GPA. All interviews for finance will require some prep on normal questions that a fin econ major may have a slight edge on, but bc of this they will also be expected to know more. All this info is very learnable for an interview. Apart from this, network is massive. Build a network and try to leverage/learn from connections to help with a job search.

I'd love to read an interview with a DA or prosecutor on the difficulty of trying a rape case. I imagine most of them come down to one person's word against the other's if there isn't any other compelling evidence.


And if someone can't be found guilty in court, can an institution like Columbia, or society at large, treat the accused as if they were guilty? Is that justice? If not, where do the victims find justice? Surely not in their own personal hell.

""One of my main goals was to have his name somewhere so if he committed another crime in New York City it would show up on his record so **the next person he might assault would have a better time than I did in prosecuting him**,” Sulkowicz told Daily Intelligencer. ""I felt like I had a civil and public duty to report as well."""" (emphasis mine)


The article also said that three separate students claimed to have filed complaints. That's an awful lot of sexual assault complaints for a non-rapist.

It is easy to meet people in your 1L section and through the many student organizations. Also, in terms of placement, you’d have to actively try not to come out with a job in big law.

Columbia Law Students: would you recommend attending? NYU?,LouisLittEsquire,"Current 3L. Like pretty much everyone that goes to CLS, I had the choice between the two. I have loved my time here, and it got me exactly where I want in terms of my career. I have found the majority of the professors to be good at their jobs. There are of course exceptions.   
   
Biggest downsides in my mind are the crap administration. It is really pretty awful, the different offices are bloated and yet seemingly understaffed at the same time? It seems like you can never get a clear answer to anything. Also, the facilities suck. The building is ugly and the size of the school means fighting for study space. Just try walking through JG at noon on a weekday, it is a madhouse.   
   
Biggest positives: if you want to do big law, there is no school better equipped to get you to the top firms besides perhaps Harvard. The V10s doors are wide open, and even the prestigious boutique firms get a lot of CLS students joining. I enjoyed my classmates, have a strong group of friends from here. I think it gets a bit “cliquey” because of how CLS puts students into their legal methods classes with their sections. For the first few weeks it is only 1Ls on campus and everyone is in a single class with their section. It makes people gravitate to the people they know. I didn’t see it as a downside thought, I really enjoyed it. Finally, I actually liked the location a lot. It is a lot easier to get good housing at CLS than NYU (unless you are willing to pay a boatload). It is also nice to not be smack dab in the heart of the city all the time. NYU is in a super busy area, when you are on Columbia’s campus you feel like you can escape from the noise sometimes.

This school is difficult and whoever says otherwise is lying. As a mathematics major, I sympathize heavy with you. I’m also a rising senior and this semester I took less credits to accommodate analysis but I still got completely destroyed by the class and may have to retake it .

You won’t always get the highest grade in the class and it’s okay to be average. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I won’t get As in all my classes at Columbia, let alone my mathematics classes. What I recommend, as others have suggested is to go to office hours. They may not be that helpful but the relationship you establish with the Professor will pay off in the long run especially when applying to graduate school. Secondly, find a community/activities to occupy yourself when you’re not studying. The application process for grad school is holistic and you’ll want to have a compelling story to win them over.

At the end of the day, grades only define a part of you not YOU entirely. Focus on yourself and just continue to try your best. The best advice I got when I arrived here is to not compare myself to the other students. We all come from different backgrounds so while some of us have a head start a larger group of us have to play catch up until we walk across that stage.

How do people find it so easy here? How do I bounce back from shit grades?,,"I have a handful of comments/suggestions as someone also planning to go to grad school

1. First, do not even care about your humanities classes. This semester I got a B+ in a class that has a 90% A-range professor and I didn't bat an eye, simply because I know this will not affect me in the long run. Grad schools care about your ability to do research in the field you apply in, and if you are applying under a technical field it really wont matter how badly you do in ArtHum. 
2. As far as your grades in your math classes are concerned, I am curious to hear about which classes you are talking about. The mean grade is usually around a B+/A- and in more harshly curved classes a B/B+. This means, as long as you have a better understanding of the concept than the majority of the class then you will get at least an A-. This is easier said than done, but in most cases very doable, and if not you are probably studying incorrectly, which leads me to my next point.
3. Studying for math/technical subjects is not an hours in gets hours out subject. What I mean by this is that you can study for 80 hours and make zero progress which is unlikely many other fields (biology, humanities). In fact I think of learning math like a piecewise function, you are at a ""0"" level of understanding for a really long time, and then all of a sudden everything ""clicks"" and you never realize how you didnt understand the concept before. Thus, you have to give yourself plenty of time to really absorb the material and think about it in a lot of different ways, especially for challenging proof classes like real analysis(if your C+ came in something like Calc then you need to reevaluate your study strategy even more)
4. The GRE is more of a cutoff thing, study to do well but it wont give you any edge in getting in anywhere, it just wont hurt you.
5. I've done research every summer by simply emailing professors. Sure, a couple might respond, but usually a lot are willing to chat with you; show up and be enthusiastic and do your homework on their research and they will very likely give you a chance.",4,,False,eotccje,False,False,1558838682.0,2019-05-25 21:44:42

Ehhh... Charles Ives made ""sounding like shit"" into ""high art"" if you study his Circus piece. Generally, marching bands are held to a different standard of ""musicianship"" over formal concert orchestra. Typically, the social standard for members of marching bands are more closely related to expectations dictated by the members of athletics department, Greek life... These are just my observations though.

What are some good and bad things about Columbia?,sometimeInJune,"Good: 

-Awesome education, regardless of your major. 

-You’ll be very prepared to critically evaluate the world / society and you’ll be able to add interesting insights to most conversations you participate in.

-The job scene is fire. You’re at the best school in the hottest job location in the US.

-Your network is thoroughly intertwined with the hottest job location in the US.

-You will be pushed by your peers. You’re constantly in a 100 MPH zone, and you’ll notice if you let up the gas. 

-NYC culture bleeds into Columbia, pushing you beyond your limits and stretching you to learn all about and pursue opportunity.

-The most cultured and diverse Ivy. You won’t be brushing elbows with mostly Connecticut prep kids. Rich kids are still prevalent, but they’re much more low key than at other schools. Plus, since Columbia is in NYC, socioeconomic issues really hit home and are not ignored.


Bad:

-Pressure cooker. If you let up and take it easy, you’ll probably feel like you’re falling behind (which you will be).

-Lack of school spirit. There is community to be found at Columbia, absolutely, but it’s harder to find than at a big sports school. 

-NYC culture bleeds into Columbia, creating a dog eat dog environment sometimes.

-Complain culture. You know those bloggers who just always say stuff like “2 Blessd 2 B stressed”? Columbia is the opposite of that. People flaunt and exacerbate their stressors to a fault.",22,,1591665178.0,ftfbfud,False,False,1591661548.0,2020-06-08 19:12:28
What are some good and bad things about Columbia?,Neitsch1,"I did the 3-2 program (3 years at a liberal arts college, then 2yrs at CU). I personally was a little disappointed in CU. While it does have pretty rigorous classes and world class teachers, I got more out of my liberal arts education. The soft skills I took away from there were and are incredibly valuable in my career and it really helped me come out of my shell. Meanwhile at CU I felt that many people were simply to stressed to enjoy their time and grow. However, CU is obviously a fantastic name to have on your resume and opens many many doors. I'm sure others had a more positive experience,  but I don't think that you get enough out of it considering the tuition. Based on my personal experience I would recommend choosing a liberal arts college outside of a major city. If it's not enough for you (like it was for me) then enroll in the 3-2 program. And otherwise you can also always get a master at CU. With the master you will probably get more bang for your buck.

What are some good and bad things about Columbia?,TexasHellYeah,"As demonstrated by TheMoreOne, some bad things do include that the students don't often transfer the knowledge base/critical lens they supposedly learn in class to regular life - somehow the assumption was drawn that you were a junior transfer? I believe the more likely option is that you're a junior in high school looking for some inspiration, but I could be wrong and feel free to correct me!   


To breakdown the why you should and why you shouldn't apply to Columbia:   


Why you should:   
Connections. The Columbia name does open doors, and if you're going into finance, being in the middle of NYC certainly helps in getting you that network.   
Community. Columbia, after all, is still an Ivy, and tends to attract some of the best and brightest of the country. Sure, people on this sub will shit on that, but at the end of the day, the people here, even if often are born into immense wealth and privilege, do tend to have larger knowledge bases than most universities. With that in mind, you'll be able to partake in really great intellectual discourse that will challenge why you think the way that you do, and is a really great mentally stimulant.   


Why you shouldn't:   
You just want to become more book smart. I strongly believe that the value of an Ivy education is not the actual book edumacatin', it's more on the people that Ivies tend to attract. If you just want to bury your nose in a book for your four undergrad years, there are many more schools that offer that, without the price tag.

The Columbia name carries weight. I garnered way more interest in internship applications with Columbia on my resume vs the state school I previously attended.

The biggest downside imo is the lack of school spirit. People should be happy to go here.

How do you guys manage your time,B00YouWhore,"No prob.
Okay so I have a to do notebook. It’s always a small moleskin brand notebook - but doesn’t have to be. I keep it in my back pocket. Always. 
I write a basic daily meeting/class time schedule on one page a day with the date in the upper right corner for later reference. This has saved my butt in the past. It’s basically a calendar of the first mention of many papers and projects. 

I leave space between each meeting/class for extra activities in between if the courses aren’t back to back. I also write the beginning and ending time of the courses and the breaks beside the shorthand like “Anthro22” so I have a good concept of time. This time keeping is useful in that it tells me not to plan something hefty or time consuming during a shorter break period but rather something small and quick - saving large tasks for larger break periods. 

Throughout the day I add to the daily schedule. 
If there’s a big task like an essay due in 5 days the first day I plan to go through the reading and write out ideas and aspects I’d like to address. Second day I outline all my ideas by paragraph down to the greatest detail I can. 
Third day I do the first draft - which is mostly done via the outline so it’s easy. 
Fourth day I finish the final draft. 
Fifth day I rest and review it. 
Each day is simple and I always leave leeway for any road bumps that set me back. 

The important thing is that it should be quick. 

Every box to check is a piece of a larger task or a small task and so boxes fill up quick. I end up getting addicted to filling the boxes because it’s so easy - cause they’re all simple. 

I never have to worry about forgetting something because that notebook goes everywhere with me and is always being added to. When the sun goes down I’m usually done with my to do or I’ve dealt with chunks of larger projects due later and I stop working and relax. Stress doesn’t help memory. Late nights cramming screw up recall big time and often make you crash so you get further behind. (That’s what I’ve seen happen to others.)

I don't think my classes were styled after the traditional class style like you'd find with the undergrad. students. 

So a class like health systems would be taken throughout an entire semester, but would be split in three parts wwith roughly the first month focused on health econ, 2nd month focused on US healthcare policy, and 3rd month focused on comparative healthcare policy (international systems). Each of these parts would have their own final type exam or paper.*

That said, I cut out video games and Netflix/Hulu substantially. I would still take time to hang with friends during the weekends, explore NYC, and play some video games, but pretty much I just tried to get a head start on assignments and actually do the readings (what a concept! haha). Office hours definitely helped a ton since these are students who took the class and understood the material. I don't study well in groups since it devolves almost always into a hangout with little real work actually done.

2) The band doesn't ""interrupt study"" by doing Orgo Night. If that was the purpose of Orgo Night 35 years ago, that's not what it does now. The band takes up one room for two hours on one day of the semester. Anyone who needs to study knows to use one of Columbia's half-dozen other open libraries during that time, or any other of Butler's rooms. The symbolic turning of a study space into a celebratory one during finals does more good than harm.

second, i would not expect columbia to ever not be frustrating.  for every competent person actually helping run the university, there are a dozen more who have no clue what the fuck it means to run a university, somehow have more power, and care only about the supposed prestige of their fancy job titles.  the few exceptions to this usually find better jobs elsewhere sooner than later.

third, eventually you will find those exceptions, so don't fret, but recognize that it will probably take time to find someone competent, responsive, and who actually cares.  especially now.  for the most part the administrators are getting the shit end of every stick, so try to be cognizant of that as well.

fourth, given the aforementioned shit sticks, i doubt your email is going to improve your situation.  i would suggest following up with an apology for the rant and a concise and clear list of questions and issues that you need addressed.  the exceptions are holding things together right now as best they can.

Yeah. I think I'm perhaps making the mistake that my age as a 30 yr. old who has worked in a semi-professional capacity confers some perspective when considering my experience.

Of course I was initially very patient and cordial, but when I felt that my patienc had been tested, I expressed that, and sadly that has, to give an example, made the request of five transcripts reduce to 1 instantaneously.
I worry that there is this expectation by the faculty that they are dealing with a rather young population and so there is more they can get away with.
I notice they will make demands or ask for payments without transparency.

"Fellow international students, are you going back to campus in fall?",chobani-,"Not an intl student, but I have many friends who are. 

Correct me if I’m misreading you, but your main reason for coming back would be to have a quieter/more effective learning environment. Are there libraries or quiet spaces in your home area that you could study in? You should also consider the fact that housing/financial/insurance challenges would detract from your learning experience as well. 

I would *not* recommend coming back to the US right now if you have any other options. Our pandemic response is a global joke and shows no signs of improvement; we’re projected to hit 100k cases a day soon. You don’t want to deal with that if you can avoid it. Also, if Columbia needs to close again (a very possible scenario), would you be able to quickly get home? Would you be willing to remain in the US?

Renting up a place in NYC/anywhere in the US seems also impossible due to financial reasons, so for me, it’s a tradeoff between an unpleasant online experience and a campus life that might pose health risks.

Community Food and Juice has fantastic food for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. I'd call it modern American. Cons? Busy and expensive (expect to spend $25-30 a person total)

Massawa, an Ethiopian restaurant. Good food, different vibe. You eat with your hands! Also a little pricier, expect $25-35 a person.

Wu+Nussbaum is often recommended for dumplings - they ain't it. While they have honestly quite impressive Chinese entrees, their dumplings leave quite a bit to be desired. (To be clear, I'm evaluating them from what is generally perceived to be a high quality authentic dumpling, in which case Wu+Nussbaum has ridiculously thick dumpling skins that just don't work)

There are plenty of restaurants around the area, and it's really up to you in terms of what you want. I would say within 10 blocks of Columbia, there's no real standout restaurant for all the factors that matter to me: price, quantity of food, and quality of food.

What was the last recession like for Columbia students/new grads?,Bure96,"I graduated in 2009.

In March 2009, only a matter of weeks before graduation, I found out that the company had eliminated their associate program and I was suddenly out of a job. I ended up finding a job as a paralegal at a small law firm and decided to go to law school instead. Applications at my law school were up 50% that year. Guess I wasn’t the only person who had the law school idea.

I also had a number of friends who graduated a year or two before me and got jobs at investment banks, were working insane hours, and then lost their jobs during the recession. Most didn’t get their bonuses either.",20,,False,exz2vi6,False,False,1566660239.0,2019-08-24 10:23:59
What was the last recession like for Columbia students/new grads?,RaawrImAMonster,"I was in the engineering school from 2008-2012. It was an interesting time for sure. I knew a few people who had been laid off from their jobs on wall street and joined doctorate programs (in engineering) to ride out the recession. I’ve heard a few stories about tech companies that didn’t lay people off, but they certainly weren’t hiring. 

Internships were definitely hard to come by, but it’s really dependent on your major. There will always be fewer internships than full time jobs and additionally for a company, the internship is a really solid interview process. Three months of pay is way cheaper to them than hiring a dud. 

For computer science, you have to understand that the job market was completely different. When I started college in 2008, people were saying that CS was a fun, but impractical major because there weren’t many jobs in it. By the time I graduated in 2012, we had companies like FB and Google looking to recruit anyone with an engineering degree who could program. I think the software industry has grown immensely since then, but the number of students in the field has also grown to accommodate so they can be more selective. That said, there are definitely way more jobs in CS today compared to 2012. There would still be more if half disappeared due to a recession. 

It’s interesting you mentioned the trays because they actually did take them away at Columbia too. They did say it was to save money and water. I hadn’t made the connection at the time.",6,,False,exzjnwr,False,False,1566667226.0,2019-08-24 12:20:26
What was the last recession like for Columbia students/new grads?,womcauliff,"I studied 2010 - 2014, compsci major.

Occupy Wall Street started 2011, which meant it was happening during my sophomore year when we all take contemporary civilization. It was on our minds for a lot of the readings (Adam Smith, Marx, De Tocqueville). I remember hearing that Columbia students were going downtown to protest (and getting arrested). It felt like we were watching pivotal moment of history. The Arab Spring was the year before and that managed overthrew governments, so it wasn't unreasonable to think that OWS protestors could change America in a significant way.

I can't speak to how finance career changed, but over the course of my four years at Columbia I saw an huge surge in interest in CompSci and tech careers at internet companies. Instagram and Snapchat both launched and exploded in popularity in that timeframe. Spotify launched in the United States. Facebook went public. After a decade JavaScript finally got updates with ES5 and ES6. We saw the rise of websites built as Single-Page Apps, and npm. It was definitely an exciting time to be studying how to code and while I did have plenty of friends who went into investment banking, landing a job at a tech giant was viewed really favorably.",10,,False,exzkiq6,False,False,1566667602.0,2019-08-24 12:26:42

I ended up going to grad school and so did all my friends from non-wealthy families.

Experience with online classes this past semester?,ThePolychromat,"Honestly - while I don’t doubt next semester’s classes will be competently taught, it’s not just about the material. It’s about meeting people and all the experiences the city has to offer. It’s really lonely taking classes online (even as a senior with an established friend group), and I can’t imagine starting my first year remote. Adjusting to college is hard enough already (I also think Core classes are just more fun in person). You just meet so many people in your intro classes, and they stick with you for the next four years - and it’s hard to reach out to people when you’re all online. You don’t just run into people around campus or chat before class or meet each other in the floor lounge.

I honestly think if you’re in a position to do so, you should seriously consider deferring if classes are online. It’ll also buy you time to figure out your career goals if we’re heading into a recession. Personally, I probably wouldn’t have deferred myself for practical reasons - a combination of pushy parents and wanting to jump into industry.

But then again, maybe I’m just thinking like an old person - I’m sure people will find a way to make the most of the circumstances, whatever they may be. *Different* doesn’t necessarily equal *worse*.",27,,False,fqi2xds,False,False,1589388967.0,2020-05-13 11:56:07

I think taking a gap year is generally a good idea, but if everything is still closed in the fall there might not be much for you to do. You could still probably figure out some cool things for the winter/spring at least. 

But yeah, if you're coming in as a freshman to online classes you're not going to get the same experiences meeting people and it would honestly be a huge loss - like absolutely massive. Though it would probably only be for a semester, and it sounds like there may be a full summer semester so you could probably recuperate the time.

In terms of learning, for STEM courses I think it's pretty similar. If you're motivated in the core classes you can still learn a decent amount. But overall experience not the same at all.

However, taking a gap year, ONLY if you have some productive things you want to work on and the financial capability to do so, is a great idea. It’s amazing to have a years worth of free time to learn more about yourself and what you enjoy, especially knowing that if what you do ends up fruitless you’re going to just go back to school anyway. It’s not an opportunity you will really ever get again, especially because it’s a massive pain in the ass to take a gap year once you actually start at Columbia.

Anybody got a message from president Bolinger?,LopsidedInteraction,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I am writing with another update, this time primarily to begin thinking ahead to the next academic year. Under the extraordinary and painful conditions of the pandemic, our minds are, by necessity, fixed on coping with the present. But, by inclination and by the sheer march of time, we also have to make plans for the future. We have collectively done so for this semester, and then for the summer, and now we need to bring our attention to the fall semester and next academic year. The purpose of this message is to say that this process is now underway.

It is true that in a crisis, such as the one we are now experiencing, the almost incomprehensible variables and uncertainties that characterize the moment often make definitive decisions unwise. That said, I want to affirm that Columbia will be proceeding with the 2020-2021 academic year. Over the next two months, I and others will write with more detail about how we will do that. I have no doubt, however, that whatever form our pursuit and application of knowledge takes we will be called upon to manifest a steady and determined effort and to achieve the highest levels of creativity we can summon. We are open, but we are and will be open in new ways, including those we have not yet discovered. Some of what we will do will be new but will change back when normality returns, and for good reason, because these activities and practices have been developed and refined over centuries. I’m thinking here especially of the art of personal intellectual discussion. Other things, however, we will invent afresh, and keep, and the Columbia decades from now will be richer for them. You will hear from me soon about ideas that are emerging.

Columbia is many parts. The colleges, schools, departments, institutes, and centers each will have somewhat different plans for the future given the different impacts of the circumstances in which they find themselves. Our central challenge, however, will be accommodating the undergraduate residential system in a period of ongoing risk resulting from COVID-19. Needless to say, we want everyone back just as soon as that can be accomplished with the level of safety we insist upon. As I indicated, we will know much more in the next several weeks. In the meantime, I have asked Ira Katznelson and Dr. Lee Goldman to expand our COVID-19 Task Force, which has been the bedrock of recommendations for the University in confronting the crisis, to have subcommittees address large issues of research, education, facilities, finances, and campus life. These groups are formed and will begin reporting back soon. I want to express our shared gratitude to the members of the administration and faculty who are literally devoting themselves to these institutional issues. 

Just one more thing. I try in these notes to add something about what the University is doing so that we can all have a fuller sense of pride in Columbia. I’d like to speak about our nearby communities. We are trying our best to help those closest to us in these dire moments. Our faculty are lending their expertise on public health and other urgent issues through a local media partnership with the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. And our Columbia-Harlem Small Business Development Center (SBDC), which is connected to Columbia Business School, is helping hundreds of local enterprises to secure emergency federal loans. We have also offered two months in rent abatement for our small-business tenants, and we are preparing to launch a loan program, in partnership with the SBDC and the Business School, to help local shops, restaurants, and other small firms to reopen.
 
I would like to close by saying that, while the virus continues to have its devastating effects on the lives of everyone, our medical and public health experts confirm that our policies and practices in New York City, the State, and the nation (as well as around the globe) are working, as witnessed in our own Medical Center, to reduce the escalation of severe illness to levels from which we can begin to bring our world back into some order. Especially for these individual acts of personal responsibility, we can also feel pride and hope for the future. For this, I am forever grateful.

Again, from the President’s House, Jean and I send our warmest wishes.

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger",5,,False,fobhleg,False,False,1587659879.0,2020-04-23 11:37:59

If you really want to go to Columbia, you can. You just need to put your head down and put the work in.

I had several leadership positions at my old school and took advantage of the internship opportunities of the city that I was in (but also made sure to have as much fun as possible!) 

I definitely second what u/thetoriroeo said, make sure you have strong recommendation letters and that you have a good relationship with your recommenders. Have your friends or maybe even current professors read over your essays. I found attending my previous school to be a lot more enjoyable than Columbia, but I'm a senior currently missing senior spring and regretting complaining so much about Columbia, I miss it a lot. If you come to Columbia, I'd tell you to meet as many people as possible, to study hard but not take your work THAT seriously and to make the most of your college experience.

Contesting Grades,lordhrath,"At least from the GS website:

## Grade Appeals and Grade Changes

Assessment of a student's performance in a course is at the instructor's discretion. When a student feels a grade appeal is warranted, the student should first speak with the instructor of the course in order to understand how the evaluation was derived or to clarify other specific concerns. **If dissatisfied with the explanation or uncomfortable broaching this matter with the instructor, the student should speak with the director of undergraduate studies or, if appropriate, the chair of the relevant department.**

**Deans and GS advisors can counsel** a student on whether and how to approach an instructor about a grade appeal; however, they do not arbitrate grade disputes. Students should keep their GS advisors informed of any pending grade disputes or appeals, as the **Office of the Dean of Students can help to expedite** a response from a faculty member or department.

**If the student is unable to resolve the matter** to his or her satisfaction and believes that a **procedural issue** is involved, the student should bring the matter to the attention of the **GS Dean of Academic Affairs** who will work with the student and the faculty member to determine whether there has been a procedural breach and, if so, take immediate steps to remedy the matter. If relevant faculty other than the instructor, in consultation with GS Academic Affairs, decide that the grade or other academic evaluation was appropriate, given class assignments and circumstances, the student will be informed and the decision will be final.

The statute of limitations on final grade appeals is three months from the end of the semester in which the course was taken.

Sort of unrelated, but the 1968 protests fucked Columbia up for decades, and much of it was over a freakin gym being built.  Also, Columbia losing government contracts was detrimental to its research output.  Recall that the first atom split in America was split in Pupin iirc, which stemmed from govt research.

Why are there so many bigots on bored@butler? It breaks my heart,,">Oh did your feelings get hurt because of my ""negative metaphor""?

Descriptions of shit eating summon disgusting images into a person's mind.  Those images are disturbing to anyone with normal sensibilities.  It's a rhetorical ""cheap trick."" If your point stood on its own you wouldn't need to resort to such techniques. 

> You are just being intellectually dishonest to escape valid criticism.

You didn't criticise me, I was a third party.  I am not OP.  Your analysis of the situation is only partly correct.  I don't see the original comment on women as bigoted.  Misinformed and/or confused, yes, but not bigoted.  So in that you are right. But OPs response is not bigoted.  OP said nothing intolerant.  OP said ""it breaks my heart"" which is a simple emotional reaction to a situation.  OP used the loaded word ""bigot"" which some think of as a slight or an insult.  But in that case it's a descriptive and necessary word that clearly makes OP's point, not unnecessary color like your shit-eating analogy.  If someone instantly gets incensed the minute the word ""bigot"" is used I would wonder about that person's ability to handle criticism.  Speaking of criticism.

Can share what the emails says about summer enrollment? Does it exactly say that summer enrollment is necessary? It seems strange that it would be a requirement and not just a suggestion. 

Regarding relocating, NYC is going to be extremely difficult to live in over the next year. Cramp apartments, packed subway trains, difficulties with grocery shopping, these are all normal New York struggles but add the virus in the mix and it’s a whole different challenge.

Assuming you're a college senior looking toward undergrad, that is.

Columbia is better by most metrics, and my experience on both sides of the private sector hiring process suggests that the prestige of your undergrad does matter somewhat (this may be less true if you're going to grad school or a very specialized profession--but, again, we're hedging our bets in case you change your mind).

Columbia gives you more opportunities once you’re done with college. Companies in nyc come to Columbia to recruit students, they don’t go all out of their way to go to New Jersey.

Even if the city is ""ready"" by then, this may not point towards schools like Columbia, NYU being ready for students, especially considering the fact that some dorms have been converted into makeshift medical spaces.

My advice - talk with your (potential) advisor, program head. Get their advice. Be in touch with other students in your program, your graduating class to see what they are doing. If you can, get in contact with appropriate administrative figures, like the dean of your school. Most importantly, talk with your parents. Get their advice, especially if they are flipping the bill.

In addition, keep an eye on the news coming out of NYC, in places like Manhattan and use your judgement from there.

Absolutely DO NOT do the most as far as course overload. Chill out. I did 9 credits my first semester then moved up to 12 and it is kicking my ass especially since they are no longer intro classes.

What benefits does Columbia receive from the Columbia-Barnard relationship?,nsgomez,"Just to add to the comments that have already been made:

* Barnard and Columbia have an agreement where Barnard pays Columbia for access to its facilities. It's not a flat fee, though, it actually varies from year to year depending on how many Barnard students use Columbia's facilities (and vice versa). In 2017 it was about $6 million.^[1]
* Despite being a financially independent institution, Barnard is *academically* integrated with the rest of the university. Aside from the fact that Barnard students get Columbia degrees, I think this is most apparent in the fact that Barnard has minority control in its own tenuring process, with Columbia holding veto power at multiple stages.^[2]
* I think context matters here. Barnard and TC both came to be separate-but-affiliated institutions mostly because of Columbia being near-insolvent and really sexist in its early years. Chapter 6 of [this book on JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7312/dolk07850?turn_away=true&refreqid=excelsior%3A91567fa9b274e26eb3a8a1222d474867&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) does a good job giving the context for both schools' founding. (One ""fun fact"" I learned is that TC tried to consolidate with Columbia, but its proposal was rejected.)

On top of that, Columbia students can enroll in Barnard classes, which typically have smaller class sizes.

There is also the added benefit of a greater diversity of viewpoints. For example, the Barnard Economics Department tends to be more liberal and Columbia more conservative.

What benefits does Columbia receive from the Columbia-Barnard relationship?,SupaPreme,"Isn't Barnard's acceptance rate for undergrad almost twice that of the acceptance rate for Columbia College and Columbia Engineering, combined? I think Barnard also has a lower median SAT.

Technically though, it's Barnard College at Columbia University and students from Barnard are conferred a degree from Columbia University.

However, they are independent institutions. The board of trustees for Columbia College/Columbia Engineering/Columbia GS is different from Barnard. Also ,the finances for Columbia College/Columbia Engineering/Columbia GS roll up into Columbia University. Barnard does not. Budgeting here at Columbia University hardly ever includes Barnard as they have their own financial reporting.

To say Barnard IS Columbia University is incorrect. Barnard has a very close ***partnership*** with Columbia University, but it isn't Columbia University. Barnard students even get a different ID as opposed to students in Columbia College/Columbia Engineering/Columbia GS. It would be more correct to say Barnard is a part of Columbia University.

I'ts slightly similar to Hunter College / CCNY / Baruch College (at least that's the best I could think of). They are all a part of CUNY. Is Hunter College, CCNY? No. Is Hunter, Baruch?

"How much of a ""golden ticket"" is a Columbia degree career-wise?",OutofH2G2references,"I think I have a unique experience/experiment here since I’ve actually experienced a mix.

I went to state school for under grad, Columbia for a post bac/a bit of research, and a pretty good private school for my PhD. I now work at Duke as a researcher.

I’ve been out of grad school and at Duke long enough to tell you that my Columbia email gets more opens and responses than my other 3 emails. No question.

Even though I published papers at my good private school, people at conferences are more interested in who I worked with at Columbia before I even went to grad school.

When I network at conferences, it’s my Columbia contacts that work in my favor. Even though they are now 5-6 years old.

Here is the advice I give young people: If you can get in to a school like Columbia, do it. There really are benefits. But if you can’t and you’re considering a state school vs a “good” private school, go to state school. The additional cost of private schools are crazy and they don’t confer a proportional benefit. Decent state schools on the other hand are much less expensive and usually are “you get what you put in”.

Columbia isn’t a golden ticket. It just significantly ups the chances that someone will look at your resume, listen to you at a conference, or will know someone you know. ",48,,1539221165.0,e7jrj2k,False,False,1539220300.0,2018-10-10 20:11:40
"How much of a ""golden ticket"" is a Columbia degree career-wise?",coronavitae,"I have a weird story, but I definitely found it helped:

I initially felt like a columbia degree was most beneficial for on-campus recruiting. You really get your foot in the door for a shit-ton of firms that way, but I missed that boat (don't do your senior thesis first semester of senior year).

I quickly found out that an incredible number of international graduate schools were very psyched about having a Columbia student, and people abroad in general were much more impressed by the name than they were in the states. I got a lot of scholarships despite not making cum laude or any other graduation honors.

Ultimately I think the Columbia name did a lot to get me into a later graduate program in the states, and one of my Columbia connections got me my job after graduation. He literally called them and told them to take me.

I am very glad I did not go to a much more economical state school.",17,,False,e7jsnv2,False,False,1539221455.0,2018-10-10 20:30:55

But depends on if you want to goto grad school. In the law school, there are loads of people from such “lower” schools, but that “lesser” pedigree means nothing in comparison to their law school pedigree. Of course, it’s probably easier getting into a top grad school with the Columbia name on your resume, but if you can still get a great GPA and have much less debt from undergrad, I think you’ll be just as fine. 


Ultimately, I think the calculation is almost impossible to run a priori. Loads of debt for prestige, versus no debt and no prestige. Both can end up in the exact same place. And you really can’t appreciate how >$100k in debt will feel >4 years down the road when you have no sense of what job you’ll have or where you’ll be living.

I went a well regarded state university for undergrad and most of the top tech/finance companies didn’t actively recruit on campus. A few of my friends went on to work at companies like that but they were exceptional people and often had connections through friends or family. A few years out we were all doing fairly well so the well known state university was a great deal. If I went to a lesser known state university or expensive private school I may not feel this way.

However, Columbia is a target school for most of those companies and many of my peers from grad school went to top firms directly after graduation.

ED English Applicant Questions (Pls help),kitachi3,"As far as I’m aware, the major you apply for doesn’t influence competitiveness—Columbia admits students by school, not major. Both of those majors are in the college so one wouldn’t put you at a disadvantage over the other. 

To my understanding, legacy status gives you a positive nudge but by no means will get you accepted by itself; if the school has to pick between two similar applicants and one is a legacy, they’ll pick the legacy. That being said, I’m not an admissions officer so take that with a grain of salt",18,,False,fvlw1bn,False,False,1592801346.0,2020-06-21 23:49:06

also, word of advice, try not to compare yourself to other applicants! Columbia does not have a set benchmark of the students they accept, they seem to just want passionate, intellectual students who truly care about what they do. take a deep breath and let the stress out, you’ll get through this and however it turns out you’re still a great student with a love of writing :) don’t measure your self-worth on the schools you get into, you’re still the same human being whether you are accepted or not",7,,False,fvlxwje,False,False,1592802757.0,2020-06-22 00:12:37
ED English Applicant Questions (Pls help),powellstreetcinema,"Planned major shouldn’t affect any eligibility concerns.

Creative Writing, like Comp Lit, does however require an application. They’re both more selective than the English department, but I wouldn’t let that deter you if you are really interested. FWIW, you can take some Fiction workshops and Comp Lit courses even if you’re not part of the major. That’s what I do as a current English undergrad. You won’t really be making the decision of your major until sophomore year, so I would just worry about getting your ducks in a row for your application to Columbia itself before you start worrying about being prepared for the major.

In the meantime, you can peruse the departments’  webpages to see expectations, department news, and course offerings. Seeing those should give you a better idea of the differences between the programs.

As for what it’s like to be an English major: there is a robust mix of large lecture courses as well as small seminars although the majority of your time spent within major courses will probably be in seminars. For these basically you read a book a week then come to a two hour class once a week and take part in a guided discussion about the text. Generally, you’ll write two papers for the course, one 5-7 page paper for the midterm and a 10-12 or 12-15 page paper for the final. You’ll also give a 5-10 minute presentation at some point in the semester about whichever text you elect to. Some courses require a little more, some require a little less. Your grade for the course will be based on these and also on participation. Between my major courses and electives, I usually read something like 300 pages a week. Obviously this isn’t always all close-reading. You’ll get a system down for how to prioritize your reading.

ED English Applicant Questions (Pls help),lordofthefiles28,"Hey! I’m a prospective creative writing major (I’ll be applying this year so not in just yet, but things are looking good so fingers crossed) who’s taken lots of creative writing and English classes already. Like others have said, intended major doesn’t really affect your chances of getting in; however, you do want to make sure it doesn’t seem totally out of left field for your background and the overall narrative you present in your application. Like, if you’ve been doing physics research your whole life and that consumed all your Activities slots on the Common App, it might raise some eyebrows to see you apply as an English major with no explanation. Other than that, I would absolutely encourage majoring in English or creative writing at Columbia. The professors are incredible. Truly, life-changing. The best I’ve had at this school, and the classes have been the ones that really made me think. The creative writing department is small, but in a way that feels cozy instead of confining. They offer opportunities for students to read and share their work, host published authors to come talk to us, and mainly offer small workshop classes with students who also love writing (and are damn good at it).

ED English Applicant Questions (Pls help),ThatsWhatSheErised,"1. Columbia doesn't accept based on major, but if you're worried about it you can apply as whatever major you want. You're not in any way bound to it, you don't really start taking your major classes or officially declare until your sophomore year anyways.

2. See point 1.

3. No idea, I'm in CS. I imagine you write a lot.

4. Being a legacy does give you an advantage. Some students have a negative view of giving legacy admits an upper hand, but their issue is more with the program than the people. I don't think legacy students really face any day to day problems. If you're really self conscious about it no one has to know.  
As far as accomplishments go, don't compare your behind the scenes to everyone else's highlight reels. Everyone here at some point or another experiences imposter syndrome, don't do this to yourself before you even apply.

Update on COVID-19 From Prezbo,,"I don't think (or at least I hope) that prezbo made the decision on the basis of ""fairness"" in terms of equality of outcome. 

Heres why I think the decision actually makes sense though: 

Classes this semester are in no way standardized. That is, cheating in these settings is way too easy as well as a lack of quality instruction in terms of seminar discussions or participation/lab work in other cases. That means that if students were opting into a grade based policy, it would imply that they were automatically in the top x% of the class, which is already skewed towards kids that have no qualms cheating, etc. Furthermore, kids like me who are already into grad school will simply automatically P/F the class and not try, so the grade distribution is again fucked.

That being said, if I were in my junior year, I would also be fuming, but the decision is ""fair"". Now, whether its the correct decision is different, but what I will say is you either need to do all letter grading, or all P/F in the interest of fairness for the reasons I described above. If you do optional, then this creates distributions that are unfavorable and devalues the meaning of every other  'A' grade at columbia.",8,,False,fl2ivft,False,False,1584752070.0,2020-03-20 19:54:30

Update on COVID-19 From Prezbo,,"My argument never revolved around my grade falling. My argument revolved around an inaccurate distribution of grades because of optional pass fail. For example, let's take a Real Analysis math class which is crucial for grad school admissions for math. Normally, the distribution will be something like 35% A-range grades with an A grade meaning that you really understood analysis. Now this distribution itself is critical because your real analysis grade needs to MEAN something for admissions. Now take the optional pass fail grade. There is no way to ensure that people will not look up proofs/get someone to help with the proofs. So this splits the curve bimodally, lets say 50% get near a 100 on the tests and the other 50 get a 50 on the test, so the curve at the end looks like 50% A grades and 50% pass grades. What does an admissions officer do in this case? They have no assurance that the analysis grade meant/stood for anything.

I dont even understand how your second question relates, but no, I don't believe in helping people who willingly incurred debt. 

And of course it results in more cheating. Any exam that is ""take-home"" will be cheated on more whether you believe it or not.",3,,False,fl2khkl,False,False,1584753179.0,2020-03-20 20:12:59

It was like a sauna in my room, and we had to open windows to cope. I could no longer turn the heat down myself because of the radiator cover, so I spoke to the super about it. Super says the app to control the heat isn't ready yet, so I have to submit a maintenance request to turn the heat down. I submit the maintenance request, checking off that it's OK for them to enter if I'm not there. Three business days later, they show up when I'm not there, and report back that the radiator was working fine and nothing was broken. I submit another request, this time explaining my problem in very simple language and mentioning the frickin' $600+ bill I got from Con Ed. I speak with the super again, who tells me that I never should have signed up with Con Ed in the first place because the steam heat in the building is covered by the school.

So I haggle with Con Ed, who threatens to shut off my heat (please do, I said), and eventually get a credit for that horrible bill.

So most top law schools provide financial support to students who do unpaid internships during their first summer. Many schools just give you a block grant.

So much back and forth over a meaningless timesheet that served no purpose because we were only going to get a specified amount over the summer anyways. 

But THEN! Near the end of the summer they sent out an email “clarifying” that if you worked overtime hours then you could receive additional pay. Most law jobs have long hours... And the email was incredibly condescending, blaming students themselves for misinterpreting instructions (pissed off, I went back and found the email where they had previously said specifically that the pay was capped).  

And then they mailed my last check... to themselves! Running late on a rent payment, and I’m on the phone with them asking where the hell my money went. I told them I’d just stop by their office and pick it up myself. No one showed up until around 10:30...

Good places for food in the area?,panaceic,"some of these are a bit of a trek depending on how much you want to walk, but here's a list of my (heavily asian) favorites:

* jin ramen (125th & broadway)
* uncle luoyang cart (around 118th & broadway) - my favorite food cart; you get a huge amount of food for just $7
* gongcha (109th & broadway) - amazing bubble tea; will probably put tea magic out of business tbh
* 108 food dried hot pot (108th & broadway) - dry hot pot; basically, you pick vegetables/meats (pay per pound) and they'll cook it up for you; avoid if you don't like spicy food
* taqueria y fonda (108th & amsterdam) - incredible tacos
* thai market (107th & amsterdam)
* saiguette (106th & columbus) - great banh mi
* tum & yum (105th & columbus) - probably the best thai in the area, but a bit farther than thai market
* xi'an famous foods (102nd & broadway) - amazing hand pulled noodles; the pork sandwiches here are also insane

and of course, there's a bunch of places from 116th to 110th on broadway. my top few:

* milano market (113th & broadway) - half off sushi after 10 PM each day, salads and sandwiches are also pretty good
* dig inn (broadway b/w 112th & 113th st) - unhealthy healthy food
* junzi kitchen (113th & broadway) - make your own noodle bowls; this is the only place i'm kind of hesitant to suggest b/c the novelty is cool, but a lot of pairings i've tried taste pretty mediocre",21,,False,ebcdfxk,False,False,1544254344.0,2018-12-08 01:32:24

"Current Columbia students, how is the food at Columbia(in terms of meal plan)? Do y’all mostly eat outside or in school?",TexasHellYeah,"Here's the honest to god evaluation of a first year student on a meal plan: 

It's not bad. It's not great.

Rated as the top dining hall in the nation, I was expecting better. 

As a dining hall in general, especially as university dining halls go, it's decent. 

As people have already said repeatedly, the dining halls have their on days and off days. I would like to point out that anything chicken except for their chicken parm is extraordinarily dry. 

You'll come to find out that Ferris doesn't understand the concept of lunch - they only serve brunch, weekends or weekdays be damned. 

Also, Google Reviews claim(s) (I'm not entirely sure if Google Reviews is to be approached as a singularity or a plurality...) that both Ferris and John Jay are ""Fine Dining"". That's a hilarious joke. Once again, they're not bad for dining halls, but fine dining? Please. Chipotle has finer fries, and Chipotle doesn't even serve fries.

Personally, I wouldn't say that the dining halls are worth paying for if you're paying without a meal plan, as one entry costs somewhere in the ballpark of $15. Depending on the meal plan you get, I believe it gets reduced to somewhere around $11 a swipe? Not bad. 

Now here's the real life hack: go to the Barnard Dining Hall. It's underground and fantastic. By far better than John Jay, Ferris, or anything. And you really don't even need a meal plan, as one entry costs $8 for lunch, and $11 for dinner. I will admit that sometimes the lines are rather long, and the hours aren't as flexible as your ""Columbia"" options, but they're great quality for a cheaper price. However, you can still use Columbia dining hall swipes there, so should you choose to purchase a meal plan, you can still access the Barnard dining halls.

So the idea is that because black/non-white students are treated differently by security than white students, white students who do not speak up against such actions/policies are tacitly implicit in their occurence because they are benefiting from a discriminatory system. 

Is this how white students are perceived? By some students/student activists typically non-white left/progressive students.

Barnard Public Safety Restrains Student In Milstein Center,Tofon," I agree that they should make it less arbitrary. Imo, the simplest answer is just have a mandatory ID card tap to enter at the gate. There isn't so much traffic that late at night that it would slow people down. Also FWIW, as a white male I've been asked to show ID 2/2 times that I've walked onto campus super late.


As for the pinning, the guy was being super aggressive and confrontational with the officers. At least in the video that I saw he was more aggressive than they were at every single point. If public safety doesn't have the authority to temporarily restrain a student who is starting to act aggressive, I think they probably should. They weren't twisting his arm around or doing anything crazy, and they let him go fairly quickly and let him produce his ID card. If this is what qualifies as ""violence"" (per the bwog article) I really don't know what to say lol. 

He can feel that the rules aren't fair, but that doesn't exempt him from following them.

I also made a conscious decision to take on other obligations by becoming a teaching assistant, for which I get monetary compensation. I am upset because I think I don’t make enough money, and want more benefits added *to my already existing generous benefits package* which includes: $28-30k a year in a stipend, free tuition, and (in some cases) free housing (and if not free, then an extremely subsidized housing unit through school housing).

How are these TAs expecting to live during their time here? Do they expect to be popping bottles on the roof of the Standard every weekend, drinking the bubbly whilst grading papers? Let’s be real: 1) you grade papers. 2) not all of you TAs grade them on time anyway, yet still get paid. “Oh professor I’m so busy I’m trying” ...... You literally look at an answer key and either put a check mark or red X next to something and/or write comments. They signed up for this job and get paid for the services provided, even when they provide them weeks late/strike.

The most hypocrital aspect of it all: it seems like what’s going on here is “I’m gonna strike to show the school my worth!.... but I’m going to stop striking on April 30 because I have my own obligations to attend to that will be affecting my grades/GPA, never mind the fact that *I am screwing over students in my charge by not teaching them things/grading their stuff*”......

So, besides being hypocrites, what’s wrong TAs? Not committed to your cause? ARE YOU COMMITTED? Show the school how committed you are then. Strike through May 16th. SHOW THE SCHOOL YOUR WORTH!

Or don’t. And just have the hypocritical / lackluster striking attempt be giggled at.

Grade our stuff, or actually strike. Can’t have your cake and eat it too! (Oh the irony)",0,,False,dy2bt2p,False,False,1524842884.0,2018-04-27 10:28:04

I didn’t do biochemistry, but know several people that did.

All along, it's been very unclear what your issue is, and if your emails to your financial aid office are anything like your comments, financial aid probably isn't clear on what your difficulty is either.

I will note that I'm pretty sure that SSOL doesn't include if Columbia has received your FAFSA, or, at least, I've never seen a button. Usually I get an email from the feds that my FAFSA has been processed, and it's automatically delivered to Columbia (assuming you included Columbia on your FAFSA form). 

However, if your program is anything like mine, FAFSA was due with the application so maybe that's the delay, if you filed it late.

Unfortunately this is the level of communication that exists so I'm going to have to deal with it.   


I haven't received a fed email (only one upon submitting my FAFSA in late April) but it also wasn't do until the time of application. I remember seeing some deadline for my program as Aug 1st, which seems a little late. I know that GSAS is probably not at the top of the list if they are dealing with situating PhDs, so I'd like to think that's causing the delay.

shocked @ GSAS/MA program,sail_the_silver_sea,"If your FAFSA hasn't been processed by the federal government, then Columbia wouldn't have it yet. So that could be your whole issue. Mine has typically taken a couple days pre-pandemic, but I imagine processing takes longer. But you should probably check up on that if you still haven't gotten the email saying your FAFSA was processed successfully. Not with Columbia, with the feds.

I applied before the scholarships deadline myself, so FAFSA was due with application. I also don't know what other forms you're talking about as the only ones I've had to fill out are FAFSA and PLUS loans (which you say you can't get to). The FAFSA is federal and Columbia isn't going to be able to help you fill that out. You need to talk to someone at the federal government for that. And I think if you applied after the scholarships deadline, all the aid you will get is loans, or at least that's how my school does it.

And yes, tuition isn't due until after classes have started, so the deadlines to apply for PLUS loans are pretty late. I do not know the refund date if you need cash now, but you could probably google for that information. I worked prior so I was able to front the money if necessary but otherwise I might have looked more on those dates.

You should keep trying the financial aid office, absolutely, and hopefully you'll get through. I'm in a different Columbia school, but I had answers within a day from my financial aid office pre-pandemic. My guess is that they're swamped at the moment, and might have fewer employees. Or maybe the GSAS financial aid office is generally bad. No idea.

In the meantime, I would also reread all the information you have so far. What deadline is Aug 1? (rhetorical, no need to answer.) What are your other deadlines? Peruse the information available to you, because oftentimes there's a lot more than you think. If you have not read through every page on this [site](https://sfs.columbia.edu/fin-aid), do so now.

What’s the best way to prepare for Advanced Programming?,VimmyBoi,"I took AP this semester as a junior transfer and I think I can help. While I did end up getting a P as my grade, I did do pretty well in the course overall. Here are my tips:

- Be detail oriented. Really scrutinize on how stuff works. When you’re learning C, you’ll overwhelmed and confused. This is normal. When you do get overwhelmed, take a break. When you get confused, slowly work through what you don’t understand. Don’t hesitate to ask Jae or the TAs for help. They will help you.

- Work on assignments incrementally. Once you learn to use Git, get into the habit of coding, testing, and committing frequently. What this means is the that you’ll want to break down your assignment into tasks(the lab spec already does this quite a a lot) and then work on a single task at a time. Code the task thoroughly and test it, and once the code behaves as you’d expect, commit it. Rinse and repeat throughout the lab.

- Read K&R early. Jae assigns this book as one of the books for this class. If you read the book(or even the assigned chapters) before class, you’ll know exactly what questions to ask when Jae goes over the topic. You’ll end up saving a lot of valuable time when you do this.

- Don’t compare yourself with others. You’ll inevitably come across people who seem like they’ve been coding from the womb. These people may make you feel like an imposter. Do not compare yourself with these people, or anyone else really. Just focus on your learning and don’t be afraid to ask dumb questions. You’ll thank yourself later.

- Integrity is everything. The one thing that Jae respects the most in his students is integrity. He really appreciates students who struggle but choose not to cheat. In fact, he commends people for not giving up. You don’t need to be a coding whiz to win his respect, you need to be a person of integrity. On the flip side, if you cheat you’ll get caught really fast and will get punished. He is unforgiving when it comes to cheating. Just don’t cheat.

- Stay gracious. Remember that Jae and the TAs want you to succeed. These people will work as hard as they can to help you. If you stay gracious, you’ll be a lot less frustrated and will enjoy the class so much more.

- Don’t forget to pat yourself on the back. This class will be hard. With every lab, you’d have become a better programmer. Don’t forget to appreciate your own ability to learn and work hard.

Those are my tips, friend. With that said, welcome to the family. Go Lions!",2,,False,frlb3aq,False,False,1590273108.0,2020-05-23 17:31:48

How did you actually meet people here?,CandidColumbia,"Let's get the basics out of the way. 

Welcome to undergrad and welcome to Columbia. You will now realize life is unfair and you will (hopefully) find comfort in this, no matter how hurtful the truth is. Some kids got in here through connections, some kids got in here cause they busted their asses off in high school, some kids through sports scholarships, some tipped in through affirmative action, and finally some kids got in here cause they're rich. None of this can be refuted, and anyone who tries to do so is either in denial, utterly oblivious to reality, or pretty stupid. But that's fine. Undergrad is a system. Everyone is here cause they're supposed to fulfill a role the university is looking for (musician, athlete, balancing male to female ratio, race, ethnicity, etc.). So never let imposter syndrome creep up on you, cause in that case everyone here should be having imposter syndrome.

Most kids are upper middle class and can afford to fuck around, and for those who come from lower socioeconomic background, get ready to make social sacrifices and work harder to keep grades up and prepare for anything post-undergrad related. Nobody is equal. Everyone is different. It's just the cards that we've been dealt in life, we were born this way. Can't be controlled, so just be happy with it!

You will eventually notice a general classism that exists on campus. People will stick to their own clubs and groups, hierarchies will form, people may decide not to talk to you just because of the way you talk, look, dress, act, who you're friends with, etc. And people WILL talk to you for those reasons as well.

Finally, as a prerequisite, realize that 99% of this student population is afraid to be alone. Cause we were just kids. And that's fine and understandable. You're either coming from a different country, a different state, or you're just experiencing a culture shock, or you've never been around moderately rich upper middle class kids. You're not expected to fully grow into an adult just yet, so you'll struggle coming to terms with all this. But that's cool. You'll eventually get to it if you keep being introspective and analytical.

All this was necessary to emphasize cause, once you come to terms with the above, you can now come to terms with the rest of the advice I'm about to give you.

The groups you'll form each semester, some will come and some will go. Some will turn into enemies (try to avoid this as much as possible) and some will turn into friends that you'll have for the entirety of your undergrad experience. Occasionally you'll see that one clique which sticks together forever throughout your years here, but ignore that. Chances are most kids here are not experiencing that hold-hands-and-sing-kumbaya friendship circle, or they just stick with it cause they don't have any option of people to hang out with.

You (probably) spent your 18 years of living focused on getting accepted into ANY ivy league institution (or maybe Columbia really was your dream school and you chose it for that). You will go through tough times making REAL friends here and there, but you're not alone. Plenty are still doing that. Throw all that baby shit out the window--we're young adults now, and alot of Columbia students try to generate value and happiness for themselves by getting flat out drunk all the time, partying it out hardcore, joining clubs, etc. They probably never got the chance to do so in high school cause they were too busy studying and, if they did it alot, chances are that kid probably ended up here with a bit of $$$ helping him/her out. All of this is done because of the desire for self validation, for approval, for some form of value to keep the person going.

NSOP will be the time for hook ups, loose friend groups which will eventually dissipate, etc. That's the reality. You'll come to a point questioning your place here, questioning your social skills. But that's good. Cause you're going to slowly realize, and become comfortable with the idea that, in life you just have yourself.

Alot of us are scared by this. We spent all our lives having our parents around us, living by an education system that surrounded us with kids our age who we could compare ourselves to. It's normal! But you'll start realizing, shit, I gotta prep myself for a job post undergrad! Responsibility will hit you hard. And this is where the beauty shines through.

Responsibility is what keeps everyone going. It's what gives us purpose. It's what gives us the drive to better ourselves.

Everyone is afraid to be alone. And once you realize this, you'll suddenly feel a burst of enlightenment and learn how to prioritize things like building yourself, loving yourself, instead of fixing yourself for other people. But be warned, it takes a great deal of emotional intelligence to manifest such confidence and strength. 

Undergrad is a phase. You'll soon see yourself changing your academic interests. Some will find that thing in life that they'll always want to do. Others will graduate terrified of the real world hitting them in the face. Just be the person that works on yourself. Get up, get breakfast yourself, no shame in that. I do it all the time. Go to the gym. Pick up a hobby. If you are curious about something, Google it and read articles about it. Come to reddit posts like this. 

Some people will try to go for frat life or sorority life as a method of social acceptance. I personally always found that kinda pathetic (unless, obviously, you NEED to build a network cause you're trying to make bank as an IB in GSachs post undergrad or smth like that) but honestly I always found the whole ""brothers for life"" idea bullshit. They'll grow up, leave undergrad, get a job and focus on themselves, go on their own path, just like the rest of us here. They just don't bother to think about that and want to live in their own fantasy. Jokes on them, all the frat bros and sorority sisters will eventually wake up.

If you EVER feel alone (you will at some point, I can assure you) please don't build that pride to yourself thinking ""Oh God, I'd never sit alone, I'm no loser"". Adults do it all the time cause they don't give a shit to make a friend. They have themselves, their own life and (quite possibly) their own families/gf/bf. Forget about those that judge you for that. The fact of the matter is they are even MORE insecure because they can't imagine being alone themselves.

The genuine friends you'll make will come. You'll sit in the library one day, ask the person next to you for a pencil and remember they're in one of your classes. You'll probably hit it off with something casual, see each other on campus, and then eventually bond over a mutual emotional experience.

Or you'll see a cute guy/girl, start talking to them, and eventually start dating.

Or you'll see someone at a party.

Or you'll see someone at an event on campus, or in class.

Social opportunities will always surround you here, so don't worry about putting yourself out there too much. The right people will come. And remember everyone has a road in life. Occasionally the roads will intersect, occasionally they will diverge. Accept this and find beauty in this.

I wanna end off with a concept I'd like to teach you, the difference between being lonely and being alone. You will possibly experience both here. But don't feel lonely--you have yourself, you will build yourself, you will build your career, you will become stronger and more mature. And it's okay to be alone sometimes, to build your own beliefs and stick to them. Your concerns for a social life are trivial. Don't make this, or as a matter of fact ANYTHING in life, your concern just because other people your age are making it their concern. Don't be a sheep. Be your own shepherd. 

Take it from a junior. And FYI, I have an amazing friend that I met last year after seeing him at a party. We were literally dancing next to each other at previous parties and walking by one another, not realizing we existed. Then, boom, we met there, had the same econ class, studied together and stuck together till today. And we don't even have any similar classes or clubs. I chill with him whenever we got the time. We both make time when we can, cause we're adults now, and know it's up to us if we want to keep our friendships or allow them to dissipate.

It's all up to you.

Enjoy your experience here. And when it gets tough, remember there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Keeping it real here.",23,,False,eyupjgx,False,False,1567468622.0,2019-09-02 18:57:02
How did you actually meet people here?,shandy3,"Clubs and teams have been the best way for me! Seeing ppl regularly and working on fun stuff with them really helps build ties, and you'll probs meet someone who has the same major and take classes w them

A lot of clubs/teams don't require experience so def go out of your comfort zone and explore at the club fair. I joined a dance team even tho I have two left feet and met my best friends, now my suitemates. Great alumni network too

Just be careful of things that are too low commitment, those might just introduce you to ppl but not many enduring friendships. I joined the South Asian group and that's what happened for me, but parties are fun

How did you actually meet people here?,CandidColumbia,"For every action you do in life, you must question its motive. 

Why do you want to go to a party specifically? Do you think you'll meet a friend there? Meet someone that you'll have a long term, wholesome relationship with? Because to me, a party never was a conducive environment to talking, building rapport, and having deep meaningful conversations. Parties at EC or at the frat houses were about getting drunk, hooking up with your hot classmate or someone from out of town, and then making Columbia Crushes posts on Facebook about them ghosting you or about some cutie that you never had the confidence to go up to in person to talk to. You can try, sure, but you're more likely to create solid friendships if you meet someone outside a party. So be true to yourself and how you feel. Own up to your inner emotions and beliefs. 

That being said, let's get to the exciting alternative scenario. Do you want to go to a party because you're feelin' like you wanna get sexy? Awesome. Completely fine. No judgement. Just know how it happens and beware the potential consequences from it. 

If you go to a party alone around Columbia, and it's a small dorm party or something similar, big chance a bunch of questions will circulate round there as to who you are and why you're there in the first place. You can always use plausible deniability of course and say you do this all the time and you're just checking out the place, but let's be honest, nobody will buy it cause they know you're a freshman and you're just looking to talk to people. So if you wanna avoid the general a situation like this, best you ignore these.

If you're gonna go to a party alone, it better be PACKED, like the EC parties for Casa Latina or frat parties. Big crowd, very easy to get lost in there, nobody will question your presence cause there's just too many people to pay attention to who's in a group with who.

But friend groups are also important to consider for big parties! But before we get into that...

I can only speak on behalf of straight people and the traditional male/female dynamic (socially dominant man, socially submissive woman), cause well, that's who I am and those ladies are who I'm attracted to. Purposefully highlighting this cause I know there are people who don't share the same opinion as me for how they want their relationship dynamic to play out. And to them I say, hey, I respect that. So if I respect your dynamic, you should respect mine.

So here's a quick rundown for people who want to follow a similar gender role dynamic as me. Dudes, in big parties like that it probably won't matter too much to be in a group, but somebody might question you and, realistically, you could just say something like you have a couple friends who are in the bathroom. And plus, you're a dominant guy, you don't really need other guys to look after you. Only excuse for hanging out in a group with other guys is cause you're too unconfident to go by yourself, or maybe you're gonna get drunk and need a lookout. 

Ladies, please be careful and look after yourselves. Real men know you dress up to look pretty for us. But know there are bad men out there who are thirsty and will do anything to get their hands on you. Stick to your friend group (girls, preferably). It will intimidate the hell out of these asshole men who try to take something you never gave them consent for. Also, if you ain't attracted to him, screw his feelings. Make it known and shut him down if he isn't doing his job of making you feel good. And men, learn how to grow a pair of balls and build attraction in the first place. If you're accepting the dominant role, it's YOUR responsibility to know the right moves for her to like you and see you as something as more than just a friend.

People will disagree with me here, but I'm just keeping it real. Both men and women should keep in mind, when you're bringing alcohol into the mix here, and you hook up, and people regret, it is EACH of your faults if you allow yourself to get into that position. I believe both people should have a similar level of emotional intelligence to look after themselves in that way. A bit of alc is fine. But know your limits and don't cross them. Guys, Columbia is big on this and will label you as a predator if the girl happens to regret that hookup. And ladies, yeah, you got the law on your side there and can retract consent, but why ruin a dude's image just cause you made a stupid mistake and didn't know how to take care of yourself? Both people got responsibility. Don't abuse the system just for your own image. It's selfish and low-value.

Only way you will ever hear of a party is by word of mouth my friend. So if you really want a party, start talking to people to figure out where to go. You don't have to go with them, but just keep everything above in mind. And please be responsible, girl or boy, and look after yourself.

Have fun.",4,,False,eyy5zis,False,False,1567572582.0,2019-09-03 23:49:42

Carmen is definitely the most social dorm because everyone lives in doubles, but it's important to bear in mind that the unrenovated Carmen floors look like prison blocks. If you don't want to live in a dorm where there's always parties or if you want to have a clean space then I wouldn't recommend Carmen. Furnald has undoubtedly the best amenities and is the cleanest, but it does have a tendency to be a little quiet. I disagree with the poster who said that no one talks to each other there. I lived in Furnald freshman year and it was definitely social, but there definitely wasn't any crazy parties and most people went to Carmen or EC if they wanted to party. John Jay is like Furnald, but your singles are pretty small and since the building is so large you'll have absurd waiting times for the elevator. This is offset by having private bathrooms. John Jay is also located in the same building as Medical Services, John Jay Dining Hall, and JJs, which might seem unimportant now, but trust me you will hate walking from Carmen to JJs to get a cheeseburger during finals in 20-degrees Fahrenheit. Hartley and Wallach are a blend between Carmen and John Jay and are suite style. Since Hartley and Wallach are LLC you'll also have the opportunity to make friends with upperclassmen. You also don't have to walk outside to reach John Jay Dining Hall, Medical Services, or JJs since they're connected to the John Jay building by tunnels. Hartley also has a ping pong table.

TBH everyone here is just going to tell you to live where they lived freshman year. I would recommend Furnald because I lived there and had an amazing experience.

Pros:

Having a single brings tons of advantages. Even if you know someone you wanna room w/, I'd recommend going for one.

If you want you can do anything from walking from your room to Butler and back or hanging in the lounge w/ppl from your floor every night.

Cons:

The rest of the dorms (besides maybe Carmen) have the same problems I think, but expect showers at every temperature besides the one you want, false fire alarms, and looong waits for the elevators.

“…Missing out on the college experience.”,frasier2122,"I grew up in the Midwest thinking that college would be like the typical big state school where everything in your world revolves around the university for four years. Columbia is not too much like that. This is both good an bad. It all comes down to two things: (1) doing undergrad in NYC, and (2) having peers who want to do school in NYC. 

Before I say any more, I should say that your experience is what you make of it, and I have no doubt that any one could find a completely different side of Columbia than I experienced. It's really impossible to accurately characterize a community of that size and diversity. 

But anyway. It's New York. There is no space. Almost everyone lives on campus, which means dorm rooms too small to fit a party in, or  best case slightly larger multi-unit suites that get hot and sweaty with a party going. This is not to criticize the housing at Columbia--it's fine--but to say that people tend to go out to bars / whatever nearby or downtown. This means that the social life can quickly be fragmented. New York is GREAT! Amazing city. So much fun to be had. It's cool to be doing a summer internship and be the guy who has tips for cool speakeasies around town. But when fellow interns have stories about their flop houses and the cases of beer they drink there, I can't help but wonder if their localized debauchery has some greater contribution to social cohesion compared to the bourgeoisie (I hate that I just used that word, but it fits) night life in New York. 

So then you have your classmates at Columbia. Incredibly smart, passionate, and honestly pretty friendly people. But it's an Ivy League school--many / most people are wealthy. It may even be less conspicuous at Columbia. But we're in New York, so it can actually be flexed. Everything is expensive in the city, so doing anything is expensive. It adds up fast if you're not careful. Some people don't think twice; others have to strategically avoid going out to even ""cheap"" bars too often. I just can't imagine this even being much of a concern elsewhere. You can't flex your wealth in Hanover, NH. 

Now none of these things are dealbreakers for me. But they aren't the kinds of things that most college students have to think about. Going to Columbia prepares you *very* well for being a New York yuppie, but you basically skip the step of being the alpha dog college student, big fish small pond, etc. First year, maybe. Everything is literally on campus, and it's harder to get into bars. 


Maybe it was just me. Idk. I loved Columbia, and I wouldn't have gone anywhere else. But I think ""missing out on the college experience"" isn't an unfair concern--even if it isn't 100% accurate. I might have been *happier* elsewhere, but Columbia was great. It was tough. It was challenging; draining; unique; overwhelming; cosmopolitan; etc. It is a microcosm of New York.

"Undergrads, how is the Columbia experience for you?",BrOiNpGs,"I was in your position when I got in ED too - everyone online (esp college confidential) seems to perpetuate the same cold, impersonal, and beurocratic  image of Columbia. Don't get me wrong, there are truths from the above picture, but I would say it's unfair and inaccurate for those to be defining qualities of Columbia. I started freshman year with the bar set super low from all my reading, and was wonderfully surprised with my experience.


First off the administration is kind of shitty, but not in a way that truly affects most students. For instance advising is not the best, but if you can understand how to read a list of required major courses you don't need to depend on an academic advisor. Another example people bring up is the extra security at the ""spring fling"" concert, but I really see that as a response to the student call for more protection against sexual assaults (a movement happening across all campuses).


As far as the social scene goes, I could not be more happy about the state of Columbia's scene, which is predominantly barhopping, mid-size hangouts, and the occasional apartment rager. I visited friends at Dartmouth and Yale when I was a sopho and was caught off guard by the whole ""join a frat to belong"" and ""hop from house to house"" thing - the general reliance on frats at most schools felt kiddy for lack of a better word. The scene at Columbia is much more akin to what the scene is like after graduation. I really do think the frathopping houseparty bit is fun, but I imagine it would tire much quicker than having the city to explore with a close group of friends. Also - there is an awesome, active Greek life on campus if you want it, but it is not the center of campus social life, which I love.


Classes are really professor dependent, but I've been pleased with the majority of my professors and been blown away by a handful. 


I honestly don't think the stress-culture from academics is THAT bad - when I found out we were ranked the most stressful school in the nation I actually laughed my ass off as a SEASboi. MIT, Caltech, Berkeley Engineering and Cornell Engineering are easily way more stressful than SEAS, and most of my engineering friends have way more work than my CC friends so it really doesn't add up imo at least wrt academics (though I can see how the city could be overwhelming/distracting esp. cause it's expensive AF).


Lastly and prolly most importantly, most students at Columbia really like it here. Columbia teaches you to be hypercritical of all aspects of your life, and I think that's evidenced by the prevalent dissent of the institution. Idk not to shit on Yale, but when I visited my friend there it felt weirdly culty, like no one had a single bad or even slightly negative thing to say about the school (even though the schools have a few of the same problems). While I think positivity is important, I much prefer the type of critical lens I've developed here because I feel like I can read between the lines of anything (if that makes sense). 

Hopefully I answered some of your questions and calmed some of your worries, but pls pm me if you've got any other questions or concerns.

Dating Culture at Columbia,Alienist23,"It's funny that you bring this up. I've actually been giving a huge amount of thought to it as well as I finish up my second year. I think your observation is correct. There appear to be to extremes. The hookup culture that tends to surround the fratty, sporty element of campus and then the intense pairing that takes place among some of the other groups. I'm not sure if I can even really address the situation in the hipster community here as it's one I have no understanding of.
 
This whole thing reminds me a lot of R vs. K strategists in zoology . There are those that dedicate a huge amount of energy to one particular romantic pursuit (K) and then those that go wide, so to speak, and just have as many shallow encounters as possible (R). I'm not sure if this is the case at all colleges, but it certainly seems to be a divide here. Perhaps most disheartening of all, is that a huge amount of the population does not see a romantic relationship as something that would be very rewarding. Rather, it's simply a subplot of their existence here. On the other hand there's the the opposite extreme of the chastity and marriage groups (Anscombe comes to mind) that appear unflinching in their refusal to participate at all. 

Long story short, you are not alone in your discontent with the dating culture. Long live dinner and movie. Apparently that has been replaced by ""I guess we should hang out some time or something,"" but so be it. 

Good luck. Apologies for the long response. 

Final note- I heard someone talking last year during NSOP about how he wanted to ask a girl out, but he did not want to take the emotional risk. I was reading the Iliad at the time and it reminded me immediately of that scene where Glaucus and Sarpeedon are talking about why they fight. Sarpeedon says something to the effect of, 'It is because we are going to die that we must fight. If we were to be immortal there'd be no need to win glory.' When applied to this guy's experience, it seems to suggest that it is not in spite of emotional risk, but BECAUSE of the emotional risk that one must put oneself out there. It is not simply a minimization of the romantic payoff that comes from casual relationships, it is a loss of emotional payoff from a lack of real investment.

What are some 'must take' classes at Columbia?,Eurynom0s,"Allan Blaer in the physics department is a really amazing professor. Amongst other things the guy puts really detailed notes on the board--he often doesn't even really require you to use a textbook for his classes--and even more amazingly, I'm pretty sure he's just winging it and that his only prep is making sure he remembers which topics to cover that day.

He's also really helpful during office hours. If you have the opportunity (and the prereqs) to take a class with him, I'd highly advise it. He's a busy guy so he's generally pretty set on when his office hours are, but he clearly enjoys teaching and wants to help people learn and is really helpful during his office hours. Even if you're not doing science, his math methods course would probably be useful to anyone in a field that requires calculus. Just don't try to schedule a class immediately after his, as he has a tendency to run over the listed class time.

On the other hand, I would advise not taking a class with Latha Venkataram (applied physics in SEAS) unless for some reason you absolutely have to. She's basically a living stereotype--in this case, of the science/engineering professor who thinks that teaching class is a waste of her precious research time and simply does not give a fuck about doing the teaching part of her job.

She's the kind of professor who doesn't notice (or quite possibly just doesn't care) that people aren't keeping up with her, gives homework problems which are completely useless in terms of getting you prepared for her tests, and then she curves to a C; I think the raw score average for the first test for the class I had with her was something like a 20--yes, out of 100.

Can someone practice behavioral interviews with me,Complex420," In 2020, most modern employers are using carefully-worded behavioral interview questions designed to expose your biggest weakness …   
Be prepared!  

What to do if you go for a job interview? 

* Turn off your phone. Do not leave it on vibrate mode. When you receive a call, this is still audible and that is very disturbing. 
* Introduce yourself nicely. Speak your name clearly and give a firm handshake. Make sure you don't squeeze! 
* Be polite. Make sure you are nice to everyone. Also against the receptionist and any other people you meet. When you come to work there, you don't want to have left a wrong impression. 
* Close the conversation nicely. Thank your conversation partners for their time and shake hands again when they leave. 
* Sit upright and try to relax your shoulders. This contributes to an active attitude. 
* Speak calmly and clearly. This makes you easier to understand and you come across more relaxed. Also provide some moments of rest when answering questions. This gives your conversation partners the time to process your reactions. 
* Make eye contact. Alternate eye contact if you have a conversation with several people. 
* Watch your body language. Try to have an open attitude. Avoid defensive body language, such as crossed arms and crossed legs. Make sure you don't do this accidentally, for example if you get a difficult question. Stay relaxed and professional. 

What not to do during a job interview?  

* Do not be late! This may sound very logical among the job interview tips, but it is important. If it happens that you are late, apologize and thank your conversation partners for waiting. Don't blame other people for your time constraints. 
* Do not sit first unless your conversation partner invites you to take a seat. 
* Avoid negative statements. Do not blame your previous employer and colleagues during your job interview. The employer will wonder whether you will also do this about your new job. 
* Don't be arrogant. It is fine to give tips for improvement, but do this in a positive way. Do not be negative about the work of someone else, because this may well be the work of your conversation partner. Make sure your tips are edifying. 
* Don't interrupt the other. Let your conversation partners finish their story and wait for your turn to answer. 
* Don't start tutoring. Address your conversation partners with ""you"", unless he or she indicates otherwise. 
* Don't chew gum! Fresh breath is important, but make sure the gum is out of your mouth before entering the building. Chewing gum comes across as very uninterested.

I think that was the hardest part -- yes, the grammar can be tricky but, at least for me, was a lot more straightforward. Most of the professors are great. However, the course does focus a lot more on reading/writing than speaking... you don't even touch casual speech until second year (I think) and it's not really emphasized at all. Finally, you should know that later in the sequence a large portion of the class becomes EALAC grad students who already usually speak Chinese, so it becomes harder to get good grades when compared to them. If you decide to continue past First-Year, it will be a big commitment (honestly, 5 credits is probably underestimating the workload), but if you have a deep interest/good reason to learn, and especially if you aren't worried about maintaining a 4.0 GPA, it's workable.",3,,False,g126hwj,False,False,1597111817.0,2020-08-10 21:10:17

Rigorous, and you have to be the type that enjoys/values that.

To a college.

In my experience, my peers have been incredibly supportive.  I've heard some stories.  It's a game you opt into.  I have no interest in it, so I haven't.

That said, I wouldn't call it competitive at all. My classmates and peers are definitely some of the most caring and helpful people I know and they got me through all 4 years. We had late night study/cookie baking sessions, we'd unwind and play Super Smash Bros, we shared old exams/job opportunities/textbooks with each other. We were all united by the stress. Even though all our classes were graded on a curve, everyone collaborated together and wanted each other to succeed.

As far as social life goes, it is what you make of it. I joined a few student dance orgs which gave me the opportunity to constantly meet new people, party, and enjoy NYC off-campus. It's a difficult balance though, because academics at Columbia are no joke. I was sort of a slacker in high school who got straight A's without studying, but Columbia was a different beast altogether. It is NOT chill at all. So if you're up for a challenge, then apply.

Brown vs Columbia CS?,Sushies,"Brown is a great school and strong in many fields, including fields related to CS like Applied Math. However, if you're very set on studying computer science, I'd encourage you to do some research as to the rankings of the two programs and more importantly the resources and majors they offer to their undergraduates. I think, from the popular majors, CS is probably the one with the most obvious choice between these schools academics-wise. Columbia undergraduate CS is quite strong, with many of the best STEM professors in any department here, has myriad opportunities for undergraduate theoretical and importantly, interdisciplinary, research, has a strong masters and PhD community that gives undergrads a choice among, for example, six (6!) Machine Learning classes each with a different focus, and has extremely good CS recruiting being in the city and being attached to significant startup culture.

That said, Columbia culture isn't for everyone. Columbia was the only college I got into so I didn't get a chance to consider anywhere else. Many times in my years here I've resented it. Don't underrate how beneficial being satisfied with your school can be: college is a grind and you won't leave the same person you started as, and having the constant passive benefit of not having to deal with depression/isolation is quite valuable. If you are worried about this, depending on your tentative career interests, it may well be worth it for you to attend a CS undergrad that offers fewer of the specific opportunities Columbia does in exchange for the academic freedom of Brown and having a happier undergraduate experience.",13,,1556209267.0,elr7r6c,False,False,1556208621.0,2019-04-25 11:10:21

I drifted over to computer engineering because I started to have doubts if I’d enjoy working long term with just CS, but as far as the classes go I think they do almost everything right.

A few things I can mention is that the overall class sizes (at least for the core CS classes) are quite big, so that could be a negative for some people if they’re expecting small class sizes right away. The introductory classes move quite fast here, but I think that would only be an issue if you come in with no programming experience which many people do anyways. There’s only been one core class that I’ve taken that I thought had a somewhat excessive amount of work (Advanced Programming in C) but you also probably learn the most in that class so I think it’s worth it. 

Aside from that I’ve really liked all my teachers so far and don’t have to much to complain about the program here. I don’t think there’s too much to worry about when it comes to CS here, but I think it would be a good idea to visit Columbia to see if you would enjoy being here for 4 years.

Is there anything about Columbia that most people (first-years specifically) don't know?,supdawwwwgwife,"This is fresh on my mind - 

1) follow through with your courses, even if you think you’re going to fail. I gave up on Calc I after failing my second midterm, convinced I was going to fail. I didn’t fail, but wish I had studied the material better so I would be better prepared for the next courses in the calc sequence. 

2) four credit courses usually require a discussion section, which day/time isn’t always established prior to the class starting, or even the add/drop period. For students with other commitments (jobs, commutes, children) this can be problematic. A class I was in finalized discussion sections after the add/drop period, I asked about it because I was very worried, I got a “there is a 99% chance” that the discussion sections wouldn’t change. Well they did. And I had a 5 hour commute to attend class for one hour.  If you consider the cost of childcare on top of it ... woof.

3) if you feel overwhelmed, a little (or a lot) depressed, or that you’re dumber than everyone around you, just know that a lot of students feel this way, not that it makes it better. Don’t push yourself too far or expect too much of yourself. Don’t be too proud. Don’t be afraid to talk about it if you’re feeling this way, don’t be afraid to seek help if you need it.

I agree, but I also want to add that it is okay to drop or even withdraw from courses if it's becoming so much that it's seriously impacting your other classes or mental health and wellbeing. I know some people who stuck out (or tried to stick out) a class that was just too much for them to handle at the moment. Sometimes it's okay to lighten the load if that's what you need.

Why aren’t the endowments for all three Columbia undergraduate schools merged?,lemonade2018,"While I'm pretty open minded about the topic, I think that just saying the separate endowments for the undergrad schools is due to elitism is an unfair argument. A fair amount students believe Columbia to have four not just three undergraduate schools, so following that logic, it would follow that the administration also views Barnard students as less worthy of the financial aid that the Columbia CC/SEAS students receive and that its an elitist argument not to merge endowments with Barnard as well. Also, I don't think the CC/SEAS undergraduate school divide is as stark as with the other schools. For example, I transferred from engineering to CC with almost no other changes to my overall experience at Columbia other than the requirements I had to complete and the amount of sleep I got on average. It was more like changing my major than transferring from one undergraduate school to another.

Despite all the above, I do believe that GS students should receive as fantastic as financial aid as I do. I come from a low income family, and there is no way I could have attended college without the financial aid I was given.

The acceptance rate for GS is way too high. They tell you a story about how GS is a newer school and has less donors attached than the other schools, but that record has been playing for the past several decades.

They pretty much admit anyone who might be able to handle the course load, and is willing to pay full sticker price. Sure the work in classroom is hard at Columbia, but there are thousands of people who didn't get into Columbia College who could have handled the coursework just as well. GS admits people with SAT scores from as low as 700 and the higher end is only around 1450, whereas that's usually the lower end for CC students who for the most part tend to score on the 99th percentile.

Many of the students that are admitted to GS feel inferior to the rest of the undergrads, have limited access to networking events, but are too afraid to say anything because they feel so fortunate to be able to attend Columbia. I guarantee all the CC admits had offers to equally prestigious schools, so it was more about the school wanting them then them ""needing"" the school.

The only way they are going to get a larger endowment is by become a selective school, and perhaps changing their name. Also they really need to stop buying ad's online, and dispersing literature to every community college.

GS students are in the same clubs, classes and university as other Columbia undergraduates. That they don’t live in GS/SEAS housing isn’t enough of a differentiator. An individual CC or SEAS student could have much more in common with a GS student than with one another, so that’s another blatant generalization. Age alone isn’t enough of a distinction, especially when there are GS students as young as 19. People have different college experiences.

I think that it’s wrong to impose an age limit on when it’s appropriate to help someone become a responsible member of society when there is a means to better help all needy parties. It’s great that Columbia decided to accommodate for non traditional students through creating GS, but that such a low percentage of their need is met is quite a hefty elephant in the room in a university that prides itself on embracing diversity and a exemplifying a social conscience.

It has led to a mob-like mentality and some disappointing behavior of certain activists aligned with the cause.

However, the writer of this article lacks a nuanced understanding of the Columbia's disciplinary process that led to the mattress carrying and related protests. This is only happening because due process wasn't followed in Columbia's past, and affected students are still on campus today. I'm confident that Columbia's policies have changed and will continue to change for the better.

In truth, this really doesn't have anything to do with ""men"" and ""masculinity"" at all. The writer fails to acknowledge that some of the alleged victims of sexual assault are actually male. It has everything to due with the way a flawed administration handled cases of alleged sexual assault.

An Ivy League Lynch Mob - A mattress witch hunt against “rape culture” says due process is just a “liberal paradigm” of justice,,"[In this article](http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/09/emma-sulkowicz-campus-sexual-assault-activism.html) Emma describes the specifics of the rape:

> she was sober except for a sip of gin-and-Sprite. He was buzzed and carrying a handle of vodka. While they were having consensual sex in her dorm room, she alleges that he suddenly pushed her legs against her chest, choked her, slapped her, and anally penetrated her as she struggled and clearly repeated “No.”

> Sulkowicz didn’t report the incident at first. But when two classmates told her that Paul had been abusive to them too—one who had been in a long-term relationship with him, the other alleging he groped her—she pressed charges with the administration.

> Paul denied the charges. If Sulkowicz is a fencer, she alleges he told the panel, her legs are the strongest part of her body, and he was only a lightweight rower—how could he have pinned her legs down? The anal sex was consensual, he said. 

Maybe it was rape, maybe it wasn't. But considering Paul would face life-long repercussions if expelled, and considering this wasn't a case of violent assault, I can see why the administration decided to err in his favor. If she probably wasn't going to suffer lifelong emotional repercussions from this ""rape"" then why should he suffer lifelong repercussions?

An Ivy League Lynch Mob - A mattress witch hunt against “rape culture” says due process is just a “liberal paradigm” of justice,silliestsloth,"Thank you! The issue is that Columbia did not follow THEIR OWN procedure. The Blue & White article that started it all lays it out *very* clearly. I'm an alumna and I assumed everyone on campus has been following this since the Blue & White article that made everything incredibly clear: Columbia did not follow its own handbook. The end! It's not a matter of whether or not Emma was raped!!! In fact, if she made the whole thing up, that would be just as bad, because Columbia BOTCHED things -- this is the kind of ineptitude that EVERYONE should be mad about. It's so frustrating to see everyone getting it twisted. The stupid ""well she should have just gone to the police way back when"" line is ridiculous: if Columbia promised to handle gender based misconduct, which they did because they have to because they receive Title IX funding, they MUST be a resource for people who experience sexual assault. When they encourage students to seek campus resources and then fail at providing that mediation, something has to change. What is there to quibble about?!

That said: I think that Emma's made it a bit difficult to follow. The focus on expelling JP rather than reopening the case, for example, struck me as surprising: yes, it definitely makes for a stronger artistic choice, but it's a little confusing politically as the overall point is that Columbia didn't follow its own procedure. Going for the expulsion of JP makes the entire mattress movement easier to paint as a ""witch hunt,"" which it isn't! (If it's a witch hunt of anything, it's one of Columbia.) Emma's involvement in the ""rapist list"" concerned me as well. And was Zoe Ridolfi-Starr involved with the rapist list as well?  While I can sympathize with Emma's involvement, I can't condone it, and in general, I can't say I love No Red Tape at all, but maybe that's just me. 

On another note, why aren't we talking about that girl who was raped by someone who admitted guilt and was kicked off campus but allowed to come back after his parents donated a lot of money...? Without diminishing Emma's experience (absolutely horrifying and immensely relatable -- the sort of thing many have sadly experienced at Columbia but not brought to the admins), the other woman's story is an even more damning story of the kind of corrupt system that Emma is protesting.

If it were sooooome people - perhaps I could let it go (though there are signs in the weight room reminding people to rerack the weights). For first time gym-goers, hopefully they will see the whimsical meme and take the advice.

But the sheer volume and consistency of unracked weights, quite frankly, is too damn high to be chopped up to ignorance. Putting toys back where they belong is a fundamental tenant of any child's education and/or proper home-training....and there are all of these oddly weight and dumbbell shaped racks at the periphery of the weight room - so I figured students at one of the world's most prestigious universities would be able to put that puzzle together.",1,,False,c8487mz,True,False,1359253427.0,2013-01-26 20:23:47
"Because it's not just etiquette, it's common courtesy ",BiologyTex,"The hours are fine - you can read up on them (here)[http://www.dodgefitnesscenter.com/?DB_OEM_ID=9600].  It does get mad busy at convenient times - the gym really hasn't expanded with the size of the university. I think part of this problem is that there are entire fitness rooms dedicated only to sports like rowing...the rowing rooms are empty most of the day, but are off-limits to us hard working, non-rowing students.  I cherish my Sunday evening workouts because its less crowded, and I can usually access the weights/equipment I want after 8:30 or 9 pm during the week.

The facilities themselves are okay - there are some problems in some areas of the 2nd floor weight room where the floor is dangerously un-level, which contributes to crowding in certain areas (you really need a flat surface for certain lifts).  Also the cramped quarters lead to some unsafe weight-racking/unracking since you have to squeeze past people lifting in order to get your dumbbells.

In short, the gym is in worse condition than any YMCA I've worked out in, and not at all what I expected out of a fancy-shmancy Ivy league facility.  For the amount of debt I'm going into to attend here, I'd like more weights, space, and accountability for people who don't wipe down machines and re-rack their shit.

Generally, taking surveys before in-depth courses is advisable, but doing the reverse still can be valuable. If you take AI with Dear (not sure about Ansaf again -- have heard less glowing things), the parts of the course you've covered already in ML will be duplicative / too basic (linear classifiers/perceptron, Bayes nets, HMMs), but the rest of the content will still be quite valuable.

Obviously, the social life is not what you'd get at a state school, because you will be doing a fuckton of reading and studying. But the people you will meet and bond with will be some of the most interesting people one could ever find in a few blocks' radius. There's a different kind of social life that comes with that: like deep discussions about a course with your classmate over coffee late at night in Butler Library, or just getting stoned with friends and learning their views on the world.


There's the traditional boozey social stuff too, but to a lesser degree than you'd get elsewhere. But you can go out to happy hours and do that kind of stuff for the rest of your life.

Regarding school sprit, does anyone really care about football or sporting events? It's something that I don't really care for, and I think not many people do at CU. Like at a big state school where there're like 100k people looking at a football game, not a lot of people go to our homecoming. I went once just to see what it was like. Meh...

Advice for incoming Electrical Engineering Student,ImNotHereToMakeBFFs,"I was an EE undergrad. The EE department is honestly so incredibly supportive. I have nothing but positive things to say, especially given the huge amount of encouragement and support I received through some tough personal times. The professors are friendly and engaging (highly recommend taking as many classes with Vallancourt and Kymissis as you can). The department has its own academic advising and career advising staff just for undergrads.

There are a lot of opportunities to do research and to find internships/jobs. I emailed a bunch of professors in my first week Freshman year and I quickly found one who was willing to bring me on his team, despite having less experience. In our senior year, we had companies like Boeing who came to directly to Columbia to give interviews and hire Columbia EE and MechE students full-time. Aside from that, the EE department has its own career advisor who has tons of research/job opportunities specifically for EE. Way more helpful than CCE (Center for Career Education) which is more generalized for all majors/the entire school.

In terms of lacking community/school spirit... I would agree. Columbia is definitely not a typical ""RAH RAH RAH Go Columbia!"" kind of school. Compared to graduates I've met from other schools (especially state schools or schools with impressive athletic teams), Columbia students don't have that same school pride.

That's not to say Columbia doesn't have community. It exists on a smaller scale imo. My EE class was a really tight-knit community. The opposite of cutthroat. We rooted for each other, helped each other, and spent a lot of time together. We helped each other with exam prep, shared textbooks, did problem sets together. We'd have late night study/dessert baking sessions, play tons of Super Smash Bros, go out in the city, and generally support one another. I never felt like it was cutthroat.

Having Second Thoughts About Committing to GS.... Am I Wrong?,BringBackPBCrisps,"I'll start with the issues of financial aid and transfer credit. These are the real drawbacks to GS and I think are entirely valid reasons for not wanting to go there. It's really expensive. You won't get much aid and the financial aid office will just suggest you take out student loans. I know there are a lot of scholarships out there but I never put a ton of effort into getting them. I had the GI bill and the cost was still outrageous. The transfer credit thing really sucks too. To go to GS you're just going to have to take more classes, but I don't think that's such a bad thing. Well, except for the money thing. 

Yeah the diploma is in English. I never cared but I understand why some people are hesitant to be outed as a lowly GSer by it. I dunno, the only people who will ever know the difference will be grads of the other schools, though I think the SEAS people get English diplomas too. It might be different for some, but I've seen my diploma like twice in the last 5 years. It just doesn't mean much. Columbia University will still be on your diploma and will still go on your resume.

Now for the good news, I think all the other stuff is misinformation. I remember looking up info on GS when I was considering going so I'm familiar with what you found. I was worried too. But fortunately it's all bullshit. The reality is that you will be unremarkable there. There are GS students (and older grad students) all over the place and we're just a part of campus. I kept to myself but I was never treated like anything other than another student. Kids from the other schools are too busy and stressed out to give a shit about you being a transfer. And on a more optimistic note, I just think they aren't that petty. I experienced absolutely no part of this idea that GS students are some sort of second class. I'm sure it exists to some extent, but whatever. For me it was always about the experience of being there, and nobody with a negative attitude can take that from you. 

On a personal note, my lifelong dream school (UCLA) offered me an amazing scholarship to transfer. I could have gone for practically nothing and I don't regret choosing GS in the slightest bit. Even if it did leave me broke. It was such a memorable two years. The city, the campus, the history, the classes, the brilliant people all over the place: it's hard to describe what a super fucking awesome experience it all is.",28,,1575694401.0,f9w2mak,False,False,1575685949.0,2019-12-06 20:32:29
Having Second Thoughts About Committing to GS.... Am I Wrong?,santajawn322,"I graduated from GS almost a decade ago. So, this is a perspective that you should take with a proverbial grain of salt. 

Personally, I'm really glad that I chose GS. At the time, I was a community college transfer student with a lot of options. Academically, I was a standout with a few interesting ""hooks"" (low-income background, political asylum seeker, etc.). I turned down a scholarship offer to attend any state school, in my home state, for free. And, when I got my acceptance to Columbia, I was on the wait-list at Brown and a few other top tier schools.

Why am I glad I chose GS and, more broadly, Columbia? In no particular order, here are a few things that come to mind:

1. Columbia ""sharpened my elbows"" and taught me to push my way through bureaucracies. Columbia isn't a single concept as much as a constellation of schools and institutions. Just to enroll and pay for classes, you need to butt heads with and seld-advocate to a number of those entities. I've found that, in my career, there are a lot similarities. Everything in the business world can be an uphill battle, with you against the machinery of a corporation, regulators, and other contingencies. I came to Columbia a pretty mild-mannered younger dude. I left with a ""fuck you, I'm gonna get mine"" kind of attitude. Now, when faced with obstacles, I have an endurance that lots of others lack.

2. The faculty was the shit. I made deep, genuine connections with a few professors and they became advocates/mentors for me. Two of them have passed away in the last year and, reflecting on what they've done for me, I am moved to tears. Not to say that there aren't good professors at other schools. But, we're talking about the best faculty, at the best school, in the best city, in the best country (sorry, not sorry) in the world. When these people go to bat for you, it fucking matters. 

3. The strength of weak ties. There's an old sociological study that articulated the strength of seemingly weak ties between people (e.g. two folks who were in the same frat at the same school, a generation apart) in western culture. To me, I've seen this hold true. I joined a frat while at Columbia and, almost weekly, I get an email or LinkedIn invite from a private equity guy, hedge fund manager, etc. We've never met. But, we're all alumni and bros and that's enough to start the conversation (hence the strength of a weak tie). To be fair, I've never tried to use this for my gain. But, candidly, I see people on TV and know that I'm one email away from a conversation with them, if I want to be. And, that's a powerful career lever to pull, should I need to. 

4. My career prospects were phenomenal. I'll admit it. I'm a straight up sell-out. I grew up poor and, once I realized that I could hang academically with pretty much anyone, I decided that I wanted to use my education go get me to a higher tax bracket. In a given week, the caliber of on campus employers gave me a heady rush. I did info sessions with the CIA, wall street banks, top tier law schools, and more. Ultimately, I went into investment management and I'll be damned if the Columbia brand/network didn't kick down some doors for me on my job hunt.

5. It was a super high-pressure, stressful, and competitive environment. At first, I complained about that to family and friends. But, fairly early on, I decided that I wanted to outperform my peers in just about everything I did. Columbia just sparked this fire in mt belly. It made me want to beat out my classmates at everything. And, for the most part, I was successful. To be amongst the highest achievers in a pathologically high-achieving environment is a confidence booster that lifts me up to this day. There are tough days in my career where I think back and go, ""Fuck this. I wrecked the curve in every class at Columbia, I can successfully find my way through this.""

6. In retrospect, there's been no differences between CC, SEAS, and GS in the real world. Recruiters looked at my coursework and grades, not which of the Columbia schools I attended. To this day, consulting and investment management recruiters use alumni to review transcripts. They know the profs, the courses, and the difficulty levels. Sure, they see which school you attended. But, Columbia does this awesome thing where your transcript shows what percentage of people in your course got an A. So, a CC alumnus will see your Economics class as an ""A 7%"" and they, I guarantee, won't say, ""Ewww, an old GSer!"" 

7. I was exposed to what real wealth is and what it can do. Again, I grew up broke as a joke. There's some real money at Columbia. It's different in that it's not ""old money"" like you see at Yale or Princeton (this is a huge over-generalization, I know). But, what's old money when you compare it to today's hedge fund and tech billionaires? I learned, first hand, that rules don't apply, if you have money. For example, Columbia says that you must apply to GS if you've had a year or more break in your education. Guess what! That's not true if you're really, really wealthy. To give one example, a casual acquaintance of mine was an alumna of L'Institut Le Rosey. The tuition at that place is something like $115,000 per year. Well, she was 21 when she started at CC. She took at two or three year break to do jack shit after her million dollar, Swiss boarding school education. And, admissions looked the other way when she applied to CC. There were a million examples of this that fired me up and made me realize that I, too, wanted to create real opportunities for me and my family one day. 

Okay, this shit went on much longer than I expected. There are more reasons. But, I'm genuinely glad I went the GS route. It's played out really nicely for me. If there's any caveat here, it's this: it's played out well because I've decided to align my life-track with traditional hierarchies, the traditional status quo, and traditional power structures. I'm happy to expand on that, if it's not evident in my above answers.

The university treats CC, SEAS, and GS as the same except with fin aid.

This is one of the many Columbia Facebook pages, and this was posted about two days ago. Take note that a majority who browse that page are CC and SEAS, and read the comments in that specific post. GS is loved every bit as much as CC or SEAS.   


The only real difference, as many have posted already, is the financial aid. School culture wise, GS is respected, partially due to the genuine diversity they present: they tend to have people from all sorts of demographics, and not just diversity in terms of race, but in all aspects. The stories you hear in GS will blow your mind away.   


But yes. Money. Columbia costs a lot of it. If there's anything to worry about in terms of going to this school, it's that, not GS's prestige or whatnot.

Having Second Thoughts About Committing to GS.... Am I Wrong?,tugboatp,"Well if you’re already in NYC and all of the schools you might attend are all in NYC then you wouldn’t have the traditional college experience anyway. Most NYC schools are commuter. I lived in NYC before GS and I was accepted into all of my schools. I chose Columbia because it’s the best hands down. When I applied I thought there was no way I would get in, but if I did I would accept and figure out how to pay later. 

The resources here are invaluable. The cost hits most of us hard, but I could be at any other school and still have to take out loans. Don’t let the internet (which is not the real world) force you into thinking/feeling something that simply isn’t real. It’s amazing here and no one even discusses the differences on campus. The words of like 50 people discussing such an insignificant topics vs the 1500+ actual GS students and the 8k undergrads altogether who have way more important things (like actual school work) to worry about shouldn’t even be a factor. 

No one cares but you if you care at all about being at GS. No one on the internet can make you feel better about this decision tbh. It’s all up to you. I personally wouldn’t change a thing about my decision. The doors opened, network and support from the world class faculty is more than enough for me to justify the cost and decision.

Having Second Thoughts About Committing to GS.... Am I Wrong?,TheMoreOne,"Sounds like you're just nervous, because I am too, with similar cold feet.  It affords some life changing opportunities in and out of the school, and sounds like you're aware of that.  I have family very familiar with ivy and other universities, and they are all adamant that I should go to Columbia as the opportunities are just that much better.

GS is a separate school because it's a separate type of student, and has its own faculty to accommodate them (us).  It's a big logistical factor.  Advisors I've talked to have admitted that GS students get more support than traditional students.

You say you've read about a lot of people being dissatisfied, but how many really?  I've seen maybe 5 people say something like that, which is statistically nothing.  It's really just a sentiment of people who are insecure.  Literally everyone at Columbia had some door they took to get in, and GS was yours.

Fun fact, Columbia's statistics *improved* once they included GS in them.  GS students are extremely motivated and capable.

The credit transfer thing is definitely a consideration though, and I was going to consider attending elsewhere if they would make me redo a year.  Strange they accepted so few.  They accepted 95% of mine, just not in any courses they don't offer (college algebra / trig).  Still though, I would accept adding a year onto my time in school for the opportunity.

Another thing to consider, is that even with the credits that ARE accepted, you have to have departments approve them to be applied to your major.  That could really set you back, but you need to talk to advisors about that.

You won't be able to take PE classes either.  Which I'm fucking bummed about because I wanted to learn to sword fight in fencing lol.

And money / aid is the biggest thing I think.  It's wildly expensive, and if you are taking that on as debt, I'd really suggest looking elsewhere.  I hope you choose GS though!",6,,1575687380.0,f9w3wda,False,False,1575686592.0,2019-12-06 20:43:12

Having Second Thoughts About Committing to GS.... Am I Wrong?,OrganicCauliflower9,"In terms of the ""GS stigma"", it kind of depends. I started Columbia in CC but transferred to GS due to having to take time off school/not being able to be a full-time student all semesters for medical reasons. Basically no one outside of Columbia really cares what school within the university you go to/went to, or that your diploma is in English. But there are less student life events for GS students compared to CC/SEAS student life and most GS students don't live in Columbia dorms (whereas almost all CC/SEAS students live in the dorms all 4 years) so it may be difficult for GS students to make CC/SEAS friends. But I also think that since GS students are generally a bit older than traditional college students they may not want to go to EC parties or Bacchanal or be part of other typical college shenanigans. It might take more effort as a GS student to feel fully integrated within Columbia student life but it's not really that difficult, and I know GS has its own student community. Perhaps it's comparable to going to Barnard in terms of social life (Barnard has their own community, but it's not hard for Barnard students to be integrated with CC/SEAS students if they make the effort).",1,,False,fefrgu3,False,False,1579063053.0,2020-01-14 22:37:33

* Initiate conversations with the people around you and get to know them. Never wait for people to talk to you. If they don’t reciprocate, don’t take it personally; maybe they’re just stressed out. 

* Be interested in who people are, where they come from, where they’re going, and what drives them. 

* People love to talk about themselves. Try to listen more than you talk.

* Smile and joke often. 

* Provide help to anyone whenever you can. Especially strangers. 

* Your best connections probably aren’t going to be someone you met at a networking conference, but rather a friend you’ve made in class, ECs, etc.

* Ask for advice. People love to give advice and it facilitates a bond.

* Similar to above, but never cold-call an alumni you don’t know and ask for a job. You have a better chance if you ask for advice instead. Ask for advice, get a job. Ask for a job, get advice.

What I eat on a typical day varies like most people. But it's much more expansive than undergrad where there was a point I lost weight because I didn't have money for a variety of food and I got tired of the cheap options.

I am not going to tell you where I live and I do have a roommate like I said in my first comment.

You're saying you lost weight from lack of means, and the columbia budget was above your spending then - that proves my point: columbia calculator assumes a bare minimum in terms of quality of life.

Life above 125 is also a different story. I never said I saw life with roommates as a hardship, you're just projecting your resentment on me. I'm merely implying that it's better to live alone, which I am sure most people agree about.

1000 sqft seems huge, Columbia subsidized an apartment that big for 2 students? that seems excessive. I paid $3200 for a one bedroom, wouldn't be more than 700 sqft total.

I think one should budget for $2.8k a month for rent only to live alone, maybe $2k with one roommate, assuming no help from the school.

I pointed out the quality of life you described because it's definitely out of the norm and does illustrate the point: if you're starving under their budget it means their budget is low.

And still, $50 a week on food is not eating like a king, i think this statement is misleading. Even in a poor country you'd eat very modestly with that amount, meaning a homemade sandwich for lunch and some toast and spread for dinner, at best.
I don't know what your 2 meals out per month are within that budget, I am assuming it's chipotle or 5guys - which if that's your treat once every 2 weeks than you're not the person Id ask about a normal budget around columbia.

In terms of things to see/do:

* Central Park is the defining outdoor space of NYC, especially the more southern parts.
* Great museums: american museum of natural history (west side closer to campus); Met museum (definitely one of the best art museums in the US); if you're into more modern art then MoMA and Whitney are both great. There are tons of other more out of the way museums, but it's probably worth going to those classics first. 
* Head downtown for street life, cafes, shopping, neighborhoods. Check out some classic NYC neighborhoods, west village, hip/grungy lower east side, SoHo for shopping, little italy for touristy stuff, and our actual Chinatown. 

In terms of food, there is sooo much in NYC. A few places near Columbia I love:

* Pisticci Italian
* Jin's Ramen

"Question to Columbia alumni: how many of your former classmates are ""unsuccessful""?",damnatio_memoriae,"Honestly, I don't really know anyone who I would consider ""unsuccessful.""  Maybe I don't have a strict enough definition of that word, but everyone I know has something going for them, whether that be a traditional ladder-climbing career, an academic one, or something less traditional.  I have friends who work at startups.  I have friends who became doctors or lawyers or finance professionals.  I have friends who started their own shops and food trucks.  I have friends who got PhDs and went into industry.  I have friends who got PhDs and became professors.  I have friends who work in marketing and publishing.  I have friends who make movies.  I have friends who are in the entertainment industry.

Not all of them are rich.  Not all of them are debt-free.  Not all of them are at the top.  But the ones who aren't rich are doing what makes them happy and are doing just fine at it.  And the ones who are rich and maybe don't love what they do are the people you'd probably call the most successful.

So I dunno what your definition is, or what kind of answer you're looking for, but I don't know anyone who's truly struggling or unhappy.  Even the people who were struggling and unhappy during college have managed to find themselves.  So I'd consider them all successful.

Columbia isn't the happiest of places, and it's not the easiest path to take, but in the end, it prepares you for ""the real world"" whether intentionally or as a byproduct of its own dysfunction.",12,,1510375530.0,dpnj6zt,False,False,1510374384.0,2017-11-10 22:26:24

being a Columbia student puts you in a community of bright, go getters.  And, you learn great habits from each other and from the demanding nature of the university and city.  Also, what a great place to meet your significant other.

Columbia Student Profile Wanted: We want to know your thoughts on Columbia University!,,"**Academics:** Columbia is tough, and there's very little attempt to hide that. Unless you intentionally seek out the odd easy class, you're likely to have a demanding workload, particularly if you've also chosen a demanding major. The Core Curriculum doesn't make life easier, though most people realize eventually that it's one of the best things about Columbia. 

As a world-class university, Columbia attracts top thinkers and doers to its ranks. This is both a plus and minus. Listening to a star give a lecture can be great, but it also means you don't have much access, and are interfacing mostly, if at all, with grad students who can be hit-or-miss. This also makes the big lecture class a cold and impersonal environment post-lecture. Don't try handing in those papers late!

**University Facilities:** In general, the school is hands-off about clubs, activities, and events. The onus is on you to carve out your own space and your make your own way, as in academic life, so in social/extracurricular. The only real campus-wide event is Bacchanal, and that seems to being sliding in quality anyway. 

Career services is there -- they host events and fairs, and can advise on applications and such, but I got the sense that as in all things Columbia, you can't rely on them. Form your own networks, make your own contacts. That's how most people get jobs/internships. 

**Student Life:** Dorms are small. Prepare yourself, particularly if you're coming from a spacious suburban home. Don't bring too much stuff, read up on your dorm and check out floor plans at wikicu. Past freshman year, group up -- more is better, generally -- for the best chances to land a good lottery number and a desirable living situation.

In freshman year, most social life revolves around campus and the dorms. You're too busy getting adjusted, studying and meeting people to really do much else. That, and you probably don't have a fake yet, so the city is kind of off-limits. Past freshman year, though, most people have defined their circle(s), their place on campus, and their place in the city.

As for food, avoid the meal plans. Most come out more expensive than decent meal from a Deli or the like. If you can cook, all the better, particularly if you've got a decent kitchen in your suite. Do the math, decide for yourself. 

**Weather and Location:** You're in New York City. If you love it when you get there, great. If you don't, don't worry. In a year you'll look back and wonder what happened to the smells and all the noise. Hint: it's there, you just don't notice as much. NYC is an amazing place, though the weather will make you wonder whose idea it was originally to settle in a place where the winters freeze you to your bones, and the summers are so hot and humid you need a machete to get through the thickness of it.

Columbia Student Profile Wanted: We want to know your thoughts on Columbia University!,,"Good point. One of the funny (perhaps not so much) things I noticed was that students don't really play dick-measuring games in terms of GPA/achievements, but are always glad to one-up one another in terms of misery. If you meet an acquaintance outside of Butler Library and tell them you have five papers, three midterms and two presentations due this week, they'll probably tell you how many more they have and how many days of sleep it has cost them so far this week.

It's unhealthy, and unfortunately we've seen a spate of suicides, but I think it has as much to do with the culture of stress as with unhealthy expectations on the part of the student body. Most people who matriculate to Columbia come from schools where they were *the shit*. Coming to Columbia  can be a blow to the ego. It's important to realize that not having 4.0 and the hot internship isn't the end of the world, and that just being there you've already won the lotto.

These students-and you for that matter--are missing the point of the core curriculum.  As said earlier, it's foundational literature that for better or worse shaped the world we live in.  The core ties you to the last 100 classes at Columbia and demands dissection of the works from an ever changing viewpoint of the modern student.  That's the point.  If you're offended by the callous or commonplace acceptance of sexual assault in the works, then discuss it.  We did.  That's the point.  Don't demand the professor bend the material to your sensitivities and warn you of things that may offend you.  The world will offend you.  Be prepared for it.

Again, PTSD is serious and requires treatment.  I've witnessed panic attacks, but not one where the victim could sit through a small group discussion unnoticed.  I suspect what we have here are a few students more interested in drawing attention to themselves than purposefully seeking assistance and understanding from their professor.",8,,False,cr8gew4,False,False,1431568448.0,2015-05-13 20:54:08
Classical Mythology Too Triggering for Columbia Students,silliestsloth,"I meant that it was distracting for the person who had it -- of course it's a serious mental health condition. I did not mean to diminish the severity of the condition, but rather point out that it provides serious academic blocks in addition to mental distress. 

I agree that the op-ed was likely written in bad faith. I've followed a bunch of things Tracey has written this year at the very least (I don't know the other writers; I'm an alumn) and I don't agree with her on basically anything. That said, I don't think it's fair to ask the theoretical person having a panic attack to ""discuss it."" The op-ed was ridiculous, but allowing students to excuse themselves from class if they're having a panic attack shouldn't be an issue. Based on the anecdote the writers provided, however, I doubt that's what happened. I struggle with anxiety and I've left classes because of panic on multiple occasions and it's been no big deal. I told professors at CU/BC about my condition and they were nothing but understanding. I have to assume the person described in the op-ed was rather sanctimonious about their trigger warning request and did so after the fact; instead of simply removing themselves from the situation, they made it an issue about everybody and the professor fucking up, which I can see why the professor took issue with. 

I just take issue with the idea that trigger warnings *in general* are bullshit, which is unfortunately what a lot of the dialogue about this has become. That's what I was trying to argue here. And I don't think that someone misses the point of the Core by missing one lecture or one part of a lecture because they have PTSD. I think it would be fantastic if professors gave content warnings if they're going to talk in-depth about rape or graphic violence, but they didn't do that, they talked about the language, so I don't see how the professor could have expected that to be triggering. 

I agree overall that the world is offensive but this isn't about being offended, it's about not having a flashback, and I think it's fair to let professors know that there are things they can be doing to make classrooms more welcoming to those with mental health issues. In principle, I see this kind of request (if it were worded as a request, not a ridiculous hyperbolic demand) as akin to asking the professor to use a different color marker because you have poor eyesight -- the professor doesn't have to acknowledge it, but it's good feedback for making a more accessible classroom. However, the professor probably put things on the syllabus (I was at BC so idk, but I'd assume so...) so there's really no excuse for the girl being surprised, and for anyone to be surprised in these situations. Ultimately, students are paying for college, and the goal of college is to learn, so it's reasonable for students to ask for accommodations to make the most of their learning experience. (Can you tell I was really into Disability Services?)

Finally, panic attacks and flashbacks aren't the same thing. And panic attacks can be entirely internal -- I have personally experienced dissociative panic that isn't very flashy. PTSD, obviously, requires treatment, and I resent the use of ""being triggered"" as short-hand for what it really means. If we're going to talk about triggers, let's talk about PTSD. When the op-ed writers talk about trigger warnings and ""getting triggered"" and leave out flashbacks and actual PTSD, they do those who struggle a serious disservice.

Classical Mythology Too Triggering for Columbia Students,PM_YOUR_WALLPAPER,"> it's about not having a flashback

Classical Mythology Too Triggering for Columbia Students,silliestsloth,"Did you read what I wrote? I'm not talking about reading material, I'm talking about discussion (which can become heated and get out of the control of the professor), and I have at no point argued that professors shouldn't teach sensitive or ""triggering"" material. I'm saying that students should have an opportunity to leave classes when necessary, which I'm quite certain they do. 

Professors should be -- and as far as I know, *are* -- aware that there's some material that may require introduction or advance notice for students with PTSD, anxiety, or other mental health issues. I think it's reasonable to hope your professor will to their best to make an accommodating classroom. But the argument here is ultimately pretty silly: professors *do* a good job with this (so the op-ed was pretty stupid...) and on the other side, no one is arguing that books should be banned because they're triggering.

If the students writing the op-ed were complaining about a discussion that was off the syllabus, I'd have more sympathy for them, but they had fair notice to excuse themselves from class. There's no reason they should have been surprised by the discussion. *That said,* the people who have reacted by saying that all trigger warnings are bullshit are being ridiculous as well. That's not fair, either, because PTSD is a serious condition. Ultimately, both sides are being idiots: these people *did* get a trigger warning and they still freaked out but that doesn't mean that trigger warnings are stupid in general or that there's some boogeyman trying to ruin the Columbia Core.

Do you think Columbia will reach a decision re: class opening by early/mid-July?,normiep,"What happens in terms of classes - no matter what gets announced - is going to depend on what's happening on the ground in NYC in September.  We could declare loudly that everything is in person tomorrow and come September a resurgence could change everything in a heartbeat.  Even if everything goes perfectly, the number of people in a room at the same time is going to be limited by distancing guidelines, so I would expect some sort of hybrid/online component unless you're in only very small classes.

Research is going to start ramping up soon (subject to NYC hitting phase two reopening).  How much of your program is actually course work in the first semester/year?  In my department, PhD students are at most taking a couple of classes a term - often just comping out of the classes by taking exams at the end of the term and focus most of their time on research from the start.  So even if classes are remote, most of the time they spend could still be productive/pretty much the same as what it would have been (assuming research is still active).

So much of this depends on what your program actually looks like and on factors that our completely out of anyone's control that the best thing is probably to reach out to your specific school or department and your program chair and see what they suggest.  Some departments admit phd students from the start with a particular research advisor - if you fall into that category try reaching out to your future advisor if the department is not responsive.

How do GS international students finance their studies,Sealas,"Yeah 40k is insane. Is that solely a grant or a combination of work study, loans, and whatever your GS scholarship is? 

Most of the time aid packages include a fair amount of market-competitive loans, where the money “given” isn’t great. If you got 40k in grants/free money - go you! 

You’re going to have to get private loans unless you have the money to pay for school. As someone already mentioned, having a US co-signer is going to be extremely important because the loans you get on your own will be predatory. I know internationals students with double digit interest rates at 6 figures balances - :( . Keep in mind, just like financial aid, you can negotiate your loans and rates. Shop around, get some offers (lie if you have to about offers - I did and got my rate reduced by 2.5%). Also, reach out to Daniel Rodriguez- he’s the head of financial aid and the most useful/knowledge person in that office. He has the authority and knowledge to give you the most help. Plus, he’s cool and doesn't hate his job yet.

As far as if GS is “worth it” - for most people it’s not. From a financial standpoint I don’t believe a fair amount of GS students will be better off with the debt they incur than going to a state school. With you being international, your state school options aren’t much better because the variance in tuition rates - INT students pay 2x-5x more for state schools. 

I would do some research on the return of investment of Columbia, compared to other schools you’re considering. In certain fields, the increase of lifetime earnings from Columbia doesn’t offset the total cost of attendance - hence why I said above that people are worse off. There are other things to consider, but it is a very difficult question for everyone that can’t pay for it outright. It took me 3 months, at least 30-40 hours of research, and a few therapist visits to work out if it was “worth it” beyond just the cost.",4,,False,fpra9s3,False,False,1588848018.0,2020-05-07 05:40:18

And thank you so much about your advice on getting loans! Being a Dual B.A student, I will only have to study at Columbia for 2 years, which decreases the amount of loans I have to take a lot. But I agree that I don’t know yet whether the degree will pay off, as I’m not entering some majors like STEM or CS. I also have the option to petition to “drop” the Columbia degree and continue fulfilling my first degree if the finance gets bad, because the university I’m studying at under the Dual B.A is significantly cheaper than Columbia (we’re talking about a cost that equals or even less than some community college in the States).

How do GS international students finance their studies,Sealas,"40k from GS is .01% status. I've been in the program part time for two years and I've never heard of anything close to that - a friend got 30k, but I'm pretty certain that included federal loans. Considering what I know about GS giving ""generous"" scholarships compared to its average, you must have one hell of a story.

Of course about the financial advice! I am studying Financial Economics after all. For those with limited to no understanding of consumer/client leverage to bargain in generally accepted prices and terms - like loans - if I can give one person the perspective they can negotiate that; it gives so much while costing me the 5-10 minutes to write a response.

Funny thing about STEM or CS degrees - prestige returns less on these degrees. CS especially. You said you're international so I'm not sure if you know about all the coding academies (maybe it's a US thing?) or stories about self taught programmers that get their first job at Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc and instantly start making 6 figures - it's because they don't  even ""need"" degrees. It helps, but if anything wins the negligible Community College tuition and little to no debt v. Prestigious University with 5-6 digits of debt and higher initial earnings debate - it's CS.

Similar skilled people in STEM and CS, with different tiers of education end up converging to similar earnings mid career. I had this really fascinating study that researched prestige v affordable in a bunch of fields, but I deleted the bookmark two weeks ago and can't find it :(. If you search google scholar for ""Is a prestigious university worth it?"" with a bit of luck you'll find something with numbers to see what you could expect on average. Seeing average earnings for low, medium, prestigious educations at entry, mid-career, late-career was invaluable.

Part of why I chose GS is even though it was a massive investment, the core alone would give me exposure to culture that I never had. Being in NYC and taking Art Humanities to then be able to go to The Metropolitan Museum after class and see a piece in person, or when I took Music Hum and the class watched madrigal performances, got serenaded by a Gregorian Choir, then went to the Metropolitan Opera, and even Contemporary Civilization (which I've been saving) to read the ideas which manifested Western society - where else could I get that? Columbia expanded my horizons and self-image. 

Most importantly, I know myself well enough to get my money's worth. Whether GS was initially ""worth it"" didn't matter in that I would make it worth it because there's nothing I hate more than buyer's remorse. I don't think I would network as much as I do at Columbia, develop my work ethic, and explore lectures and seminars at the Columbia graduate schools if it wasn't for the need to ""get my money's worth"". I use my museum pass, buy subsidized tickets, go to any event I find tolerable (especially if it has food), and utilize every resource I can.

Those are the main reasons I picked Columbia over University of Washington. You don't have to agree with any of them, but hopefully it expands or contracts your uncertainty to decide.",3,,False,fptogtz,False,False,1588895110.0,2020-05-07 18:45:10

* I got a call at my office after a lunchtime workout. It was another member who accused me of taking her grooming products. Not only had I not taken her cheap shit, what was the front desk doing giving my number to a complete stranger? I complained.
* I froze my membership for the summer but was not supposed to be charged an administrative fee. I was charged anyway and no number of calls and emails changed the situation.
* There was a hideous, fat and not fit woman trainer who kept trying to pressure me into taking sessions with her despite my clear lack of interest.
* After Super Storm Sandy, I called and called to see if the gym was open as it was not in an area that was hit badly by the storm. The phone kept ringing and they didn't even put on a message. When I finally walked down there, it was closed.
* The equipment is squeezed in so tight I've banged my limbs against the walls.

Getting ""bad"" grades may not be that big a deal, especially your first semester. The concern to me is that you were surprised. That suggests you're not well calibrated to what your professors are expecting. Fixing that should help you figure out what's expected, and then once you know what's expected you can nail it and improve that GPA.  Can you give some examples of where (specific subjects and parts, like a lithum paper or physics final exam?) you did worse than you expected, and why you think that might be? 

For humanities classes, hopefully your professor provided useful feedback. Read through it. Are you not engaging deeply enough? Not providing original research or thoughts? When the semester restarts, you might email the professors asking about coming to office hours to go over what you did, and could have done better.

(Advice) First Semester grades,cscu090619,"I transferred as an incoming junior so take this for what it's worth. 

I had a 4.0 at my previous college, but I finished my first semester here with a 3.42.  I was pretty discouraged and it was a humbling experience.  But the adversity pushed me to find ways to improve.  I finished my second semester with a 3.67.  A little better, but still not happy.  I finished this semester with a 3.74.  Grrr.  I'm never the smartest guy in the room. I think I'm pretty average here. But my grades keep improving so I think my approach works.  

I think learning and getting a good grade go hand in hand (obviously) but I also think getting a good grade is more about strategy. The first thing you have to do is read the syllabus and understand the grading rubric.  What are the weights for exams and problem sets?  What are the cutoffs?  Is it curved?  If so, try to score at least one standard deviation above the average for every assignment and exam.  Does participation and attendance matter?  Allocate more time to difficult classes and utilize OHs.  Read and understand the material.  Try to not rush through assignments and readings just to get them done.  Try to actually understand everything that you do and read.  This will carry over during test time and make cramming for exams much easier.  For each week of the semester, write a one page summary that covers all the major topics. At the end of the semester, you will have a \~16 page study guide for final exam.",3,,False,fdgt6du,False,False,1578407685.0,2020-01-07 08:34:45
(Advice) First Semester grades,mrgiblette,"Hey--I'm currently a Junior studying physics. I also had a first semester that I wasn't super thrilled with, and like jewperman\_OG said, it was sort of a necessary evil for me to get my shit together. Here are some things that I try to do which have kind of worked for me and may or may not work for you depending on your major, how you learn, etc.:

When I study, I usually try to at least skim the textbook before lecture so that I'm not completely lost. Then at some point after lecture (honestly, usually a week later or even more), I try to go back and re-read the sections/chapters covered and take notes on the material. For problem sets, always making sure to start them early, even if it's just looking at the problems because you may see something in lecture or unconsciously think of a way to approach a problem. Same thing for exams--being organized is key. Always keep subconsciously thinking of what your professor could ask on an exam.

It's kind of a cycle of skimming, annotating, and practicing over and over again until exams. A lot of the stuff you are going to learn (at any major) is going to be pretty tough, so seeing it multiple times with more added context each time is very important to really understand the material. Some people can go without taking notes and just re-read stuff, but I like the mechanical aspect of taking notes because it makes you think a bit more as you re-explain the material to yourself.

I wouldn't call this super effective though--annotating in particular takes a load of time depending how you approach it, and it's something I've been trying to improve on for a long time now. It might suit you though, so give it a shot! Practice while at home!

But as someone else said, don't sweat your first semester grades too much (this is normal). You were adapting to a whole new environment as well as trying to deal with college classes (which are pretty hard frankly). And after all, you have a lot of time to bring your grades up. Just make sure to reflect on how you can improve for next semester and use the motivation you have to study hard and kill it next semester!

- Ethnobotany with Michael Balick if it’s still offered. Balick is a director at the NYBG but more interested in shrooms and ayahuasca. You do fruit tastings and learn how to make interesting salads out of Asian vegetables. Course also somehow counts for the science requirement.

Life advice,vivelacorndog,"I was in a cohort of ~15 students, ranging in age from 22-40. 2 are now physicians, roughly 10 of us are working in public health, and a small handful transitioned to other sectors. Of those working in public health, approximately half chose the higher paying consultant route after graduating. The other half work for the federal government, research institutions, or in global development (me). Private sector consultants start with higher pay - closer to 80k a year, and public sector employees start closer to 60k. There are opportunities to move up across the board, and your starting pay also depends upon your experience. Overall, I would say that my relatively diverse cohort seems very satisfied personally and professionally. I had very little relevant public health experience when I graduated, and my first salary (before I had officially graduated) was just over 59k. Over the past five years, my salary has increased to roughly 70k. I’m right at the point that I could stay where I am and begin earning quite a lot more, but I’m moving to a more clinical role that will require that I go back to school. I certainly am not wealthy, but I’m comfortable and able to handle my bills very readily each month. I’ve travelled to more than 15 countries in my current role, and I was able to buy a house two years ago. And I had to fund my entire program (beyond scholarships) with federal student loans - subsidized and unsubsidized. With 10yr fed loan forgiveness (which I admit, is messy right now) and income based repayment, I feel really comfortable with where I am. I chose the best school that I got accepted to, and therefore the most expensive, and it was worth it. The professional counseling, networking, and mentor ship, and name recognition that comes with an MPH from a well-ranked institution is unbeatable and what you’re paying more for.

I really want to join the program but am afraid that GS actually isn't as good as the rest of the school is,FishFrogHybrid,"I’m skeptical of this article. Having different UW/CC classes or signing into dorms was literally a non issue. I would never consider it humiliating but I don’t discount the author’s experience. In my opinion, it all really depends on your age.  If you’re a 30+ GS student, your experience will be markedly different than the CC/SEAS students, but wouldn’t you want it to be? 

This article also doesn’t mention that GS students can join school athletic teams and fraternities/sororities. In my opinion, “not being able to sign yourself into undergrad dorms” is a non issue.  Those are social things.  Regarding academics, I still interacted regularly with the brilliant student body and faculty, and built lasting relationships.  Most of these students are smart (duh!), and in my experience were intelligent enough to appreciate a non traditional student. If they judged then that’s immaturity and their loss. 

I came to GS at 26. I joined a fraternity and made some fantastic friends that I’m still very close with. It all depends on you.

I also met some of the most interesting people in GS. I met refugees, professional ballerinas, veterans of foreign militaries, and former start up entrepreneurs who decided to just go back to school and get a degree. 

Your experience at Columbia will depend on you and your attitude. Nyc is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, and I am so grateful I made to decision to attend Columbia and live there in my 20s (even if it was my late 20s).  

No one asked or cared that I was in GS. No one. If they did, they were certainly great actors because they never treated me less because of it.

- GS students are excepted and wanted at Columbia. I have GS students in all of my clubs and even my frat.

Your social life at GS is what you make it. I have plenty of CC and SEAS friends from classes and clubs. I’ve known GS students who don’t socialize at all with GS’ers and only have SEAS friends. It really is what you make it.

Perhaps you could ask them about their experience.

I'm a freshman in CC and I know someone who just came to Columbia through the City University program quite well. I'd say that person is having a great time here academically and socially.

What the article gets right is that people in your immediate vicinity are often people who are in GS. Therefore, you might need to actively seek out events to bond with CC/SEAS kids. But that's not too difficult, given the amount of events on campus. The person I know has a lot of CC friends, I wouldn't worry too much if you put in some effort.

Regarding core classes, being in a class of only GSers is not necessarily a bad thing. Lit Hum and CC for example are mostly discussion based. Therefore, students’ experiences and perspectives matter a lot. My professor teaches one CC section and one GS section. She often shares comments given by people in the GS section with us because they have a more mature perspective.

Ultimately, if you want to challenge yourself and study in a different academic setting and country, I don't think you should worry too much and just go for it! Good luck!",3,,False,edipzfq,False,False,1546904544.0,2019-01-07 17:42:24

I took UW in my first semester and having all GS students made it a lot more comfortable and eased the transition. 

I participated in the SEE-U program in Jordan and spend 6 weeks with a group of students that was about 50% GS and everyone got along great and many of us are still friends  3 years later. 

As others have mentioned, GS doesn’t offer the same forced socialization as other schools but if it’s important to you you should have no problem. I’m a bit older than you but have two friends in GS who enrolled at 21 and 20 and have no issues making friends with GS and non-GS students alike.

It might not be a problem per se, but there’s no good reason for it either.

Also I think “humiliating” might be extreme, but not being able to swipe into dorms is really annoying, and honestly it does feel exclusionary. It very much shows the way that some people continue to view GS and GS students, and like the split CC/LitHum sections, there’s no good reason for it. Lots of GS students are younger and make friends with CC/SEAS students and this discourages inter-school relationship building as well as creates a hassle for everyone involved. 

Giving GS students swipe access and shared CC/LitHum sections shouldn’t be a problem—so why is it? 


Otherwise I agree. I’ve never felt belittled or judged by other students for being in GS, and tbh most people never even realized I was unless I explicitly told them.

How cutthroat is Columbia really?,teh_blackest_of_men,"Columbia isn't a cut throat place, by and large (though presumably this could vary by major/department? I can say that I never encountered any of that). It does, however, treat you like an adult, which can be really startling for someone who isn't prepared for it. 

What do I mean by that exactly? No one is going to hold your hand. You're going to be expected to make friends with people, do your coursework, and find ways to entertain yourself on your own. It isn't the kind of school where everyone goes to the big game every weekend to get trashed on light beer. If that is the college experience you are looking for, look elsewhere. Columbia actually believes in diversity in the sense of pluralism, rather than diversity in the sense of people who look different but all do the same stuff. 

Yes, Columbia is ""cliquey"" in the sense that you actually have to put in effort to meet friends and make plans. You live in NYC. People aren't going to just go strike up conversations with everyone they see walking around. If you want to be friends with people, you have to actually have something in common with them and also make an effort to hang out. If you are shy or not used to meeting a lot of new people this can be stressful and take a while, and before you sort of ""find your niche"" it can feel like there is no community etc. But there are a lot of things to do, all the time, which cater to every possible interest, both on campus and off. If you don't have the initiative to make plans with people to do things of mutual interest, you are going to be sad and lonely when everyone else is doing fun things all over NYC and you're sitting on campus alone with the people who never leave the library. 

In response to the links you posted: that was just not my experience at all. Yeah, you have to do your fucking work, but it isn't that hard and it doesn't take that much of your time. As evidence of this, I present the fact that EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW MUCH STRESS THEY ARE UNDER TOOK THE TIME TO WRITE A MAGAZINE PIECE OR REDDIT THREAD BITCHING ABOUT HOW LITTLE TIME THEY HAVE! One wonders how, if everyone is so stressed out about classes, they have so much free time for extracurricular writing and dicking around on the internet... To the ""everyone goes into finance"" thing, there is an easy solution: don't go into finance if you don't want to. It's a pretty ridiculous attitude that people who work for Goldman are ""selling out""; you have no idea why they are choosing to work where they work, or what they see their future career path to be, and it is an act of stunning hubris to assume that everyone has to share your sense of what is or is not an appropriate or desirable career choice. 

Finally, you probably shouldn't choose what college to go to based on a joke facebook page...",16,,False,dgpf0rl,False,False,1493076486.0,2017-04-24 18:28:06
How cutthroat is Columbia really?,binglytums,"OP didn't specify, so I'm going to assume you're asking about undergrad. I should preface this by saying that I'm a transfer student at GS (came here from another Ivy after taking a few years off from school), so take into account that my own prior experiences/perspective are very atypical.

“Cutthroat and cliquey” are a little extreme, but it's not too far off the mark. The campus culture is very school-oriented - I’d agree with what someone else said about CU’s academic difficulty as defining your time here. Making friends isn’t that hard, but actually making the time to see each other is. The combination of super urban location/super heavy schoolwork mean that you really have to make a strong effort to actually hang out with your friends at Columbia (this is probably slightly better if you live in a dorm, which I never did.) There were plenty of douchebags I couldn’t be bothered with, but it was also super hard to find time to hang out with all the cool people I did meet here because everyone is so busy and overworked. At some point, even chillest, nicest people will end up being selfish with their time here.
 
For someone choosing between schools with comparable academic reputations, you should really only come to Columbia if:

1) the prestige is worth the $250K+ price tag
2) academics are the most important factor and you’re totally fine with skipping out on the ‘traditional’ undergrad experience you’d have at most US schools 
3) you have to attend your school in NY because of professional or family reasons

The last reason mostly applies to GS students, so assuming you’re choosing between CC/SEAS/Barnard, choose carefully. School spirit is low, there’s not much of a sense of community, people are usually stressed and never shut up about school, on-campus outlets for fun/socializing are weak (Greek life here is a joke) and nobody cares about Columbia sports, at all. (I honestly feel super bad for the athletes here, but that’s another topic.) 

As a point of comparison, I went to Dartmouth for 3 years before transferring to Columbia (probably the two most different schools imaginable.) The academics are about equally challenging in terms of difficulty, but there are big tradeoffs. Compared to Dartmouth, Columbia assigns way more tests/schoolwork, requires much more time spent in class, and has much larger class sizes (way more TAs, fewer opportunities for 1-on-1 interaction with profs.) Two of the biggest drawbacks to coming here are the lack of physical space and the sheer amount of TIME you actually have to spend on schoolwork. The latter can really limit you from fully exploring the city, hanging out with friends, reading/learning for leisure, or doing a lot of the things that define “college"" in most people’s minds - you just have too much damn work. There’s some cool student groups, but any group that is actually large/well-funded enough to actually do anything usually ends up with people competing over meaningless leadership roles to pad their resumes (assistant VP of communications for a 10-person organization, or something like that.)

I did a summer program in HS at Brown but can’t really speak to it otherwise, I do know that the alums have a reputation for being super enthusiastic about the school (much like Dartmouth alums.) Columbia is something like #34 in alumni giving rate among US universities, which tells you something about how much most CU alums enjoyed spending undergrad here.

tl; dr: Columbia has amazing academic opportunities, but it’s really stressful and requires an absurd amount of time spent on schoolwork, being located in Manhattan has a lot of inherent compromises, and the administration gives 0 shits about the undergrad experience. If you want to balance academics with a fun undergrad experience, go to Brown instead.

I'll be 30 soon. Columbia was the worst decision of my life. The vast majority of the people who graduated +/-2 years of me have pretty shit lives too. For some of them, ""going to an Ivy League"" school is the only thing going for them.

>It's a pretty ridiculous attitude that people who work for Goldman are ""selling out""; you have no idea why they are choosing to work where they work, or what they see their future career path to be, and it is an act of stunning hubris to assume that everyone has to share your sense of what is or is not an appropriate or desirable career choice.

That's fair, and I apologize if I was coming off as judgemental in my original post. I admit my wording could have been better. Yet, the real question I was trying to get across is whether or not there is a competitive environment to snatch up internships at institutions like Goldman Sachs.

How cutthroat is Columbia really?,teh_blackest_of_men,"> whether or not there is a competitive environment to snatch up internships at institutions like Goldman Sachs.

Probably less competitive to get a finance job at Columbia than elsewhere, given how hard banks recruit on campus. 

> I also question the motives of someone who is simply interested in getting an internship with Goldman Sachs because they are interested in the prestige of the position, rather than due to the fact that they possess a genuine interest in finance.

So as a corollary to the ""it's actually pretty easy to get a finance job"" point, I think that it's probably less that some people are interested in the ""prestige"" of a banking job than that they actually just don't really know what they want to do with their lives, and kind of fall into finance/consulting because of how easy it is to get a job there from Columbia. Firms recruit really hard, and so if you don't have a clear idea of what you want to do with your life, and a bunch of people in nice suits buy you fancy dinners and throw cocktail parties and offer this nice clear career path (and promise to throw substantial sums of money at you) it can be very tempting to jump on that bandwagon because of anxiety about the future. 

BUT, just because you start doing something without a huge passion for it doesn't mean that it isn't actually the right career path for you (and likewise just because you think you are really interested in something in college doesn't mean that you will like doing it as a career). In fact, the point of internships is to get to try out different things and see if you like them, so I don't see how that's an inherent problem

Plus, prestige is actually a pretty good reason to take a first job in your career, since you are probably going to want to move around at least some (maybe a lot) over the course of your career, and starting in a ""prestigious"" first job out of college can make it easier to move to the next opportunity that you are interested in, but which maybe has no entry level position for you. 

> I'm simply trying to understand what the culture at Columbia is like

I'm not in finance, but a lot of my friends are, and I don't think that choosing that career path influenced the culture they were a part of or their time at Columbia (other than that they didn't do fuck-all work senior year because they already had job offers lined up which was a good thing for the curve in their classes and a bad thing for the study habits of their non-finance friends).

Data is Beautiful: Columbia Undergrads Edition,the_mattress_guy,"tl;dr: So I generated this by generating a dataset with all the directory information on Columbia undergrads. The data is limited to undergrads in CC, SEAS, and GS. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Is Columbia University the place it thinks it is?
 Columbia University prides itself as being a super diverse place based on its students and the interests of those students. The [admissions website](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/learn/studentlife/diversity) itself brags about how many different types of minorities and majors are at Columbia. We all know that a lot of the admissions stuff is hot air but there had to be some truth to it (or we believed there to be) or else some of us may not be here right now.  

## Names

Race is a touchy subject so I'll refrain from making value judgements and hopefully discussion here can remain civil. Columbia is pretty Asian, anyone whose been here for a while knows this. Its cool to have a **naive** data way of showing this. While I did not post a grad student data set I did take a look and the Graduate Studies programs here are very much biased toward Asian names, with not even an Anglo name showing up in the top 20 first or last names. This definitely feeds into the idea that certain Graduate Programs(many in SEAS) are simply cash cows for the University taking advantage of Asian Internationals. 

## Majors
Unsurprisingly the most commonddepartment is Undeclared. Given that CC underclassmen mostly haven't declared yet that is pretty understandable. What is interesting about the department breakdown is how pre professional Columbia really is. From this data, **Columbia isn't really a liberal arts school anymore**. The top CC majors are Econ, Poli Sci, Bio, and Pysch which mostly funnel into either Professional Grad School ( Law, Business, Medicine) or into Finance/Consulting. It doesn't seem that the majority of people come here to discuss ways of thought as much as they do to get technical career oriented skills. Additionally its very possible that the distribution of majors and the distribution race are not independent. I'd be very interested to know if there is a culture divide at the University centered around race and materializing in major and residence hall choices.

## Thoughts
After looking through the data a bit, its very noticeable how diverse Columbia **isn't**. There are a couple of follow up things I want to explore including:

* Names by Department (Are certain majors attracting certain groups) 
* The relationship between majors and dorms (Do more engineers live in Wallach)

Data is Beautiful: Columbia Undergrads Edition,the_mattress_guy,"That's actually a misconception. The US, at least for general anglo population (non eastern europeans), doesn't have as much of a diversity of surnames as you'd think. Additionally, the way the dataset is compiled, Asian International students with American first names won't have that show up in this dataset. Their American First names are actually configured differently by Columbia if they are not their legal first name. 

Additionally filter the dataset down to a very humanities based major such as film. You'll see the distribution of last names total skew away from Asian. So while its not great at showing exactly how much of a population is of one group, its a good proxy for figuring out if a group is being represented in any significant way.

Toast - Amsterdam and 122nd(?).  More of a restaurant, but good beers on tap.

The Heights - Broadway btwn 111&112.  Great rooftop in the summer time.  Can get pretty crowded on the weekend.  

1020 Bar - Amsterdam and 110th.  Dive bar, they have 3$ beers for happy hour, which is always nice as a grad student.  They also do trivia, I think on Tuesdays.


Further down / UWS - a lot of good bars a short ride downtown on the 1 train.

The Dead Poet - Amsterdam btwn 81/82 - Great irish pub.  One of my favorite low key bars in the city.  And if you like guinness join their Guinness club.

On Amsterdam btwn 79-82 are a lot of collegeish bars that have beer pong (jakes dilemma) or the like, if that's your scene.  They're easy to spot.

So happy to say that I'll be coming to Columbia next year!,HalfAlienRobot,"1) A lot of people say to not bring your own printer, but I've had times when I've found that it would be very useful to have a printer in my room, especially since CU printers are more often broken than functioning. Unfortunately, my room's so small, I'm not sure where I'd put a printer. Which leads to point 2. (Oh and by the way, they say you have 100 printer pages a week, but if you do ctrl-alt-backspace, you can get around that with the school printers)

2) Try to get into Furnald. Ignore what they say about it being an antisocial dorm-- it isn't true at all. I applied for the LLC as my first choice (mostly due to feeling safer in gender neutral bathrooms), but I started regretting it as winter approached. It's really cold here and I wish I had heaters that I could adjust myself, like my Furnaldian friend has. Oh, and his single is 50 sq feet larger than mine and has soundproof walls.

[edit: Although, I might be applying for the LLC next year-- there aren't that many great choices for sophomore housing, I heard, and I kind of just want to treat my freshmen better than our upperclassmen treated us in our suite...]

3) Make friends during NSOP-- don't just ask for name, major, where they're from, what dorm they're in, and then forget them. Exchange numbers and make an effort to meet up with people again!

4) Don't get super caught up in joining all the groups. But at the same time, join a couple and go to some events-- CU has a lot to offer, so take advantage of it!",2,,1355689927.0,c7hk5qf,False,False,1355689685.0,2012-12-16 14:28:05

Anxiety for Lit Hum and University Writing,siestaa,"I’m also a slow reader, but I found that reading sparknotes/cliffnotes and THEN reading as much of the actual book as possible (I mostly skimmed, making notes here and there about passages I found interesting). LitHum is also a class where you get out of it as much as you put in; if you don’t do all of the reading, you can still do well in the class. 

I also found that UW was a lot of work, yes, but it’s all broken up into parts, so it wasn’t ever an overwhelming amount of work at one time. The readings for UW were also interesting and not too dense, and the papers you write are largely of topics of your own choosing; it should be interesting to you, so hopefully writing a larger quantity isn’t as horrible. 

For your remaining classes, I would honestly not recommend taking all three classes together in the same semester. Data structures is somewhat a lot of work (as in time put in), and calc III problem sets are also a huge time sink. Principles of a Econ (especially if you’re taking it with Gulati) requires a lot of textbook reading; when I took it, the lectures weren’t really directly relevant to the material that we were tested on - it was more just applications of those things.

If you are exceptionally comfortable with writing, however, getting rid of the Lit requirement while taking UW shouldn’t be a burden. On the other hand, Calc III and Principles of Eco go tremendously well together. I’m unsure if combining those two with the heavy writing/reading course load would be a healthy way to begin your academic journey at Columbia. My personal suggestion: drop one of the humanities and look for an elective instead since you appear to be slanting towards the STEM track.

Anxiety for Lit Hum and University Writing,impossibly-green,"as with any other discipline, you get better with more practice. a skill you have to learn in academia as a whole is the fine art of skimming. reading over a large volume of text to get the general gist, not necessarily every little detail. it might be a struggle at first, but you will learn how to quickly digest a lot of information. 

as for UW, it too will teach you a lot. if you are a bad writer, it will make you much much better. yes, the drafts get annoying, but they genuinely make you write much more thoughtfully. and honestly, the way the drafts are set up makes it impossible to procrastinate an essay to the night before, since you have to turn in a new draft basically every two weeks or so.

for both classes, the profs know you are a freshman. they stagger the work in the class to help you adjust as much as possible. of all the humanities class you can take, these two are the most guided and, in that way, easy. you always know exactly what your prof wants, and they will tell you exactly how to do it.

Advanced Programming uses a mathematical way of thinking on the tests, but again there is no actual math required and people who are ""bad at math"" do fine in the class.

My point is, you can be a very good software engineer without knowing any math. I don't know if that's what you want to do, but it is a very easy way to make money.

If you're a freshman, and you don't have any experience, and a lab is willing to have you do free research, should you turn it down?

Likewise, if you're a freshman with 0 experience, and a small consulting shop is willing to have you come onboard and play excel / do work that will most likely get thrown away because you suck, should you turn it down?

If you can financially afford to do this stuff, having these experiences on your resume will help a lot when doing internship hunting down the road. Further, these people who you work for will be MUCH more willing to mentor you / help connect you to places that are hiring bc they will feel indebted to you.

I'm not saying it's RIGHT that places offer these internships, and I'm not saying they are all as good as paid opportunities, but they're absolutely better than nothing IMO.

Tip: Don't do an unpaid internship,sometimeInJune,"Unpaid internships enable those who (1) don’t have experience and (2) can afford to not spend that time scraping in extra cash / are willing and able to take in extra student loans to cover costs. So yeah, it exacerbates privilege. I never said it was morally right. 

My point is this. The world is unfair. If you’re a rich kid with no experience, and some family friend invites you to do relevant, good ass resume material work for them for free, you take it.  If you would go hungry because you need to spend that extra time working at an irrelevant job, then you can’t take it, and that sucks. But like this extends to so many other things in life. Attending Columbia— that’s a mark of privilege. We don’t shut it down just because it furthers the divide between privileged and unprivileged.


And OP IS wrong because he’s making a blanket statement that students shouldn’t do unpaid internships (which is just plain wrong advice that ignores nuances).",2,,1595694992.0,fz7gw23,False,False,1595693730.0,2020-07-25 11:15:30

School difficulty,sometimeInJune,"GSer here.


Preface: I don’t mean to be a dick. I’m just going to be straight with you.


For context: I worked my ass off at a solid university and pulled a 3.9+ before transferring here. I was a TA there for two CS courses and was among the top students in many courses. Here, I study a good amount while holding a part-time job and I’m a little over a 3.7 (CS major). I’m definitely not the best student anymore, but I think my GPA is above CS average.


Yes, there is a strong Ivy League culture here. It’s an amazing university, and kids work insanely hard. Most of the undergrads at Columbia sold their souls to get here through an insane amount of work and studying. You need to understand this and you need to get up to speed with them as soon as possible. Columbia kids are brilliant and are overachievers. When you graduate, employers will assume you are as well. So, become that. Become brilliant in your favorite subject and work hard.


If you want the degree and a good gpa (and a good job + good law school acceptance letter), you will have to learn how to work. You’re currently the Ebenezer Scrooge of studying, and you’re going to have to have a miraculous change or you will drown. 


Columbia will not slow down for you, or any GSer, and that’s what makes it so great. When you graduate, you will feel like you earned it, and you will feel like a true Columbia student.


As for advice: limit yourself to fun only one night a week until you get acclimated. Start your first semester with 12 credits / 4 classes to get a feel for the rigor. Initially plan to spend 2 hours of studying for every 1 hour of class. Be very meticulous about Professor and course selection. Always, always, always ask for advice from your peers, especially GSers— we’re your family, and we’re here to help. Start networking and doing career prep now. If your LinkedIn sucks, you’re behind the game already. If you haven’t touched any interview prep book or website, you’re behind the game already. (Edit: forgot you’re gunning for law school)


Hopefully this wasn’t too harsh. Let me know if you have any follow up questions.


Important note I forgot to mention: No law school and no employer will grant you access just because you have a Columbia degree. Law School is primarily based off of test scores and gpa (undergrad school only matters when scores meet a certain threshold), whereas job is based off of a myriad of factors. A 3.7 from, say, Texas A&M will fair better for law school than a 3.3 from Columbia given similar test scores.",39,,1563821623.0,eugdwz5,False,False,1563805901.0,2019-07-22 09:31:41
School difficulty,frasier2122,"I was in a similar situation coming into Columbia undergrad with no study skills. Whereas previously I could blow off studying, cram, and rely on luck and pure skill to get through exams, at Columbia the pace of the classes and the expected level of quality for the work was much higher than I was used to. And that was a good thing. I wouldn't say that I turned into a model student or anything, but I definitely had to learn to keep track of what I'm responsible for knowing throughout the semester, and plan ahead appropriately to fully grasp those subjects. 


So, depending on your major, you can make the jump to undergrad study skill fairly easily. But the law school (went to CLS) will rock your world if you aren't up to pace for it. I'm talking diligent full time job kind of hours throughout the semester, and then basically a month of non-stop, you don't see your friends or family, 24/7 study mode for finals. ESPECIALLY during your first year. 


Also note: if you take *any* pride in your intelligence, then you have to realize that in life, but especially in the academic environment, intelligence will only get you so far. If other people have the dedication and are willing to spend the time to study, do multiple drafts of essays, etc., then they WILL beat you out. Even if they are obviously less intelligent. So do the damn work. Commit to getting a 4.0 your first semester just to see what it takes. Then adjust your dedication / expectations as you see fit.",7,,False,eugkxj8,False,False,1563809920.0,2019-07-22 10:38:40

Without looking up anything that's been released, I'm going to guess....

That it's going to be the same as every other year.

* 99% chance that the headliner will be a black male rapper 
* 100% chance that one of the supporting acts will be a black female R&B artist
* The other supporting act could be either another black female R&B artist, an obscure white rapper, or a no-name EDM artist. 
* 150% chance that the Columbia University bureaucratic machine is going to make the whole experience a pain in the ass

What do we know about Bacchanal?,CUspac3cowboy,"I think the lack of diversity can be attributed to (1) lack of funding and (2) lack of community input. 

The reason why all the artists are hip-hop and R&B is probably because that's what the Bacchanal committee listens to. The Bacchanal committee seems like this insular group that just invites people that *they* want to bring. I think the CCSC sent one email last fall with a poll asking people who they wanted to invite, but it wasn't in the subject line of the email. It was just sneakily tagged on at the end of the email, and I can imagine that 95+% of people didn't see that poll. 

And the selection process isn't transparent at all. How do they select these people? Do they even listen to their community poll results? I doubt it, because every year they announce the line-up and nobody ever fucking knows any of the performers.

What are the advantages of being a C. P. Davis Scholar? (Debating Harvard vs. Columbia?),theirishcampfire,"These are my two cents on the topic. First of all congratulations on being admitted to 2 very prestigious programs. 

It sounds like you’re an international student, and I can tell you from the get go that Harvard might have a better (albeit undeserved) reputation abroad.

Both places will offer you an amazing education, no doubt. The feel of the school, or rather the campus, could be different though. Columbia is at the heart of one of the most interesting places where to live, New York. Harvard, being in Cambridge, slightly outside Boston, does have a bit of a suburban feeling to it.
At Columbia, you’re surrounded by buildings... tall ones. Having moved here from Florida, it becomes a bit of a drag after a few weeks. Colleagues of mine who moved from Chicago are just fine with that.

Another thing to consider (Extremely relevant if you’re gearing yourself towards a career in humanities or social sciences, slightly irrelevant for engineering and sciences), is The intellectual genealogy you’re stepping in. Columbia does have a bit more of a leftist orientation compared to conservative Harvard. ",6,,1522384887.0,dwibzlv,False,False,1522374142.0,2018-03-29 20:42:22

I can put you in touch with a CP Davis scholar if you want.  PM me.

TL;DR: It's a scholarship and you have access to the ""columbia scholar's program"" which gives out funding grants for the summer and you get nice lectures, etc.  Overall great program - but more of a yield tool to pull in great applicants. Google it and you should find Columbia's page that explains it. So congrats for getting it and getting in!

If you're deciding between Columbia vs. Harvard, both are good choices.  I would personally go to Days on Campus and Harvard's equivalent (Visitas?!) and see where you like more.

Besides that, we can apply for funding for projects over the summer, I.e. if you wanted to do research on campus you could get a housing and food stipend which will probably be a few thousand dollars. That's basically it. There might be one or two fancy dinners you're invited to, but there isn't any preferential treatment given to you in classes or anything.

GPA and GRE don't matter above a low threshhold (cf. [grad school talk from Harchol-Baltar whose been an adcom at top schools](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf), PDF warning). The most important thing is that you have strong rec letters from well-known professors who supervised your research and some papes at the top conferences in your field to back up what the letters say. 

This for CS only. I think for legitimate disciplines like pure maths that you need a 4.0 and a good GRE and GRE Subject Test or else you're screwed. 

But it's whatever. Don't be a nerd. As my girl Allizae explains, [women want Double Ds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nClvm8JnQM) -- dudes with drive and determination, the kinda guy who runs a nice VC-backed startup -- not a guy who lounges around all day trying to make ω = 2 or whatever it is PhDumb computer nerds do. Like if a guy did pure maths, physics, or real engineering -- Allizae teaches that we should respect blue collar worker and specifically mentions latter -- then like that would be a turn on for a girl. But ""academic"" CS is just lower-middlebrow schlock for people without the IQs or D&D to do real intellectual shit, and ladies don't want to see that unless you're bringing in the papes.

A complaint against diversification mostly. We could debate the political reality of a group that lost the popular vote, but won the electoral, in a race where only half the country voted (one of the lowest turnouts on record). Or we could discuss the beliefs that there are a majority of folks that feel this way by those same numbers and speculate how Trump would have done against Obama... But why bother, thats not how our elections work and people believe what they are willing too. Minds can't be changed with facts or speculation. But you should not buy into this narrative and you can easily dismiss it with facts and statistics...

 Luckily for all of us Columbia, being a university, publishes all the hiring and candidate minority status figures... One click away you can see the illogical fallacy present in the words above.

http://www.columbia.edu/cu/opir/abstract.html

Pay attention to the non-minority in staff and student population. Then read all that above once again.  Somehow despite affirmative action, diversity, and political correctness a non-minority male group still leads the pile among ALL other groups. Despite being in one of the most diverse cities in the world one group still leads in comparison to all other groups and people. Draw the conclusion for yourself as to what this used to look like before there was any intention to force others to diversify. Also think about how this works over at Goldman Sachs or CITI or Outside a ""bubble"" where there is no such diversification mandate. Also don't try to debate the reasoning behind all the ""top"" candidates being from that non-minority male group lest you want to be drawn into a debate about phrenology and genetics.

 Just keep in mind, when you read stuff like this, where the reality is and probably will remain for a long time despite efforts to counter...

No, they don't, especially compared to poor African-American communities. Affirmative action isn't considered for socioeconomic conditions, but racial/ethnic, check the guidelines that Columbia publishes in the Common Data Set.
>Uh..they are a major voting block. They used to be called ""organized labor"" before unions fell out of style.
They very much are a focus of politics...

That's why Hillary never once visited Wisconsin after the DNC? And only made a last-minute push in Michigan because she realized she was fucked there due to her not giving it any attention?

Hillary's campaign was entirely built on identity politics for LGBT community, women, people of color, and other minority groups. It did *NOT* focus at all on white, working class people.

There's a reason why there's now a big push for midwestern, white male Tim Ryan to replace the Californian elite Nancy Pelosi as Minority Leader of the House. 

Many Democrats have realized they screwed up in ignoring this vital sector of the populace, but people, like you, who are still convinced Democrats did so much for them in the past few years is why Democrats will struggle for them to return to their esteemed ""Rainbow coalition.""

I can only say this anonymously but I think there are many others who feel the same,,"> But that's false. You are really mistaken if you think university is anymore of a true ""free market of intellectual ideas"" to be discussed. It's well documented the liberal bias and anti-conservatism strain in the university setting. University is no longer this utopia of intellectual thought.

Dude, if your ideas suck, then you can't claim persecution for them being shot down.  The northeast in general is more educated, more diverse, more liberal, that's a reality.  But that doesn't mean conservatism can't exist.  If your ideas can withstand critique, then I don't see why they can't exist at Columbia.  Hell, if even socialists can find a home here, then conservatives can too.  What I have a problem with is people who mistake criticism as persecution.  Conservative ideas, hell, all ideas, *will be* criticized at really any academic institution.   That's the point...and how learning occurs.

> well documented the liberal bias and anti-conservatism strain

Do you want Affirmative Action for your ideas?  They should be able to stand alone...on their merits.

> It's this phony belief that it is, when it very clearly isn't, why there is so much ""anti-intellectualism"" because it's really not any intellectual environment.

Pretty sure it's still intellectual.  Gotta love the guy invalidating the entire university because he can't build up the courage to speak his mind.

> A professor of mine, from a couple years back, said this himself and said he can't imagine why conservative students at Columbia would bother to speak up at Columbia when there is so much hostility directed at them and how it's effectively social suicide.

I can't believe it.  Do you want a safe space to voice your views?  Voicing pro-palestine views will alienate you from some jewish groups on campus, voicing pro-nazi views will alienate you from some leftists on campus, voicing ANY VIEW will cause social upheaval in your life.  But that's the point...a university isn't a safe space where your views exist in isolation.  You must be there to defend them, and if you can't, that's not the university's fault.

I can only say this anonymously but I think there are many others who feel the same,,"> Sociologists, in general, recognize ""race"" as a social construct. This means that, though the concepts of race and racism are based in observable biological characteristics, any conclusions drawn about race on the basis of those observations are heavily influenced by cultural ideologies. Racism, as an ideology, exists in a society at both the individual and the institutional level.

> While much of the research and work on racism in the last half-century or so has concentrated on ""white racism"" in the Western world, historical accounts of race-based social practices can be found across the globe.[26] Thus, racism can be broadly defined to encompass individual and group prejudices and acts of discrimination that result in material and cultural advantages conferred on a majority or dominant social group.[27] So-called ""white racism"" focuses on societies in which white populations are the majority or dominant social group. In studies of these majority white societies, the aggregate of material and cultural advantages is usually termed ""white privilege"".

> Race and race relations are prominent areas of study in sociology and economics. Much of the sociological literature focuses on white racism. Some of the earliest sociological works on racism were penned by sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois, the first African American to earn a doctoral degree from Harvard University. Du Bois wrote, ""The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.""[28] Wellman (1993) defines racism as ""culturally sanctioned beliefs, which, regardless of intentions involved, defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities"".[29] In both sociology and economics, the outcomes of racist actions are often measured by the inequality in income, wealth, net worth, and access to other cultural resources, such as education, between racial groups.[30]

> In sociology and social psychology, racial identity and the acquisition of that identity, is often used as a variable in racism studies. Racial ideologies and racial identity affect individuals' perception of race and discrimination. Cazenave and Maddern (1999) define racism as ""... a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. Racial centrality (the extent to which a culture recognizes individuals' racial identity) appears to affect the degree of discrimination African American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination.[31] Sellers and Shelton (2003) found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and social beliefs.[32]

> Some sociologists also argue that, particularly in the West where racism is often negatively sanctioned in society, racism has changed from being a blatant to a more covert expression of racial prejudice. The ""newer"" (more hidden and less easily detectable) forms of racism—which can be considered as embedded in social processes and structures—are more difficult to explore as well as challenge. It has been suggested that, while in many countries overt or explicit racism has become increasingly taboo, even in those who display egalitarian explicit attitudes, an implicit or aversive racism is still maintained subconsciously.[33]

> This process has been studied extensively in social psychology as implicit associations and implicit attitudes, a component of implicit cognition. Implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience.[34] Implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action toward social objects.[35] These thoughts, feelings or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware.[36]

> Therefore, subconscious racism can influence our visual processing and how our minds work when we are subliminally exposed to faces of different colors. In thinking about crime, for example, social psychologist Jennifer L. Eberhardt (2004) of Stanford University holds that, ""...blackness is so associated with crime you're ready to pick out these crime objects.""[37] Such exposures influence our mind and can cause subconscious racism in our behavior towards other people or even objects. Thus, racist thoughts and actions can arise from stereotypes and fears of which we are not aware.[38]",2,,False,dajxork,False,False,1480386000.0,2016-11-28 20:20:00

HS Dropout ... night school ... community college in CT ... Columbia GS (grad w/ honours) ... Georgetown Law (grad w/ honours) ... now run a consultancy with my wife (international non-profits, mainly UN agencies). 

Many credits transferred. Obviously nothing that didn't directly relate, so beware esoteric classes. 

You'll be in a different school, but the difference is primarily bureaucratic. Social scene will be fairly different depending on who you are/what age you are on entering. You won't live in the undergrad dorms (first couple years I was at I-House, then grad housing) so the community is a bit sparser. Save two or three core courses, there are no GS-only or CC-only classes (grad in 99, so things may be different now). So expect to be taking the same classes as students from the college--which can be fantastic or demanding depending on your background.

I'm having a REALLY hard time deciding between UPenn and Columbia for ED. I'm looking into anthropology and sociology potentially on a premed track. Does anyone have any advice?,coronavitae,"All the comments right now are good information and accurate, but I think they're missing one thing: planning your education based on anthro-socio double majoring is a bad move, and not because those are bad subjects. 

If you want to study anthro or sociology, Columbia is almost definitely the better place; almost all the top sociologists (not 100% about anthropologists) are in NYC, and you can attend lectures, take (some) classes, and find mentors across the universities in the city if you're really into that. The only time a major in either of those areas is going to matter is applying to a PhD program, and an anthropology PhD program isn't going to reject you because you majored in sociology and took a bunch of anthro courses without completing a major.

It doesn't sound like you even want to do a PhD at this point; med school isn't going to differentiate between these two interrelated social science fields. They're going to say ""cool, an Ivy-league humanities student with premed."" [Side-note, one of the top med-schools (Columbia maybe?) has a program where you can get admitted to medical school when you haven't started college or are a freshman or something, so long as you study a humanities subject and promise to complete premed. Consider looking into it.] 

Maybe most importantly, your major is likely to change while you're in college. Planning with this degree of specificity (ie calculating the credits for a double-major-premed-minor) is a little unproductive. A better question for considering Columbia ED is: do you want to spend your time completing the Core requirements? Would it be interesting to you? Are the subjects among the things you want to learn? It is a LOT of time, and it will have a big impact on your educational development, probably influencing which  major you choose and whether you go to med school or not. 

If you are planning (for now) to become a doctor, but you want to round yourself out with humanities study that interests you (Anthropology and Sociology) then Columbia would be a really good option. The core is a great preparation for (certain kinds of) humanities studies, and if you want to understand those dense sociology texts then Contemporary Civilizations is incredibly helpful. You will have the chance to go to lectures by the top anthropologists and sociologists in the world (if things ever get back to normal) and have a lot of options for mentorship. You may also get a boost applying to the medical school, and you will be well placed to take part in whatever medical internships are available at the undergraduate level. None of that would be affected by whether you can fit in a second major.

If you're more interested in trying a little bit of everything (while preparing for med-school or not), then the core requirements can be a real drag, and not getting to take as many major requirement courses in your first two years can mean that you don't really get a chance to change your major if you start to realize too late that you don't like those classes. Also, if you hate reading books by dead white men, the lit-hum is gonna be a drag.",5,,False,g5jdw09,False,False,1600306994.0,2020-09-16 20:43:14

Anthropology, sociology, and pre med all have a good amount of overlap too, so that’d make it a little easier.

For banking and consulting if you are from Wharton yes you may be able to compete with Columbia but if you are from other schools at Penn then Columbia wins so easily. The influence Columbia has in NYC far exceeds your imagination. 

As for top law firms, the law school at Columbia is considered a whole tier higher than Penn. There are firms that exclusively recruit from the top 6 schools but would not dig any deeper. Columbia also just had the best law school employment outcome for 7 years in a row out of all law schools and last year the number 1 ranked law firm Cravath recruited more candidates from Columbia than any other law school despite schools like Harvard and NYU having much larger class sizes. 

I am just not even going to comment on schools like Cornell Dartmouth and Brown.

Columbia is the only ivy that has a complete repertoire of schools/programs/majors that serve the comprehensive functions of a university: the undergrad, law/med/business, humanities, social sciences, engineering, revolutionary industry oriented schools like SPS the J-school. Harvard is shit at engineering. Yale is shit at everything that's not law. Princeton doesn't have any professional law school which is essentially a college. Penn's got wharton that overshadows its own brand. Again Im not going to comment on Dartmouth Brown and Cornell. Not a single ivy can exert influence in a similarly comprehensive fashion like Columbia. The only school that can present an even match rests on the west coast.

So technically they should've been posted today? But professor assignments will probably be unpredictable and/or posted later than usual due to COVID.

I'd like to again emphasize that my point is the majority of tuition money goes to professors, not that the majority of the university's income goes to professors. The university has five main sources of income, of which tuition is one. Think of it like five separate faucets that fill a pool. A lot of the university's income sources are restricted, like donations to the endowment that are specified for financial aid, for example. It would be illegal to use that money for paying professors. But tuition has no restrictions, so it can be used to pay whatever. Since faculty don't really have any source of restricted funds going towards them (unless they're an endowed professor, which is very rare) obviously they need to use unrestricted funds for their salaries.

CS at Columbia,ThePolychromat,"Hi! Senior here - I interned at Facebook during fall semester. Got contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn to start the application process in fall of 2018. I know plenty of other people working at big companies, too. It's definitely not uncommon.

I found freshman year a little rough recruiting-wise (partially due to my own dumb ass literally chickening out of the Google EP interview... live and learn) and ended up scraping something together part-time in my hometown off a family connection. Sophomore year I applied around and once again didn't get a whole lot of bites but managed to land an internship in the city (ended up being an absolutely killer experience despite being neither a strictly SWE internship nor a recognizable name). 

Junior year recruiting season was a whole different story. I spent so much time prepping/interviewing (flying 6 hours out to CA multiple weeks in a row) I ended up having to drop a class (Verma ML lmao), but in the end, I ended up having a lot of really great options. Lesson learned: Juniors are *way* more in-demand.

The difference between Columbia and Stanford? imo, negligible unless you're really interested in startups. Maybe the Stanford kid gets the Facebook internship his freshman year instead of his sophomore or junior year. But kids working at Facebook after their freshman year of college probably have way more coding experience than I did at that point, anyways, so it's hard to tell :p",2,,False,flwdkgj,False,False,1585547001.0,2020-03-30 00:43:21

Interview Etiquette?,chillearn,"Hey! I’m a first year so I had my interview fairly recently (December 2017). I’d say just wear nice clothing you feel comfortable talking in. You shouldn’t worry about readjusting your clothes, just the contents of the interview itself. I honestly think business casual might be a bit too much. For the most part interviews tend to be fairly relaxed and more just a way for the interviewer to get to know you and your interests. Like someone already said, do some research on the school as they’re bound to ask “why columbia” at some point. 

Also, at least in the states interviews are not mandatory for admission so sort of de jure they aren’t allowed to put a ton of emphasis on them when looking through applications. I think interviews are also seen as a way to get alumni involved with the school again. Basically don’t stress yourself too much and be candid and open; it should go well!

While I’m sure every interview is different, from people I’ve spoken to in dual degree programs they tend to ask about what extra curricular activities you’d be interested in joining, any historical figures you admire, news sources you read on a regular basis, why this program. 

If they do ask about your personal statements or application, don’t just rehash what you already wrote. Use it as an opportunity to expand and elaborate in more detail. 

Also, a general interview tip is to be prepared to talk about yourself and what you like. Nothing’s worse than when a person struggles to answer questions like “tell me about yourself” or “what are you passionate about?” 

As a guy I wore a suit and tie to all my college interviews. Can’t speak to hair and make up. Sorry! My rule is that it is better to be overdressed than underdressed.

Topics can be either specific to the major you selected or a current events topic that relates to something in your application (I was asked about International Political events of the time - recent elections in the US and other countries, the political affairs of a country I had studied abroad in) for about 25 minutes, and then they asked one of the usual university ""what are your strengths/weaknesses""  questions in the last 5 minutes. 

Some of my peers were asked a different balance - 15 minutes wider topics about politics, 15 minutes of usual interview style questions about goals, future plans, and academic history.

For the interview itself, I will echo what others have already mentioned. Be curious, open and friendly! Ask them about their own experience as an undergrad. Ask about the best class they took, what they majored in, what they like the most about Columbia, etc. You get my point.

> Nungesser&#039;s suit charged that the University failed to protect him from-and even encouraged-sustained protest by Sulkowicz, which Nungesser initially argued was a violation of Title IX. The University announced that it had settled the suit-for which Nungesser submitted a new complaint after his initial one was dismissed last year-in a conciliatory statement sent to Spectator Thursday.

> Nungesser then filed a new complaint alleging that Columbia exhibited gender-based harassment, sexual harassment, and gender-based misconduct against him without citing Title IX as its grounds.

Your experience at Columbia,hahahow,"In my experience, there are 2 main things that Columbia admissions officers like to hear: 1) The fact that we're ""in the city of new york,"" which is the stuff you mentioned above. There's definitely a ""New York"" feel to Columbia, which starkly contrasts against schools like Princeton and Dartmouth. It's pretty accurate and pervasive. 2) The Core. Write a small essay about why you love the Core, and you're golden. Your feelings about the Core may change, but that essay will last forever :) 
In a nutshell, those are the two things that make Columbia special: New York and the Core. 

The ACTUAL Columbia experience is far more complicated, and I'm not going to try to distill it all into one post. Maybe if you ask specific questions, I'll try to answer them. But Columbia is an amazing, amazing place that will humble and strengthen you. I'm sure you could say that about any college, but if I had to say two things I gained by being at Columbia, it's humility and strength.

Your experience at Columbia,cabensis,"I am a transfer student to SEAS. I wrote ...

1. talking about the core/NYC, the typical stuff haha
2. talking about the CS program/what I wanted out of my major, and opportunities in NYC
3. talked about my extracurricular interests. I breakdance, and in the one about extracurricular interests, I wrote intensively about that.

Columbia is a school without that much of a unifying identity, and if you come here, you will feel this. There's stuff like tree-lighting, orgo night (lol this year tho), homecoming, among others, but these are more like events/traditions that can't be said to be a unique identity. I personally feel like I am very, very involved, but primarily with the student organizations I am actually affiliated with. This is naturally what happens when you are in a big city. People just go around and do their own thing, some interacting with the city itself more than others. 

Admissions officers know this, they know that once we are let loose, we just find our own niche and stuff. If I could give advice, it would be that although throwing some lip service about the core/NYC is good, letting yourself and your interests take the spotlight in your application might not be a bad idea.

Your experience at Columbia,colecon1,"No matter where you go, college is what you make of it. However, this is especially true at Columbia. As previously mentioned, there is no ""unifying"" experience (besides maybe the core) like there is at other universities. New York City gives way to many opportunities, which a lot of students take advantage of and find their niche within. I often find that I am only on campus when I am walking to and from campus. On the weekend (Thursday evening - Sunday night), the campus is fairly desolate. So if you are looking for a traditional college experience (football, large campus, tight knit campus, etc), you will probably not enjoy your time here. However, if you are independent and looking for a flexible college experience, you will find that here. Also something that should not be overlooked is that the courses are fairly rigorous here as compared to other places. You cannot double count courses so if you want to double major, you have to take 5-6 classes a semester, so the workload adds up. Grades are decently inflated(~3.3 average/B+), but not like other places. ",3,,False,dbdoipx,False,False,1482155182.0,2016-12-19 07:46:22

Your experience at Columbia,hahahow,"Like I said, it's complicated. But I'll try to explain a little bit, cuz this wouldn't be reddit if I didn't try to distill a complex topic into a single poorly-written post. So here it goes. Columbia students, please chime in if you agree/disagree with the following: 

As far as the ""humbling"" part, I DONT mean that you're surrounded by a bunch of people just as smart as you. Instead, it's more about gaining a new perspective about what's really important, and losing all your entitlement/pretentiousness/grandiosity left over from being an over-achiever in high school. Students come in with their self-worth pretty tied up with their impressive achievements, but we graduate from columbia with a more healthy sense of self-worth. If you're a perfectionistic overachiever who is fueled by teachers' and parents' praise (like I was), you're in for an astounding transformation.

As far are Columbia being ""strengthening"", there's obviously the rigorous course load, but I think more importantly there's this intimidating lack of built-in community/support that ends up strengthening you. A lot of colleges have a strong sense of school culture, and it's relatively straight-forward for people to feel like they ""belong"" by joining in on the ""unifying experiences."" At Columbia, students really have to fend for themselves as far as building their communities--more so than at other schools (at least that's my sense). And I think that's a skill that a lot of other people don't learn until after they graduate college, when they're living off on their own for the first time. But Columbia students learn these skills very early on, and I'm endlessly thankful for that. I've seen a lot of wide-eyed, scared, small-school freshman grow into secure, confident, and competent New Yorkers who could easily move into an NYC apartment and be functional adults. 

Again, I'd really appreciate if Columbia people would chime in and agree/disagree #starvingforvalidation",2,,1482649994.0,dblvf8o,False,False,1482648738.0,2016-12-25 00:52:18

How is the current CS department at Columbia?,weaverwasher,"My main complaint is that there simply aren't enough spaces in advanced courses such that most students don't really get a chance to take all the advanced courses they want to take. You won't really get a chance to take all the courses you want to take because they're always so full, you're competing with grad students, and the department refuses to offer more sections or increase course enrolment. This becomes a huge issue when you want to take advanced courses to make yourself a marketable candidate but you simply cannot get into the courses like Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The Department needs to toughen up and get more money from Columbia, and double the amount of spots for advanced (4000 level+) courses to make the department more competitive. Sometimes I feel like I go to a state school because I shouldn't be concerned at COLUMBIA about not being able to take a class that I'm qualified for because there isn't enough space. My personal solution to solving this problem is to create separate classes for undergraduate and graduate students but not everyone would agree with this.",13,,False,d1yym91,False,False,1460408959.0,2016-04-11 16:09:19
How is the current CS department at Columbia?,clm100,"Most of this thread is fairly factually accurate, but I feel like overall it misses the fact that CS is a solid department, with decent faculty and attention to students, and graduates largely do well after. Yes, there are problems. However, overall I'd say it's better than many other departments, but sure, worse than some. However it's also probably the department with the most growth in the university (and the US overall). What worked well with a fourth the number of majors and masters students fails now.

How is the current CS department at Columbia?,air2112,"Undergrads are given priority initially with the classes capped at around 40 people. Then Grad students are let in and the class sizes expand to 100+. Although this past semester, they had a custom wait list system that was based on an short response you wrote as to why you should take the class, which, honestly didn't make much sense. A lot of qualified undergrads got kicked out of classes they deserved to take and it was extremely frustrating for those involved. 

/u/weaverwasher is right; we should have separate classes for undergrad and grad students. The department is facing a huge scaling problem. Hopefully the department does increase in administrative power and doesn't have the waitlist system again. I personally never ran into an issue of waitlist because as a junior and senior, I had priority selection over the 4000-level courses, but that seems to be changing.",5,,False,d1zi1lq,False,False,1460440804.0,2016-04-12 01:00:04
