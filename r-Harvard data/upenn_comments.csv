Gerald R Ford Stuck in an elevator day upvote party year 3!!!,Cp9_Giraffe,"I saw Gerald Ford at a grocery store in Philadelphia yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",39,,False,g5tqjo4,False,False,1600529635.0,2020-09-19 10:33:55

Words of Advice to the Class of '23 from a Current Freshman,CasaBlancoJR1177,"> Figure out a tentative four year plan by the end of your first year

The earlier this is done, the better, especially in regards to picking classes. Be very deliberate with your course choices if you have a very good sense of the majors/minors you would like to do because it gives you more flexibility later on if you see you'd like to challenge yourself with another major/minor if that's your thing. Take the first year to explore, but if you will explore beyond first year, definitely keep in mind the sector/liberal arts requirements along the way by doing @ least one a semester to stay on track for graduation.

And please be sure to ask other, older Penn students and Penn redditors for course recommendations, best professors, classes to avoid, etc. Don't settle for less, make sure you get the best professors for the courses you take, especially the large lecture ones (Ex. Prof. Nakia Rimmer for math courses).",1,,False,etzh44m,False,False,1563331710.0,2019-07-16 21:48:30

There is no protocol in place, and they are making the decisions they can to direct 50k people while also concerned with their own families. Just take a moment to prioritize you own health and well-being, be considerate of the effect all your actions have on others, and understand the university is no way trying to harm you in this situation. If you are in a special circumstance, ask for help before leveraging your social networking position to bash an entire institution. Glad somebody said this.

obviously they're anxiously figuring this out, but there are students from war-torn countries, countries with closed borders and other circumstances who have nowhere to go. they have a right to complain, they're probably terrified. let's stop acting like a lot of the steps penn took weren't also for liability purposes so they wouldn't be responsible for anyone if anything bad happened.

im really trying to figure out how in all of this, you managed to conclude that Penn is who should be receiving sympathy. i think their communication needs improvement. they've sent emails behind students' backs, vague emails with little info, and they've had to send multiple follow ups to clear up confusion. i guess people just expected better from such an ""elite institution.""",11,,False,fkvk2r0,False,False,1584570808.0,2020-03-18 17:33:28
you guys gotta stop with this,Marbleman60,"Upenn is doing everything right. 

PSA. READ ME.

""We can now read the report on COVID-19 that so terrified every public health manager and head of state from Boris Johnson to Donald Trump to the dictator of El Salvador that they ordered people to stay in their houses. I read it yesterday afternoon and haven't been the same since. I urge everyone to read it, but maybe have a drink first, or have your family around you. It is absolutely terrifying. The New York Times confirms that the CDC and global leaders are treating it as factual.

Here's a brief rundown of what I'm seeing in here. Please correct me in comments if I'm wrong.

The COVID-19 response team at Imperial College in London obtained what appears to be the first accurate dataset of infection and death rates from China, Korea, and Italy. They plugged those numbers into widely available epidemic modeling software and ran a simulation: what would happen if the United States did absolutely nothing -- if we treated COVID-19 like the flu, went about business as usual, and let the virus take its course?

Here's what would happen: 80% of Americans would get the disease. 0.9% of them would die. Between 4 and 8 percent of all Americans over the age of 70 would die. 2.2 million Americans would die from the virus itself.

It gets worse. Most people who are in danger of dying from COVID-19 need to be put on ventilators. 50% of those put on ventilators still die, but the other 50% live. But in an unmitigated epidemic, the need for ventilators would be 30 times the number of ventilators in the United States. Virtually no one who needed a ventilator would get one. 100% of patients who need ventilators would die if they didn't get one. So the actual death toll from the virus would be closer to 4 million Americans -- in a span of 3 months. 8-15% of all Americans over 70 would die.

How many people is 4 million Americans? It's more Americans than have died all at once from anything, ever. It's the population of Los Angeles. It's four times the number of Americans who died in the Civil War...on both sides combined. It's two-thirds as many people as died in the Holocaust.

Americans make up 4.4% of the world's population. So if we simply extrapolate these numbers to the rest of the world -- now we're getting into really fuzzy estimates, so the margin of error is pretty great here -- this gives us 90 million deaths globally from COVID-19. That's 15 Holocausts. That's 1.5 times as many people as died in World War II, over 12 years. This would take 3-6 months.

Now, it's unrealistic to assume that countries wouldn't do ANYTHING to fight the virus once people started dying. So the Imperial College team ran the numbers again, this time assuming a ""mitigation"" strategy. A mitigation strategy is pretty much what common sense would tell us to do: America places all symptomatic cases of the disease in isolation. It quarantines their families for 14 days. It orders all Americans over 70 to practice social distancing. This is what you've seen a lot of people talking about when they say we should ""flatten the curve"": try to slow the spread of the disease to the people most likely to die from it, to avoid overwhelming hospitals.

And it does flatten the curve -- but not nearly enough. The death rate from the disease is cut in half, but it still kills 1.1 million Americans all by itself. The peak need for ventilators falls by two-thirds, but it still exceeds the number of ventilators in the US by eight times, meaning most people who need ventilators still don't get them. That leaves the actual death toll in the US at right around 2 million deaths. The population of Houston. Two civil wars. One-third of the Holocaust. Globally, 45 million people die: 7.5 Holocausts, 3/4 of World War II. That's what happens if we use common sense: the worst death toll from a single cause since the Middle Ages.

Finally, the Imperial College team ran the numbers a third time, this time assuming a ""suppression"" strategy. In addition to isolating symptomatic cases and quarantining their family members, they also simulated social distancing for the entire population. All public gatherings and most workplaces shut down. Schools and universities close. (Note that these simulations assumed a realistic rate of adherence to these requirements, around 70-75% adherence, not that everyone follows them perfectly.) This is basically what we are seeing happen in the United States today.

This time it works! The death rate in the US peaks three weeks from now at a few thousand deaths, then goes down. We hit, but don't exceed (at least not by very much), the number of available ventilators. The nightmarish death tolls from the rest of the study disappear; COVID-19 goes down in the books as a bad flu instead of the Black Death.

But here's the catch: if we EVER relax these requirements before a vaccine is administered to the entire population, COVID-19 comes right back and kills millions of Americans in a few months, the same as before. The simulation does indicate that, after the first suppression period (lasting from now until July), we could probably lift restrictions for a month, followed by two more months of suppression, in a repeating pattern without triggering an outbreak or overwhelming the ventilator supply. If we staggered these suppression breaks based on local conditions, we might be able to do a bit better. But we simply cannot ever allow the virus to spread throughout the entire population in the way other viruses do, because it is just too deadly. If lots of people we know end up getting COVID-19, it means millions of Americans are dying. It simply can't be allowed to happen.

How quickly will a vaccine be here? Already, medical ethics have been pushed to the limit to deliver one. COVID-19 was first discovered a few months ago. Last week, three separate research teams announced they had developed vaccines. Yesterday, one of them (with FDA approval) injected its vaccine into a live person, without waiting for animal testing. Now, though, they have to monitor the test subject for fourteen months to make sure the vaccine is safe. This is the part of the testing that can't be rushed: the plan is to inoculate the entire human population, so if the vaccine itself turned out to be lethal for some reason, it could potentially kill all humans, which is a lot worse than 90 million deaths. Assuming the vaccine is safe and effective, it will still take several months to produce enough to inoculate the global population. For this reason, the Imperial College team estimated it will be about 18 months until the vaccine is available.

During those 18 months, things are going to be very difficult and very scary. Our economy and our society will be disrupted in profound ways. Worst of all, if the suppression policies actually work, it will feel like we are doing all this for nothing, because the infection and death rates will be very low. It's easy to get people to come together in common sacrifice in the middle of a war. It's very hard to get them to do so in a pandemic that looks invisible precisely because suppression methods are working. But that's exactly what we're going to have to do.""

They’re also paying for flights home as well as reimbursing previously purchased May flights for FGLI community. Also, providing stipends for food security and internet packages. I doubt that more than ~10% of the dorm body are from war-torn countries, and find it incredibly hard to believe that Penn would condemn somebody form a lvl3 quarantined country to return. If that is the case, then they are definitely in the wrong and should work to continue accommodating those who need that. But with all they have offered so far, I cannot agree that Penn abandoned and failed to acknowledge the group of students in need.

Other than Columbia being ranked over Yale  (and perhaps MIT being ranked over Yale -closer call) I really have no problem with the list which is  really not that meaningful if you are fortunate enough to attend the top 10-20 of these schools.  I have no idea where these applaud emojis came from and it either a dumb mistake or bad humor... but it doesn't bother me.  I can see Penn being ranked anywhere between 6 and 10 depending upon your priorities and anywhere in the top 12 is terrific.  Any lower than that for Penn, I would have an issue.  I believe Penn has many solid top 5 and top 10 subject concentrations and is in the top 20 in almost all major disciplines with major interdisciplinary opportunities and research opportunities galore.  The business and medical schools are always in that top 5 tier as is nursing and the graduate programs are strong across the board.  Penn is doing just fine.  This year they put more negative emphasis on student debt and I hope that is not the reason why Penn lost a couple of notches.  But I have not looked into this so I am not sure what the reason is.",18,,False,g5eurhq,False,False,1600209712.0,2020-09-15 17:41:52

US News Drops Penn’s Ranking and then has the audacity to comment clapping emojis,singularreality,"This is a really substantial news story, and is, breaking news.  In the end, this pandemic is a HUGE problem and has enormous financial repercussions for all universities.  I can completely understand wanting to put your resources into the students whose research and clinical and lab experiences have been eradicated by this filthy pandemic. But, it should show all of us that this is serious, not only in its health effects but in its effect on education!  Penn is probably not going to be able to do things like pay PILOT (payments in lieu of taxes) to help fix the Philly school system or to fund all the social or other absolutely righteous causes that may need attention at this time.  Penn is your educational institution and needs to be generous but this generosity must be to provide undergraduate and graduates students with the college experience and training and financial aid that are part of Penn's core values.  I argue that Penn should begin to figure out how alternative and cost effective on campus experiences beyond four years should be made available to Penn students that are having multiple semesters diluted by this pandemic.  During this time, we should be asking Penn to use its vast endowment for educational purposes for those adversely affected by the pandemic.  If there is ever a time to break the piggy bank a little, it is now.  If you want to go up in the rankings respond to this pandemic by steadfastly holding on to what Penn does well, educate scholars by committing to a real on-campus and affordable experience, even if drawn out or provided over several summer sessions, so that Penn students can truly go out  in the world to use knowledge, hopefully for good.",4,,False,g5f953e,False,False,1600217649.0,2020-09-15 19:54:09

Doesn’t matter that increasing tuition at a time like this is a fundamentally wrong thing for a billion-dollar institution to impose on thousands of students.",5,,False,fy81n8i,False,False,1594875172.0,2020-07-15 23:52:52

Yea...,bulimicomrade,"I originally asked, ""wouldn't this only impact rich people,"" then responded with the intent to get clarification on where I felt it was still unclear to me. I didn't know that Penn didn't take into account the different living expenses of students' families depending on where they're from, nor did I know that they didn't take into account whether parents have other adult dependents to care for. I also didn't know that Penn has reduced certain students' aid after the pandemic started. 

I argued against points that I didn't think were true, such as that Penn doesn't take into account whether you have siblings in college, which it does, but I didn't argue against points that I didn't consider before. I did bring up the appeal process because it worked for me, but I didn't know that others had been screwed over. It makes a bit more sense to me now how the increases in tuition are harming upper-middle class people, and that's why I asked in the first place. I don't think I should be attacked for asking questions.",0,,False,fy829q3,False,False,1594875635.0,2020-07-16 00:00:35
Yea...,pennquaker18,"I haven’t paid enough attention to the issue to have an informed opinion, and don’t want to simply label it as greed without knowing more about the situation. It seems like people here have mentioned that peer universities are providing more support, which is frustrating.

In any case, I think they should issue debt rather than touch the endowment. Maybe there’s a reason why universities haven’t already done this that someone can point out, but right now AAA/AA bonds are trading at super tight yields. Penn could easily issue a large bond that supports students during the pandemic. This would be cheaper than taking from the endowment.",2,,False,fy78740,False,False,1594857322.0,2020-07-15 18:55:22

Why the Coronavirus pandemic is dangerous,emeraldor,"On the self-quarantine at home point: does China have the same suburban sprawl that the US has? As in, does China have the same number of single-family homes? I can see how self quarantining in an apartment building might be dangerous, however for mild cases in a single-family home that is separated from the rest of the population this could definitely limit spread. Self-quarantine is not as ineffective as you might think, and orders from the CDC/health departments should be followed. 

Mild cases will overwhelm our system, so only severe cases should be treated in a hospital setting. Also, before you go to the hospital, make sure to call your healthcare provider so they can prepare.",5,,False,fkhb1es,False,False,1584194216.0,2020-03-14 08:56:56

Why the Coronavirus pandemic is dangerous,Fredh21,"Ur right. There is a mix-up when I was trying to phrase the self-quarantine part. US certainly has more single-family houses so self quarantining is less risky compared with other countries. I was mainly criticizing the UK's quarantine order. As for the US, I think the problem is the slow testing. Drive-through test and (self) quarantine is good for the US.  

However, self-quarantine can still pose a threat to family members. In Wuhan, self-quarantine people infected their families rather than neighbors. It's might be hard to avoid family transmission even in single-family homes. 

But anyway, anything comes at a cost. Every gov should find a balance between saving current patients and protecting the system.

btw, calling the healthcare provider in advance is a good point. I should mention that",4,,False,fkhc9lp,True,False,1584195177.0,2020-03-14 09:12:57

 Not a current student, but very sad that it will now be, for some, a full year of your 4 year experience on line.  While you will have fine teachers and support, you cannot possibly get the equivalent ""world class"" education or experience that comes with on campus life.  However those of you that are most resilient will find a way and I truly wish you all a solid year at school and for classes to resume in the Spring, in person.",2,,False,g1ipzim,False,False,1597463028.0,2020-08-14 22:43:48

Bring Back Fall Break,martinsvineyard,"For many (basically those receiving aid but not full aid), it's actually cheaper for a lot of people to be at school than at home. For some reason it's something that's hard for people to fathom (as they don't understand how aid is calculated even with being at home as an option) but it's those whose families get aid but not enough have this situation. Also for juniors and seniors, the main group of people off campus, they already have leases with friend groups. Yeah they can break the leases or sublet but many things complicate this and given that the situation seems ideal being with your roommates - it's like why not. Also, tack on the fact that people want to get out of their homes to have a better study space, be away from their family/independence, abusive households, etc... Also, as I mentioned before, the main group of people staying are upperclassmen, and while it may seem bad, they would prefer to enjoy their last year on campus before graduating and being in the real world.

Sacrificing independence and privacy, having to take classes remotely, all of that sucks. 

That said - this is a global pandemic. This is a (hopefully) once-in-a-lifetime shitty situation. The choices you make now, the sacrifices you make now, are ones that will stay with you for the rest of your life. Make the selfish choices, and they will haunt you. 

To be even more frank: the stuff you are having to sacrifice is not life or death, and many many people are choosing to make that sacrifice in order to help others. The numbers for health care workers alone are heartbreaking.

You can do this. You'll be okay. Seek help, and honestly: I feel a lot of the same stuff you do. This has been awful for my mental health as well, and my grades suffered horribly. I'm anxious and depressed all the time these days. I just lost my dog as well. This whole thing fucking sucks. But the sacrifices we make, in the grand scheme of things, are small potatoes.

"not sure if i can post this, but",singularreality,"It is ok to rant like this and your feelings and concerns are justified.  And, I have been supporting Penn's effort to re-open in some fashion even with the vast majority of classes being online.  On the other hand, your post raises some other side-issues and I would like to bring them to a head on this post.

1. We are in an international health emergency.  It does ""suck"".  There will be no scenario where things will be anywhere near what you envisioned.  This is a loss, plain and simple and as an alum, I am very sorry.  But, I hope Penn continues its course of action and if the virus is reasonably under control on campus, maybe even open things up more.  The trend is not particularly good right now but better therapeutics are around the corner as well as more sophisticated testing and contact tracing techniques... if Penn can execute and if you and all students will comply with the campus pact you may very well have your independence this fall, but it will still be a watered down and restrictive environment.  You need to stay tough... this is one of life's curve balls... resiliency is something we are all gonna need during this time.
2. Penn Face is a characteristic that you or others choose to adopt or reject.  The everything is ok mindset, when it is not, is most definitely not unique to Penn.  In reading the DP, these Reddit pages etc., over the years, I see a somewhat enlightened  Penn emerging which acknowledges, recognizes and gradually have tried (with some success) to help those with managing social problems and all levels of unhealthy stress, anxiety including more serious mental illness . It is a work in progress but improving. Be true to yourself and know that there are different and accepting peer groups and philosophies and that most students face some levels of unhealthy anxiety and many experience some depression (usually Freshman year, but it could obviously extend further) and have a myriad of other struggles.   Penn is a reasonably diverse school and the way you and your peers will thrive is to be open and share your views , your struggles and your suggestions, like you did somewhat here, to make things better.. never to deny your vulnerabilities or problems or  pretend everything is great.  You can still walk down Locust Walk with a smile even if things are not ok... everyone knows that things are not always ok.... and there is not a person on this planet  that can honestly adopt an ""everything is ok"" mindset right now.. it is not. I agree, f-Penn Face... As far as I am concerned it is no longer a thing -- bury it.  Stay strong.",4,,False,g0sml8o,False,False,1596899504.0,2020-08-08 10:11:44

It’s only the end of week 1 and I already feel like I don’t belong here,shepard2025,"Please know that you aren't alone. 

Everyone I know is struggling with online learning and it isn't something anyone is comfortable with. Even before this, we struggled. Penn is a very difficult school. I'm assuming you are a freshman and this is the first time you have been assigned large assignments like this. I won't lie, it's going to be like that. It's a completely different environment than high school.

But it's very challenging for most people. You say that it seems like no one is struggling, but that's just the Penn Face. I can garauntee that most are finding this very hard, and that many are crying about it and are experiencing imposter syndrome. Literally everyone I know is. 

It's true that some people will and are adapting easily and naturally perform well, but don't compare yourself to them. We all have our own unique and valid experiences. For me personally, it can take me hours and hours to complete a problem set than a friend can do in half an hour. It doesn't mean I'm not as smart as them. It just means we learn differently. 

Growing out of Penn Face and the general high-achieving student mindset that we must get all A's and that we must be the best is something that we all must get through- it's incredibly damaging to mental health. The truth is that in the end, you don't need to adhere to anyone's expectations. You don't need certain grades or friends. You don't always need to be OK. It is ok to struggle, to fail. You are still valid and you belong. We all do.

I have to say that your last comment concerns me... If you need to talk to someone, reach out to CAPS. I know there is mixed opinions about it but I personally had a great experience. They can help you manage stress and time management, and help with any anxiety or depression you are experiencing.

Skim it, or skip it. Optional practice problems? Just extra if you have time. You can decide how much effort you want to put into these optional, free form things. Homeworks are less flexible, so they can take priority. Tests are very important. So are papers.

However, you should do what you need to be successful. If you can’t pull off not reading each page closely, then you should probably do that. If you need the extra practice, then do those practice problems. You can decide now what works and what doesn’t work for you, without someone hovering over you to make sure you did every single thing. This freedom can be liberating, but it can also be dangerous.

I’m sure it’s even harder right now because you’re isolated from other students so it’s harder to realise that you’re not alone in this struggle. 

It’ll get better, give it time and you’ll learn how to adapt to this new system. It could also be that this prof doesn’t match well with you, but others will. Give it some time, it took me the better part of my first year to feel like I was finally not just struggling to get by.

Penn is a really tough school, and honestly even as a sophomore I'm looking at one of my classes like what the fuck how am I even going to survive this. But it's ok!! Just like entering high school, it's all about finding out what method works for you the best, whether reaching out during office hours, to TA's, or just develop your own schedule and system.

Second off, I know this is already echoed but yes seconding skimming! When I was a freshman, I took a class that our prof would just arbitrarily give us 70 page journals to read and it felt insane. However, after talking with him individually, he basically told me all you need to do is understand what the graphs are saying and read the headlines. The rest of it is basically fluff.

It’s only the end of week 1 and I already feel like I don’t belong here,redlionxyz,"As a fellow freshman, this first week has been equal parts exhilarating and fun. However,  I have definitely felt stressed out the entire time regardless of if I was having fun (trying to learn about as many clubs as possible that I'm interested in or relaxing by watching videos and playing games}, in-class (grasping the material upon first hearing it during lecture or getting completely lost and then staying lost for the rest of the time or grinding a hard assignment and really feeling proud and good about it and then receiving it graded with a 22/30  and the answer which I was most proud of and spent the longest on graded as 0 points and being completely wrong), or just trying to learn how to do college especially this virtual version of it (forcing myself to use a goddamn calendar and be an organized human (which I am by nature not) or just making sure I go outside or adjusting my messed up sleep schedule from summer to school). Throughout this week, I have definitely felt a rollercoaster of emotions in many directions despite my overall feeling of contentment.

Since PennFace goes directly against my personal morals of conduct, I've tried to be as authentic, open, and sincere about everything, up to where I've felt comfortable, to combat this ""fronting"". Even though my week wasn't a smattering success, it was one of relative success, and yet I still had moments of doubt. For instance, when I saw my grade on Gradescope for my first CIS 160 HW assignment, it felt surreal even though everyone had been trying to prepare me to switch mindsets from the High School one of ""getting the grade"" and ""I can do most things and get an A no problem"" to ""learning for the sake of learning"" and ""grades are a measure of how much you know and what you need to study first and foremost"". Even though I prepared myself for a score I wasn't used to receiving, actually seeing it definitely caused me anxiety about the class and my faculties. This wasn't aided when someone asked in the class GroupMe if people wanted to share their score and I shared my score first not knowing that everyone else who answered after me had a significantly higher score and there would be a post on piazza visible to everyone giving grade statistics.  But when I felt the negativity creep up and doubts form, I immediately reached out to friends and family complaining about my score and how I could have messed up. Additionally, when reviewing the homework solutions in a recitation review session, I spoke about my concerns about my score despite being cognizant of the advice that I had been given earlier. Voicing some of my anxiety helped bring me back to reality and hearing their responses, even though many ultimately echoed the same sentiment in different forms, reminded me of the correct mindset for being able to learn effectively.

While this is just my anecdote about my first school week (and one day of the weekend) at Penn and my, personally speaking, major struggle for the week, I am sure this is just one of many that people have experienced especially us Freshman. Don't let the harsh harsh reality of not seeing much of other people's struggle lead you to feel that you are inferior or don't belong. I would seek emotional help or just vent to someone you can trust. For me, my friends from high school have been the best at keeping me grounded as well as my parents. And if you don't have that/don't want to access that, while I have not used CAPS, in high school when I had difficulties regarding my mental health, talking to a therapist, while not a miracle drug that will solve all underlying issues for you, can definitely help you feel better, even if just marginally, in just being able to unload and know that someone is there to hear you and help you without judgment.",1,,False,g47cfsj,False,False,1599367387.0,2020-09-05 23:43:07

It’s only the end of week 1 and I already feel like I don’t belong here,shepard2025,"I'll echo what another commenter has said- you basically need to find what works for you. This semester sucks especially with us having to basically teach ourselves, but to be quite honest I was doing that for a lot of in-person classes too. 

Large assignments such as a huge number of pages to read can be very daunting. I recommend spreading it out and reading a few each day if you can, but honestly I would just skim it. 15 pages may seem like a lot especially for a first college assignment, but I've had professors assign over 100 pages over two days before. I, of course, did not read it. Most readings I've had to do are filled with fluff. Doing practice problems without looking at the solutions is the best way to succeed. And getting help in office hours. Don't hesitate to go to office hours! 

The amount of work you choose to do is up to you. The best way to adapt is to finesse. Find out what your weaknesses are and focus solely on them. You don't want to waste time reading when you can be practicing. Put homework assignments and anything with a grade first. I've made it through classes without ever opening the textbook, but there are others where the textbook was my clutch. 

Do not approach these courses the same as you would high school classes! They are very very different. You probably aren't going to be able to get every single thing done. That's ok. Many college professors, especially the ones I've had here at Penn, are happy to work with you. It never hurts to shoot them an email asking for an extension or to talk about personal struggles in the class (how can I do better? How can I complete these assignments on time?). I even had one professor let me skip class for a week to go on vacation! (That was rare, I wouldn't recommend trying that LOL) 

It is ok to feel overwhelmed. Do some self reflection on what you want for yourself, what you can feasibly achieve, and most importantly go easy on yourself.",30,,1599365263.0,g45m96w,False,False,1599333737.0,2020-09-05 14:22:17
It’s only the end of week 1 and I already feel like I don’t belong here,Onegin,"I'm a grad student who has TA'd and taught several classes, so let me offer you a little practical advice for navigating this. First off, as the thoughtful poster above said, you're absolutely not alone and it's okay to feel overwhelmed and out of place. Nothing is wrong with you. You belong here, you are important, and you're not alone.

Assignments aren't meant to have you teach things to yourself. If you are given a bunch of shit to read that you are having a difficult time with, don't just focus on forcing yourself to make some sense of it— find pieces that DO make sense to you, and then make notes of what you don't understand. A huge function of assignments is to help students identify things they find challenging— a lot of time something makes total sense when a professor is explaining it but then when you sit down to do it yourself (whether it's reading a text critically, or doing problem sets) you find yourself thinking ""wait what the fuck?"" So instead of beating yourself, identify WHAT you're stumbling on— are certain terms unclear to you? Do you not follow how the author is drawing their conclusions? Is an equation giving you trouble? 

That will give you a very clear list of things to then address, either by raising them in class or, even better!, in office hours with the professor. Office hours are meant to be used, both with a professor and TA, and I can tell you that I *love* when a student comes in with specific questions about the material and we can work together to clarify things. We don't expect you to understand everything: that's why you're in the class! We also don't expect you to teach it to yourself: we expect you to earnestly engage with the material and, when something is unclear, ask for our help in figuring it out. 

I'll also say this: we do care about you and don't want you to feel overwhelmed and hopeless in our classes. This semester is a learning curve for everyone. It is totally and utterly *fine* to email your TA (who are often overwhelmed grad students themselves!) and say, ""look I'm having trouble managing the workload, or understanding these things, or whatever. Do you have any advice?"" I've TA'd for.... 3 years? Taught 4 classes of my own? I always love when students do that. We care about you, especially the new freshmen who are learning all this shit for the first time. It's okay to ask for help— that is what we are here for. Being as specific as possible about what you need help with only makes it easier for us to help you build up the necessary skills.",5,,False,g48itni,False,False,1599404715.0,2020-09-06 10:05:15

A Message from President Amy Gutmann and Provost Wendell Pritchett

to the Penn Community on the Coronavirus and

Important Changes to Our Operations for the Remainder of the Semester

 

The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, presents our world, country and University with a unique public health challenge that is all the more disquieting because of the uncertainties associated with its spread.  We write today with the latest update on the additional steps we at Penn will take in dealing with this unprecedented challenge, guided by current data and expert advice.  We will continue to communicate with you and update our plans as new data and evidence emerges.  Our primary goals, as always, are carrying out our educational, research and clinical care missions while ensuring the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors.

 

To help us achieve these goals under demanding conditions, we are compelled to make major changes to the final weeks of the semester.  We take these steps after much deliberation and with a determination to ensure that our students continue to receive the finest education in the world.  This cannot come without disruption in the normal routine of things.  Together we will work our way through these difficulties, guided by the inimitable spirit that makes this University so special.

 

The COVID-19 virus is readily spread through close human contact, which is a fact of life in a university environment, whether in classrooms, dining halls or at University events.  Eliminating large gatherings and creating social distancing are important steps to help prevent the spread of the disease.

 

To achieve that, we are announcing these measures:

 

•                     Spring Break is being extended for one week for all students, except for those students in health-related Schools and programs in which Spring Break has already occurred or who are actively engaged in clinical rotations.  During this time, the University will complete planning to migrate all classroom teaching to virtual instruction for both undergraduate and graduate classes beginning Monday, March 23rd.  Virtual instruction will continue through the remainder of the spring semester including examinations.  Graduate and professional Schools will notify their students about their specific schedules.

•                     In the critically important interest of public health, if at all possible, students who are currently out of town should not return to campus.  Students who are on campus should depart effective Sunday, March 15th.  University staff will be available and do their best to assist departing students.  We will work with students in the College Houses or University housing who do not come back to campus from Spring Break to facilitate the return of their belongings.  We will support those students living in the College Houses or University housing who are absolutely unable to return home for personal reasons.  For students on financial aid, we will work with you to ensure you are supported in this emergency transition.

•                     Medical, Dental, Veterinary and some Nursing students will continue their clinical rotations. Information about clinical experiences will be handled separately by the Schools and details will soon be provided in a separate communication from the respective Deans.

•                     Guidance on completion of labs and other non-classroom academic activities for graduate and professional students will be provided by each school.  PhD students who are on dissertation status or have completed their coursework will be advised separately in consultation with their graduate deans and the Vice Provost for Education, as we recognize individual research is different from classroom education.

•                     We are actively working with departments and programs at the undergraduate level to ensure comparable academic experiences are provided virtually.

•                     Whether students remain on campus or return home, all classes will be provided by virtual instruction, and on-campus activities will be limited.

 

Many details are still being finalized, so we ask for your patience as we work through the myriad issues involved in this major temporary change.  There will be ongoing communications as more details unfold.  We are determined that our efforts will be guided by a commitment to fairness in helping students complete the semester as seamlessly as possible.  We will work diligently to ensure that every Penn student continues to receive a high-quality Penn education, and to ensure that graduating students can do so on time and without delay or interruption.  As disruptive as this might be on the surface, we will do everything in our power to minimize its interference with learning, which is the reason we are all here.

 

The University has created a website (https://coronavirus.upenn.edu) to answer many of the questions you will have about this decision.  We will be vigilant in keeping the site updated as new events move forward.  Should you have questions not answered by this information, please email Coronavirus@upenn.edu.

 

Faculty with specific academic questions can receive guidance from their School Deans. Staff should not hesitate to contact their managers or the Penn Solutions Center at 215-898-7372 or www.solutioncenter.upenn.edu.

 

In this stressful time, we want to remind all students that there are extensive support resources available.  One call to the HELP LINE can assist you in finding personal and mental health support.  Similarly, faculty and staff always have access to Penn’s Employee Assistance Program: https://www.hr.upenn.edu/PennHR/wellness-worklife/counseling-and-employee-assistance-program.

 

Our thanks to everyone at Penn who has contributed to the planning for the remainder of the semester.  This is a unique and difficult challenge.  To get through, we need to work together and look out for each other along the way.  We are one Penn community, we will continue to be one Penn community, and we are grateful for your partnership in helping us make the remainder of this semester a productive and healthy one for all of our students.

 

With all best wishes,

                                                                                   

Amy Gutmann, President

I am not saying you should, that's up to you, but it definitely helped me, and it really made a difference in improving my mental health. Moreover, what I have done to cope with the feeling of loneliness is to call my friends/FaceTime and simply chat, go out and bike or walk long distance, take in nature, etc. If you have friends in town, and if permitting, call them and ask if they want to hang out, and practice proper safety like masks, social distancing, and such :).

Also, to put this into perspective, there's going to be a ton of restrictions on gatherings and activities at Penn, and since everyone gets super busy when the semester begins, I doubt that there will be many get-togethers, drinking, dinner, whatever. Right now, it's the end of summer, so everyone is just meeting their friends as they head back, but I can imagine these hangouts will be less frequent.

I know the feeling OP. It completely sucks to miss being with friends and being in college, but the outcomes will be better soon. Hope these tips help you :).

It sounds like you are putting a lot of expectation on yourself to manage all these unique and challenging experiences effortlessly (""I still got a B...""), and that is a driving force of your sadness.

Like.. the people chilling with amazing connections from their old money family... maybe that family has been crippled by alcoholism and distrust since their great-great-great-grand-pappy founded a steel-mill on Plymouth Rock. Point is, others' lives are unknowable, and in comparing your own struggle, you pit your known struggle with an imagined non-struggle of others.

My best recommendation I can give to everyone is to find their community (frat/sorority, club, study buddies, or overall, just a friend group). Penn is a large school. There’s over 10,000 of us here. You can find someone who you get along with, and then that one person turns into two, to three, to five, a community.

I’m a Penn student that’s happy.,M2K00,"I feel like while there are happy students at penn--and really, good for you that you're happy--theyre somewhat in the minority. I feel like asking people in person is an even worse way of gauging students happiness because Pennface is a real thing. I'm unhappy at Penn, but I never tell people about that except on Reddit where I can speak freely, making it a surprisingly effective way to gauge opinions. But there are other ways to gauge opinion as well. 

I remember the ""Penn3weeks"" program last year around this time and the majority of the comments were people who couldn't wait to get out of here (myself included). There was a small protest in the comments consisting of people who didn't want to leave, but there weren't as many of them.

 The fact that our school is so forced to at least look at student health (mental and otherwise) and wellness over the last few years says that there is something or somethings about this environment that is not conducive to student wellness and that there is a problem in the student body that warrants immediate action. You don't get a cluster of student suicides and countless other students who have thought about it at a school where most people are happy. 

So to sum up, while they are definitely students who are happy here at Penn, there is a much larger contingence of students who are unhappy for whatever reason.

Edit: I don't say this to scare prospective students from applying. Sometimes these threads do get over-cynical. What I'm attempting to convey is that there are real problems here, like there are at any school, but that shouldn't stop you from applying if you want to; the question you have to ask yourself is whether you're willing to overcome these problems at Penn and work to achieve your goals. So if you want to apply to Penn, don't let one Reddit comment scare you from applying. Take the opinions of others into consideration but realize that ultimately it's a question about yourself more than of the school. If you're up to the challenge and really want to attend despite Penn's issues, then by all means apply. But do so knowing what you're getting yourself into and being ready to face whatever confronts you.",6,,1575371537.0,f9jf0es,False,False,1575371131.0,2019-12-03 05:05:31

Penn can definitely feel lonely because some people immediately find their groups and hit it off right away. Others hate their roommate and struggle to find friends in classes. Making matters worse, class load varies between people and therefore, stress levels. The truth is, if you're applying to an Ivy or any prestigious school for that matter, you know what stress is and you know what stress culture is because that was probably a drop in your high school experience (unless of course, you really didn't have to do much to get in). Penn can definitely be isolating at times, and people can be sad. But people can also be happy, and people's definitions of happiness also vary. The hyper-cynics are probably just trying to actually vent/let some folks know exactly what they're getting into. People are happy, and people are sad.

Sure, the context of one’s environment has an impact on the emotions they feel, but blaming exterior sources for your own stress removes your own actions from the equation. Finding happiness and fulfillment requires personal action and blaming your problems on the culture at Penn rather than considering your own responsibility is dangerous. 

No one should blame their stress purely on themselves, but they should consider that person actions do have different impacts on the emotions they feel. It’s not all the fault of others.

if i see another post about supplementary essays i'm going to yeet myself into the schuylkill,Jae_In,"I'm going to rant:

First of all, just because a student got accepted into Penn doesn't mean he or she got accepted for their essay. I can promise you that NONE of us know ANYTHING about the college acceptance process. We're all just kids, and though we may have some useful comments about grammar or overall essay writing, I am willing to bet my life savings that most of the advice Penn students give on essays is NOT useful. 

Second of all, we have zero interest in reading an essay: we gain nothing and we aren't interested (at least I'm not). The reason why prospective applicants are so willing to read other applicants' essays is their need to self-validate the quality of their own essays. This process of asking for and giving help on essays is purely a self-satisfactory cycle. If you want legitimate help on your essay, go talk to someone who cares about you--not some stranger whom you hope will for some reason read your essay.

Third of all, these posts are not want I want to see on the Penn subreddit. I joined this community so I could read about Penn students' experiences with professors, classes, programs, or majors. I want to be able to read about students' preferences on their favorite food truck, or restaurants near Penn or in Philly. Some sweaty high school senior posting about their essay is fine--what triggers me is that there are millions of identical posts.

There are patients (young ones) who are losing their sense of taste and smell weeks after recovering. Some young patients are developing stroke. I'm not saying this happens to many or even a material number of young people. But why would you voluntarily risk this? Maybe I'm just scared but I know I wouldn't want to subject myself to this. Even young healthy people who have contracted the virus are reporting that it's basically the worst flu they've ever gotten on top of the issues they have breathing. It's not fun. At all. And my grades would plummet because of it as well. 

And unfortunately like someone mentioned, we interact with so many more people than just students.

Putting so many young people in close proximity is not helping public health in Philly. 

That said, I'm not critisizing any decision. It's a tough call either way. But I do wish Penn would provide more flexibility to students who prefer to stay at home. I'm basically being forced back onto campus because housing told me that if I don't live on campus on the fall, they're taking away my housing assignment and that I likely would not be able to succesfully re-apply for housing in the spring. So I'm stuck with making the choice of saving a sizeable amount of money from housing/dining as well as removing myself from a high risk environment, and screwing up my spring semester because I won't be able to find housing.

Day 1 we started learning taylor series (what most people think is the hardest part of a second semester calculus course, and which is typically taught last) , we were expected to learn everything about that in a week, and week 2 we moved on to big O notation. It’s kind of hard to conceptually grasp and Rimmer + some TAs/tutors are completely unfamiliar with it from what ive been hearing

My main problem is we’ve barely had any time with the material and we have our first quiz next week. The prep quizzes (basically homework) take me hours to complete even tho theyre at most 4 problems. I havent had time to study for any other class. Part of this is me having inefficient study techniques as im still adjusting to college (im a freshman). 

I feel like i can crack the material with time, but time is something i dont have. Thats my grievance with math 104 rn. Its brutal.

Edit: I realize this might not be the reply u asked for. We’re assigned ghrists videos for this class, but his vids were made for the engineering section of 104, which contains things we dont have to know.

Do you think SFS will include housing in our plan if we were to move out of our current homes, but not live in Philadelphia?

So basically, assuming most classes are online (also that no one is required to be on-campus physically ), would we still receive aid if we choose to be ""off-campus"" but in another city/state? For any of the following reasons:

* because home environment is not conducive to learning
* leases will be a nightmare

At home, would you behave in a manner that might place your loved ones, parents etc. more at risk (be honest).   Is it perhaps better for college students to interact mostly with each-other with the obvious additional restrictions (which restrictions you would probably have anyway wherever you are) and where you can be regularly tested, and isolated for 2 weeks if you are positive?  The hybrid choice (and it is a choice as between that, online or no college this semester) is a better option than not doing anything or learning online.  However, it is reasonable to conclude that you would rather wait until things are back to normal before you go back to or start school.  But, make sure you know your alternatives and have something meaningful to do.  9 months of nothing just is not the way to go.

Fall Semester Planning | Penn Fall Semester 2020 Planning,InternationalCupcake,"At least you admit it.

So, to summarize: in a thread discussing the public health consequences of Penn's decision to bring students back to campus, you are comfortable with the exchange of 20-30 human lives in exchange for your ability to have a hybrid on-campus semester in college.

When called out on that, you falsely equate car crashes and global warming with infectious diseases, and attempt some frankly weak-ass edgelord trolling to boot.

In addition to my submat in MCIT at Penn, I work here in the School of Medicine, Department of Family Medicine. Our patient population is almost entirely disadvantaged people in West Philly. I see the effects that run-of-the-mill health disparities have on our patients, and I see what COVID is doing to them. I see the West Philly residents who are low paid workers that clean the toilets and serve the food. I see the docs and CRNPs and midwives and medical support staff working nights and weekends to spin up testing tents and ensure patients have the access they need, regardless of insurance or cost. And I see the people that will die thanks to the ignorant, anti-science, selfish pieces of shit that will choose personal liberty over collective safety, as long as it isn't THEIR safety that is at risk.

Ultimately, the sad thing about your ""perspective"" is that you are not special and you are not alone. There's some fraction of the student population who agrees that there is an acceptable level of preventable death (of course, not your own death or those of your friends or family) that can be traded for...what? A half-assed, half-semester of hybrid on-campus college. It's exactly that population that will defy safety regulations and congregate off-campus for parties and whatnot without precautions, and will end up getting people killed.

To be honest, u/Praesto_Omnibus, I though I could write you off as a weak little troll child. But then I looked at your user history, and the amount of LSD you are clearly doing suggests to me that you may have rotted your brain to the point where you actually believe this shit. So I can't write you off. I will just say this instead: I hope that your Penn education leads you to a place where you can grow into a moral human being, reconcile the choices you are making during the global pandemic of 2020-2021, and not stay up at night thinking of the people your selfish actions will inevitably devastate.

I think your relationship with risk is silly. A normal semester causes preventable deaths in pre-covid times. So if you're fine with a normal semester pre-covid, then you agree that there is an acceptable level of preventable death for an experience that's not purely online. That's the only point I care about making here. 

And also I stand by my analogy with car crashes and global warming because a death is a death whether it's to a natural disaster, a disease, or a car accident. The fact that disease spreads person to person is irrelevant to the point that I was making.

Anyone else scared for their future?,Ninjaboi333,"So I'm W'14 out here in the ""real world"" and the number one lesson I learned at Penn was this 

Everything happens for a reason, everything turns out for the better. We just don't always realize how or why at the time. 

At Penn I came in wanting to do finance but between doing poorly in my early classes + some finance related extracurriculars, I eventually found a love for the tech space where I work now

I applied and ran for positions in student orgs I really wanted junior year, ended up not getting them. I then had the free time to do things with other orgs that ultimately led me to fundraising a lot of money in response to a natural disaster that I would not have been able to pull off otherwise. 

I had two internships in tech, one being at Google somehow. Neither of them converted to a return offer (either from the sophomore internship to return junior year, or for a full time offer to return after graduation). I graduated with a sub 3.0 GPA (actually had to request makeup work from one professor for my global requirement because I had burned out hard second sem senior year to the point I barely made it to classes) without any job offers from the companies I had applied to both OCR or on my own or through career services. 

I eventually found a job here in NYC in tech after a month of cold applying (literally on the back of being a Penn grad, as told to me by the recruiter I talked to) and moved up here. In the past 6+ years since graduating I've been hired and let go by 3 different jobs in tech, for various reasons. But I've always been able to happen into my next gig by being at the right place at the right time within a few months of looking. Two of them I found through scrolling on reddit of all places and I've truly enjoyed and grown from each role I've had - they were all what I needed at that time in my life. 

Now I'm more or less freelancing within my industry and I couldn't be happier with the flexibility and whatnot I'm not afforded. I'm producing podcasts for fun and for pay which wasn't even on my radar at all back in college. 

The point being of this long and winding story is that setbacks can and will happen. Obviously you current students now are dealing with a global setback on a scale we've rarely seen in recent history. I've met alum who graduated in the middle of the 08 financial crisis. And they're all doing just fine, if not thriving. You guys made it to Penn which is in itself no small feat. It can be easy to feel discouraged by your classmates who seemingly have their life on track. But A) I'm sure there are high school friends and others who look to you and feel the same way because you're at an Ivy League school and B) Life has no track. It is what we make of it - our end result is a mix of chance and hard work. If I had stayed on track with what I thought I was going to do Freshmen year, I'd be completely miserable in a Wall Street Investment Banking gig completely burnt out and creatively bankrupt and cynical. Because I didn't end up at Google or other bit Silicon Valley tech companies I avoided getting stuck in a big corporate structure (which through my other jobs I've discovered that the smaller the team the happier I am). I wouldn't be having amazing conversations with guests who I interview for my podcast and feeling the independence and flexibility that comes with freelancing (where granted many of my contacts and knowledge come from time spent in those jobs I ended up parting with).

Anyone else scared for their future?,maspie_den,"First, realize that so many young adults in your position are feeling the same way right now. Even without the complexity of COVID, thinking ahead to the future can be very anxiety-inducing. Take a look at the resumes/LinkedIns of people who work in your desired field. What experience do they have that you're maybe missing? What can you do to bridge any gaps? Take a MasterClass, get an off-campus job during the school year (if you can), network. Take this unique moment as an opportunity to build and develop yourself professionally and personally, so you never look back on this time and think, ""Shit, I had all the time but didn't do anything with it.""   


By the way, there are plenty of ""grown-ups"" out there who still don't know what they want to do! Sometimes the path isn't always a pipeline and you might come to great opportunities in a round-about way.

If you have some sort of idea of what interests you, maybe try to get an “exploration” internship. If you don’t, look for internships that are general but that look appealing to you. Some people fall into a random field and love it.

I know it’s hard right now with covid. But don’t worry. We’re all in the same boat and we just have to keep on keeping on. Best of luck and just remember that it’s okay to be a little worried about the future! No shame in it at all.",4,,False,g2ay7zt,False,False,1597993970.0,2020-08-21 02:12:50

Anything and Everything about Penn Alumni Interviews! [ED/QB Fall 2019 Edition],FightingQuaker17,"#BEFORE ASKING A QUESTION, READ THE TEXT ABOVE, THE COMMENTS BELOW, THIS FAQ, AND PREVIOUS THREADS

It's very likely that your question has already been asked/answered.

**Q: How important are interviews?**

> Depends on who you ask. Penn itself claims that interviews are very important:
 
> *[""Yes. Time and again, Admissions Officers tell us how helpful the interview report is as they evaluate applicants. In addition, applicants say the interview strengthened their perception of the university, and increased their desire to attend Penn.""](https://www.alumni.upenn.edu/s/1587/gid2/16/interior.aspx?sid=1587&gid=2&pgid=6200#panel4)*

> Most alumni/current students though disagree and believe that interviews will likely not be a deciding factor on whether or not an applicant gets in. I'm in this camp too--I think Penn uses interviews more as a way to convince accepted applicants to enroll, but again, I don't know anything. This isn't a reason to not care about your interview, but hopefully should decrease any stress about it.

**Q: What do interviews know about me?**

> We are given your name, the high school you attend, the city where you live, contact information, and the school you applied to. We do not get anything else, including test scores etc. You do not need to bring a resume to your interview (in fact, Penn tells you not to). 

**Q: How does the interview process work?**
> If you get an interview, sometime between now and the end of February, an alumni will send you an email asking you for an interview. They likely will give you a couple of time slots and suggest a location (it should be a public location and should not be in your house or their house--call admissions ASAP if your interviewer is a creep). Then you and the alumni will negotiate a time and place. The interview typically lasts between 20-45 minutes. 


**Q: Am I at a disadvantage if I don't get an interview?**
> No. Penn tries to get everyone an interview, but sometimes this is not possible due to alumni availability. Not getting an interview has EVERYTHING to do with alumni availability and NOTHING to do with the quality of your application. Those volunteers that tell alumni to interview people don't see your test scores either (see question above). So if you don't get an interview, don't freak out. Penn does not count it against you and there are plenty of people who were accepted even though they did not get an interview. However, this does not apply if you are granted an interview and you decline without a good reason (i.e., not ""I don't want to"")

**Q: OMG Someone in a school got an interview a month ago and I'm still waiting, does this mean I'm going to get rejected?**

> No. Read question above--your application was either assigned to an alumni that is working through a list, assigned to a different alumni than your colleague, or not assigned to anyone yet. It's entirely random (though may have something to do with when you turned in your application given that I received an assignment today and apps are due tomorrow).

**Q: Okay I asked the same question above and its been a week and still nothing, should I be worried?**
> No. Someone else getting an interview and you not getting one has no bearing on the quality of either of your applications. Those that decide who gets assigned an interview first and those that don't do not see you application details whatsoever. NOT getting an interview does not mean you can't get in. GETTING an interview does not mean you have a better chance of getting in.

**Q: Still haven't heard anything. Should I be concerned?**
> No. <3

**Q: What questions will my interviewer ask?**
> See the main text in the post above, where I copy and pasted the suggested questions Penn gives alumni volunteers. Note that some alumni ignore these questions altogether and ask other questions that may be more tied to the program you applied to. Hopefully you don't get a moron that asks for your test scores and irrelevant shit, but it happens. I typically start with some basic questions and let the conversation flow from there. In our report, alumni are asked to answer these questions: 

>*What are the student’s academic pursuits and interests? Why?*

>*What are the student’s activities or passions outside of class? Why?*

>*Why has the student decided to apply to Penn?*

>*Is there anything of note, contextual details in particular, that the Admissions office should know about this student?* (I usually leave this blank)

>*What is your bottom-line impression of the student and their potential fit for Penn?*

>(There's also a specific rating scale, something like ""Not a good fit"" all the way up to ""The Best I've Ever Interviewed"")",1,moderator,1577840277.0,fcoqik7,True,True,1577838870.0,2019-12-31 18:34:30

This comment from this thread specifically says that most questions came from the Penn Alumni website, which are the same questions that I posted in the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9xyhli/penn_mt_interview/ea1x11p/

For context, here's how interviews work. Every region has interview coordinators, whose job is to notify alumni volunteers that they have been assigned an interview. Alumni volunteers note how many interviews they would like to do (for example, I say three per application cycle). The coordinators use this info to try and match applicants to interviewers based on availability and fit (school to school). I usually get matched up with people in the College, but at times I've had people from other schools too. 

You not getting an interview and someone else getting theirs soon can happen for multiple reasons. Perhaps you were assigned with someone who only wanted to do a few interviews but was assigned many. Perhaps you were assigned to someone who likes to space out their interviews and may have saved you towards the end of the interview cycle. Perhaps you haven't been assigned anyone yet because all volunteers have had their quota met, and you are one of the odd ones out that they may try to assign during the ""superhero"" part of the cycle (towards the end where they recruit volunteers from all over the country to do phone/video interviews with applicants). 

Either way, I see zero reason to change what I first told you:

Getting or not getting an interview has everything to do with available volunteers and nothing to do with quality of the application.


Also, not getting an interview will have no bearing on whether or not you get in. Hoping you get one, and there is still time, but I suggest chilling about it as there is zero reason to worry about this (and there are so many stresses during senior year as is). A good interview will not get you in, and if you are rejected, it won't be because you didn't have an interview.",2,,False,f8d9d4u,True,False,1574482334.0,2019-11-22 22:12:14

making friends in college can always be intimidating. For me it was, I was terrified of being lonely and not fitting in. However :  


1. It is going to be easier than you think. You are not alone and a lot of people feel the same way before going to college.
2. The best thing you can do is to participate. When I went to college I avoided a bit too much social events and that hindered my social life a bit. Since no one really knows anybody there, being in the room sis kind of 80% of the work.  As days go by you'll see how your social circle shapes itself.

Some positive news in these days; Penn is a leader in new vaccine trials,Temper03,"For those unable to read the article, here's the relevant section about Penn:

""**Phase I candidates: Safety testing begins on two other genetic vaccines**

Other vaccine efforts \[*other than Oxford's vaccine group*\] are also showing early promise. On Monday, 15 healthy volunteers in New York received the first doses of an mRNA-based vaccine similar to Moderna’s, called BNT162. Produced by Pfizer and a German pharma company called BioNTech, BNT162 is one of four genetic vaccine candidates the two companies are jointly developing to fight SARS-CoV-2. Over the next few weeks, the Phase I trial will enroll 360 people in four different research hospitals to see how safe these different variations are compared to a placebo.

Researchers will monitor patients for the next two years, looking for signs of side effects as well as any antibodies their bodies produce against SARS-CoV-2. But since most bad reactions happen right away, the scientists should know in three to four months if the vaccine candidates are safe. They’ll also have an idea of which one of the four works best. That’s the one they’ll move into a larger study with more people, which could happen as soon as this fall, says Mark J. Mulligan, director of the Vaccine Center at NYU Langone Health. Mulligan is leading the NYU Langone Tisch Hospital trial site. “We’re doing in months what typically takes years,” he says.

A few hours away, at the **University of Pennsylvania**, researchers are also testing the safety of another genetic vaccine, produced by the nearby biotech company Inovio. Codenamed INO-4800, the vaccine is made out of synthetic DNA instead of RNA, though the principle is the same. Packaged into the DNA is a section of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Inovio is testing two doses of INO-4800 in 40 healthy volunteers split between UPenn and the Center for Pharmaceutical Research in Kansas City, Missouri.

Because it’s a bit tricker to get DNA into cells, doctors have to deliver a tiny electrical impulse following the injection. That little jolt opens the pores of the cell membranes, allowing the DNA to slip inside. The first volunteer for this Phase I trial received the shot and subsequent zap on April 6. Though the other 39 participants have now also received at least the first dose, it will take another few weeks for everyone in the study to hit the point where you’d expect to start seeing a surge in antibodies, says Pablo Tebas, an infectious disease doctor at UPenn and the trial’s principal investigator.

But the researchers and Inovio are already starting to plan a Phase II trial for later this summer that would primarily enroll doctors, nurses, police officers, and other essential workers with [a high chance of Covid-19 exposure](https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-covid-19-healthcare-risks-equipment/). “Traditionally, these would not be done in parallel,” says Tebas. “But all the prevailing ideas about taking the time to do them in sequence have gone by the wayside with this epidemic. Making antibodies is one thing, but we really need to know if those antibodies protect you from infection.”

In addition to these vaccine candidates, there are also two others currently in human trials in China. Both are chemically inactivated versions of the virus, one developed by Sinovac and one developed at the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. According to [a list](https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf) assembled by the World Health Organization, there are a further 71 vaccine candidates that could soon follow.""",6,,False,fqmx0iv,True,False,1589484938.0,2020-05-14 14:35:38

Feeling Overwhelmed,HughGrantCirca1994,"Hey friend! Regardless of background or situation, freshmen year is hard for everyone! Don't for a second believe that your peers are holding it together. Literally everyone is a mess those first few months.

Some things to keep in mind:

1. Focus on you. Just you. If you did better today than you did yesterday, you're moving in the right direction. Never think of your achievements in comparison with those of others. 
2. Reach out for help! Pride is hard to swallow, and if you're at Penn now it probably means that you excelled in academics while in high school, so falling behind now is making you question yourself and you probably feel anxious, but instead of turning all that inwards and shutting down, realize that the Penn is literally flooded with people who want to see you succeed. Your professors, TAs, friends, counselors, no one wants to see you fail, so ask for help! Professors and TAs, that's like literally their job, to teach you. Don't be afraid to email them. Your friends are probably struggling with the same materials too, so try study groups! There are also so many resources like the Weingarten center that will help you figure out time-management, or just getting a tutor in general (ask around for how that works, I'm sure covid changed it up). 
3. Clubs and organizations will always be there. Freshman year is hard enough on its own sometimes, so maybe choose one or two things you're interested in, but take this year to really just focus on settling in. Then maybe next semester, or next year, when you're less overwhelmed, you could reach out to more clubs!

Lastly I'll just say, no assignment, no test, no quiz, is as important as your well being. Take moments, many moments, to just breathe and maybe do something that you enjoy. Binge TV on a Wednesday, go biking, play Among Us, read a book for fun. At the end of the day, you are doing this for you, so be kind to yourself.",25,,False,g6bmg6y,False,False,1600872737.0,2020-09-23 09:52:17

Do not worry at all! Zoom fatigue is a real thing. It's really hard to keep your energy up when you spend the majority of your day staring at a screen. And freshman year is hard even when we aren't all living through a pandemic. Keep your head up.

Also, if clubs are stressing you out, don't be obligated to participate! I always say that clubs should be a source of relaxation/study breaks rather than an added source of stress. Some of the joys of freshman year are applying to all clubs and then slowly weeding out the clubs until only the ones you like are left. It's okay to quit things in college!

And finally, to echo what other people have said already, mental health comes first! College is so much more than a number on an assignment. There are plenty of opportunities to make up one bad quiz grade. And in the grand scheme of things, as long as you are learning something from the experience, a failed quiz isn't a complete loss!

Feeling Overwhelmed,orzy-,"Hiya! Penn grad student/TA here. Ive seen a lot of this happening with my students both past and present as well as my boyfriend (who doesn’t go to Penn). I also had the same issue at the finish of last semester with my own classes. 

We are going through an unprecedented time in history. You did not sign up to get a virtual education. But you’re sticking with it and staying strong (that’s an accomplishment in itself!!). Try to minimize stuff outside of coursework your first and maybe even second semester, especially now. No doubt, things seem to take a lot longer with online education, even for me. I found that a lot of it came from the fact that I could pause my lectures and take super descriptive notes, etc. I’ve been watching my boyfriend work on his class stuff since 11 AM and he’s still got hours more to go. 

I highly recommend setting a schedule for yourself. Try and emulate what you would regularly do. Even better, try and compartmentalize your space so you do school work in one area, eat in another, socialize online in another. Set limits on how long you will work continuously and take regular breaks. Set a school curfew for yourself. You’ll feel a lot more in control if you strictly schedule school versus relaxation time. And really, if you have the space, try and set up a “school area”. 

First year is a really hard time & I can online imagine how challenging it must be without the true social aspect. But you and the others in this thread should applaud yourself for any of the work you’re getting done, especially given the PANDEMIC (!!!) were working through. 

Hang in there & reach out if you’re struggling. If you have professors who are being less than accommodating REPORT them. This includes overly aggressive surveillance techniques in Zoom to mitigate “cheating”.",3,,False,g6ddr56,False,False,1600905893.0,2020-09-23 19:04:53

F*ck Penn,pennbio,"According to current research and all the data, healthy students our age aren’t at any significant risk to die or have serious illness. It has to do with the way our immune system functions and what aspects of our immune response are best at neutralizing the virus. Like we’ve seen diminishing levels of antibodies in people who were infected while also seeing higher levels of cd8 T cells (responsible for directly neutralizing the disease) in mild/asymptomatic cases and lower levels of severe illness [[1]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20148429v1) [[2]](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.21.20132449v1). Because younger people have extremely robust T cell immune responses and lower antibody levels, we neutralize the virus far better. This pathophysiology supports extremely low mortality rates for young people [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm). Another thing to not with the cfr of young people is that it’s likely disproportionately higher than that of old people because of a much smaller percentage of serious illness because of the described factors. And also keep in mind the ifr across age groups is likely around .6% [[4]](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01738-2) [[5]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html). So no, the risk was never to us. We’d be fine. The risk is to people outside of the penn student student body. Sure, students with underlying health conditions would be at risk, but they’d probably stay home anyway.

Edit: just saw the second part of your comment. No im not out of my mind. I just keep up on current literature more than most people do because I’m naturally interested in this stuff.",-5,,False,g14sark,False,False,1597173840.0,2020-08-11 14:24:00

Revision to Fall Semester Plans
Regarding On-Campus Housing, Tuition and Fees

A Message to the Penn Community
from
Amy Gutmann, President
Wendell Pritchett, Provost
Craig Carnaroli, Executive Vice President
J. Larry Jameson, Dean, Perelman School of Medicine and
Executive VP University of Pennsylvania for the Health System

We write today with an enormous sense of sadness. It had been our fervent hope since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic that public health measures and an increased availability of testing would allow us to offer our undergraduates a hybrid learning experience this fall that, by including more remote learning, social distancing and other safety precautions, would enable all the students who desired it the opportunity to live and learn on campus.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 continues to spread at an alarming rate across the country, with approximately 2 million new cases reported over just the past month. The progression of the disease is evident in many states from which Penn welcomes thousands of students. The sheer number of students who by Pennsylvania public health recommendation would now upon arrival—or based upon testing or high-risk exposure—need to go into a two-week quarantine is untenable. At the same time, supply chain issues have more severely limited the availability and the turn-around time of COVID testing than medical experts foresaw. Since we last communicated we learned that our planned pre-testing regimen would not be possible. The combination of these factors radically constrains our ability to provide a safe and meaningful on-campus experience for our undergraduates.

Thus, based on the advice of the leading health experts at Penn Medicine and on current public health restrictions, with the full support of the Penn Board of Trustees, we must share the deeply disappointing news that with only very limited exceptions for international students and those students dealing with significant housing or personal hardships, we will not be able to accommodate undergraduate students in University housing. Students who need to apply for on-campus housing exceptions can do so at My Home at Penn.

As we have previously announced, the vast majority of instruction for undergraduate students will be online, with very limited exceptions (clinical experiences in Nursing, and classes in other undergraduate schools that are essential for students to meet their curricular or pedagogical requirements). Graduate and professional programs will continue to evaluate their own operations.

It is important to note that with the limited exception of this required in-person instruction, there will be no physical on-campus activities in the fall semester. For the safety of students and the broader community, we are encouraging all other students not to return to Philadelphia.

Our world-class faculty are preparing an outstanding array of engaging online courses, ensuring that the University continues to provide a meaningful and high-quality education to all our students. Faculty have been busy this summer designing new recordings, interactive elements for their students and working with their schools in state-of-the-art classroom studios. In addition, University Life and the Office of Student Affairs, the Center for Undergraduate Research, and College Houses have designed new ways for student groups and cohorts to connect online, to hold virtual performances, to present and attend academic poster sessions and fairs and to gather virtually. Some of these have already begun, with the largest ever Pre-Freshman Program currently underway. Every incoming undergraduate will participate in the launch of our online New Student Orientation, which will include year-long cohort activities this year around the theme of Civic Engagement. New Student Orientation will culminate in a virtual Convocation on August 31st.

While we have great confidence in the high quality of this educational and college life experience, we deeply regret that these changes represent a significant disappointment to families and students. We have stressed in all of our previous messages that our decisions for the fall would be guided by the most current medical information and governmental directives, and that our plans would need to be flexible and could change depending on the progression of the pandemic. For everyone’s safety, it is imperative to take the steps we are announcing today.

Despite the escalating costs of providing a safe and meaningful educational program, we recognize and appreciate the financial challenges incurred by many students in our community as a result of the pandemic. As a result, we have determined to make tuition and fee adjustments for the fall semester. Tuition for the fall semester will be rolled back by 3.9%, thus freezing tuition at last year’s rate, and the General Fee will be reduced for the fall semester by 10%. Housing and dining fees that have been paid by students will be credited or refunded in full, consistent with the methodology used in the Spring. Student financial aid budgets for tuition and general fees will remain at current levels, despite the decrease in cost to students, and students remaining at home will still receive aid for food commensurate with our off-campus dining rate. The University has made significant increases in our financial aid budget to assist students and families in this difficult time and we will continue to make emergency assistance available to support all students who need it.

Since March, when we made the difficult but necessary decision to depopulate the campus, faculty and staff from across the University have worked tirelessly to prepare our campus to welcome students this fall. We continue to hope that we will be able to welcome students back for the spring semester, and will do everything in our power to maximize that possibility.

All of us at Penn are deeply grateful for the patience that families and students have shown as we have navigated the rapidly changing landscape of this evolving global crisis. We sincerely believe that the educational experience that students will receive this fall will be among the finest available in the world. We will do all that we can to keep each class involved and connected virtually, so that they can continue to interact and share their Penn experience with classmates in a safe and productive way.

We know that there will be many questions that arise because of the changes we are announcing today. We have prepared an FAQ that should be helpful in providing more detailed information. If you have questions that are not answered in the FAQ, you can email coronavirus@upenn.edu. 

We thank you for your ongoing understanding and support of the University of Pennsylvania. This has been an extraordinarily challenging year, which has solidified so clearly the invaluable spirit and solidarity of our Penn family. Please know that the University is committed to your safety and well-being, and to providing a truly world-class educational experience. As we have promised before, we will keep you posted on any additional changes as we progress into the semester.

RIP Senior Year,pennbio,"A couple reasons. Moderna just released phase two results of their vaccine, demonstrating stimulation of antibody production in all of the trials members. Side effects for the medium dose, the one they’re going forward with in phase 3, included fatigue, pain at injection site, and other very mild side effects. They’re starting phase 3 with 30k participants on July 27 and expect to have a few hundred million doses by 2021. Fauci recently called this candidate “really quite promising.”

Oxford/AstraZeneca is the other leading contender, which has been in phase 2/3 (a hybrid trial system designed to speed up the approval process) for a while now with the phase 3 part starting in Brazil on June 20th. Back in May, AstraZeneca inked a $1.2 billion deal with the US to supply around 300 million doses by the end of 2020. Oxford plans to have a study with preliminary data  published in The Lancet on July 20 and more substantive data from current phases released in August/September. They’ve even announced they’ll roll out a few million doses as early as September to the UK. 

As for cost, I don’t think Moderna has said anything (american pharma company so...), but Astra Zeneca has announced they won’t profit and will sell vaccines for $2.80 in the EU. We can expect a similar cost in the US though it hasn’t been announced yet. 

As an addendum, there’s one company, CanSino Bio, which has a produced a vaccine currently being used in the Chinese Military after phase 2 results showed it produced a strong immune response.

Social media is toxic as hell, esp in quarantine. My mental health got a lot better when I deleted snapchat, facebook, and instagram and focused on actually connecting with people I like. Ignore the social stuff and just focus on yourself and chilling for right now - you'll be happier and better for it, and still have plenty of time for growing your social life after the pandemic has settled

Freshman Feeling FOMO and Loneliness,Housesize3,"it's true that social media makes fomo a lot easier but two points i want to push back on a bit:

1. ""it'll all be fine once we're back"" --> by now i think it's safe to say that any sort of recovery is going to be slow and maybe steady and take a LONG time to happen. It's really unlikely that one day it'll be busted and the next day everything will come back together. Any game plan that's actually workable has to work even if there's no clear sign of a reliable, mass-produce-able, mass-distribute-able vaccine for a long time (I don't wanna put out exact numbers but it's entirely possible we don't get anything that works in 2021. unfortunately research is not like homework where there's a clear stopping point)

2. which leads to the thing about making friends online, which is very different from social media ""friendships"". I actually do agree with the scare-quotes since a lot of these relationships are built on unstable foundations, but i wouldn't write off online friendships altogether. It's a powerful double-edged sword and most people are bad at it because most people haven't thought enough about how good relationships work, but I personally wouldn't blanket-discourage anyone from trying.",3,,False,g4gmcgx,False,False,1599587105.0,2020-09-08 12:45:05

1. I was a weirdo who decided to do my  honors thesis junior year, and my thesis defense winded up being on the morning of Hey Day. I was super nervous before my presentation, but a few seconds after I started, my PI, who was also my professor that semester, walked in to listen. It was extremely rewarding to present in front of her and 2 professors whose classes I would take my senior fall. After I was done, it was only 9 AM; a ran back to the high rises gleeful, grateful, on a natural high; changed, took some shots, and then marched down Locust Walk with the class of 2019! I took dozens of pictures with all the friends I had made, including one of my favorites with my freshman hall mates. It was the best day of that year, by far.
2. My senior year NSO, my a capella group was rehearsing in Houston Hall for a freshman event. The University Chaplain, Charles Howard, happened to hear us because the rehearsal room is right next to the office for Religious Life. Apparently he listened to us sing the whole time, and it was arguably one of our best performances of that song. He was brought to tears!

In short, the leadership @ Wharton have negotiating leverage that the leadership @ CAS does not. And they use that leverage, in part, to ensure the ongoing exclusivity and ""brand"" of Wharton. Because capitalism is all real-politik nonsense, this is considered ""value-added"".

This means that if someone says they're concentrating in stats, finance, etc., they've taken 4 classes on finance. Hardly makes them an expert. 

If a ""concentration"" only requires 4 classes, what would a ""minor"" look like? 2 classes? It would look kind of bad for Wharton to be handing out minors left and right like that.

A good alternative is to just take the class if you're interested and write about it in a cover letter or resume.",5,,False,g0ii2lt,False,False,1596678597.0,2020-08-05 20:49:57

I know many wharton upperclassmen who couldn't get into basic classes like management 101 or finance 203. I'd imagine if a finance minor were created, a ton of people would have a strong interest in it. 

To have the same small class sizes would be infeasible unless dozens of more professors were hired. Apart from CIS, there isn't crazy demand for other minors relatively speaking.

Different university, but there was a rumor spread that I had tried to kill myself while on faculty at a large university. Lots of friends and colleagues around all the time during that period and almost no one even brought the rumors to my attention. 

There were a few “are you do Ok’s” in passing, but the number of people ( that I found out later) that had heard about the rumor and talked about it with other students and faculty members was  mind boggling. 

I didn’t try to kill myself... but if I had, I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I would have succeeded the second time around due to the gossip and looks I received. Felt, and still kinda feel less than a whole person because of it all. 

I’ve been guilty of gossip and water cooler talk in the past ( nothing malicious, just the typical “did you hear” stuff m) but I never considered just how damaging  it could be to a person.

That is why everyone was concerned and confused, since it was unclear whether it actually included Penn Med or Engineering. And now some individual programs are saying they can take some students.

Found this at the University of Houston,NewLoseIt,"Did a little bit of digging on some interesting parts of the paper:

&#x200B;

""**The Moore School of Electrical Engineering**"" used to be an independent school of Penn, from 1923 until an unspecified date where it was rolled into the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS).  It was at what's now the Moore School Building at 33rd and Walnut.  It was the birthplace of the first computer (ENIAC), the first computer course (in 1946), and the first computer company (Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, which was founded in 1946 and sold ENIAC-type computers to the government and companies).  The successor to that company is Unisys, which is a multi-billion dollar IT company based out in Montgomery County PA.

&#x200B;

The ""**Growing Machine**"" mentioned on Question 2b was a little harder to track down (I kept finding results for cannabis growing machines or growth in machine learning...) but it looks like it's a reference to the machines developed by **Dr. John Carr at Penn**, who improved on the ""von Neumann"" or ""Princeton Architecture"" of computer design.  Basically, it looks like Dr. Carr theorized that, unlike the standard divide between Hardware and Software, if you had a generalized Hardware machine, you could keep adding Software machines to it, as long as you had extra space, to ""grow"" the machine's functionality in whatever ways you could imagine --- which you see today with how smartphones are hardware machines which actually change function based on the software (apps) they download.

&#x200B;

Something really wild I found relevant to myself:  Dr. John Carr later taught the first Computer course at **U. Michigan's** engineering department (where I studied undergraduate computer engineering) and brought the first computer to China at **Shanghai Jiaotong University** (where I studied computer engineering during an exchange semester).

>Dr. John Weber Carr, III, professor emeritus of computer and information science, died on April 8 at the age of 73.  
>  
>From 1953-57, he was an associate professor at Michigan--teaching the first computer applications courses there--and supervised operations and software of MIDAC at Michigan's Willow Run Research Center. At the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill from 1957 to 1962, he was professor of mathematics and director of the Research Computation Center.  
>  
>In 1963 he came to Penn, where he was to teach and research programming languages, problem solving, learning theories and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design. The multilingual Dr. Carr was a visiting professor at the Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam and at the University of Sydney, and lectured in the Soviet Union and China, becoming adjunct professor of computer science at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai. **He took the first personal computer to China**, and later in his career he installed the computer laboratory and curriculum for the Egyptian Air Force Academy. Dr. Carr was named emeritus professor in 1993.

Petition for lowering tuition,tacticalnookincoming,"Why would they still have to pay for buildings as much as they did during normal term? Many of the buildings/parts of buildings won’t be in use as much due to the cut in in person classes. Athletic facilities will not be in use during the fall. I don’t imagine the auditoriums will all be used for small classes. They’re also shutting down all in person classes from Nov 20 through year-end, surely the buildings can take a break in terms of energy/upkeep during that time.

At the very least the university must understand that many parents and students think it absurd for us to pay full price when we can’t access the same resources, such as if we are at home or even if we’re on campus. For example, although the libraries are opening, during the spring term my family and I were upset because the resources I usually use (rare books/manuscripts center and Huntsman Hall computer stations) were entirely inaccessible. Part of the reason I came to Penn was for these resources - it is why I picked to go here over another university - and truly I am not getting my money’s worth when these resources are shut down.

While obviously Penn wouldn't contribute a large chunk of their endowment to paying off people's tuition for invesmtent reasons and common sense (them having to provide other relief due to covid), let's assume that only 5% of this is liquid.

Most Ivies only offer degrees under Arts and Science and sometimes a separate engineering school. A CAS econ degree at Penn is comparable to any undergraduate degree at other Ivies so placement wise it is still top-notch. Just because somebody does not study applied economics and business does not mean they are less likely to work in finance roles and looking at CAS's econ major and other relevant major's placement into finance and consulting will convince you that placement wise, a college degree majoring in econ is above many of those in the ivy league.  The difference between the CAS degree and the Wharton degree in terms of placement is the difference between the best placement into business roles and a standard Ivy league level placement into business roles.  The difference is not that big, and you can see the isolated salary data for college econ grads is around a 75K base salary, according to College Scoreboard. In contrast, a Wharton grad is around an 80K base salary.  If you delve deeper into the college scoreboard data, you will see that the average econ grad from the college outearns more than half of those within Wharton.

At the end of the day, people will always have a lot to say about the wealthy people and FGLI people. What I will say is this: at Penn, there will always be pressure to spend more. I was heavily aided, but definitely not fully aided. I did not come from a family where joining a sorority would make any sort of financial sense, nor dumping money on downtowns. I did pay for ubers into the city for BYOs, and I helped paid for alcohol as an upperclassman; I had a work study job all four years to ensure my parents did not pay for these things. I paid for a lot of off campus meals, and I still had friends who didn't feel as comfortable, and yes, it did cause friction sometimes. But at the end of the day, I felt that the people I met at Penn were pretty cognizant of financial disparities among classmates, and always fully understood why I did or did not participate in certain parts of campus life. I never felt uncomfortable. But FGLI students definitely do, and so thats why we're always talking about it, and trying to work towards creating the most understanding and accommodating student body/campus life possible.",25,,False,fo5mwxk,False,False,1587529707.0,2020-04-21 23:28:27

I think rural is seen as simply geographic... some folks from rural areas are highly aided and some are not. So that’s probably why that term isn’t referenced much, just my guess. The middle class view is very limited, but I would argue that FGLI groups are more accepting if you feel you need to discuss issues/find support! It’s hard to define the groups really... I know some students who are middle class but their parents pay for all their expenses such that they don’t work, won’t have loans, etc. Certainly not in the 1%, but it would be hard to fit into conversations with students who work multiple jobs and skip meals to get by. However, tons of middle class students, for example, have jobs to support themselves at least partially, tremendous debt looming, and a lot of questions/social confusion to navigate at a place like Penn! In those cases, I would say reaching out to FGLI students/groups and being candid about your situation could be helpful.",9,,1587527295.0,fo5j4md,False,False,1587526903.0,2020-04-21 22:41:43

There is a decent number of upper middle class kids from rich areas with elite public schools, but I always struggled to find peers from typical rural or small town communities and average schools. I think Penn tends to be risk averse by avoiding unknown schools and communities unless there is some special reason. I felt like I was the odd one out all the time. My high school was nothing like Penn and I definitely could have used some additional preparation for the lifestyle or a more robust community of similar students. I think those of us who exist at Penn tend to be lumped in with one extreme or the other so it is hard to pinpoint where they are. A lot of the issue is probably reinforced by campus culture.

Agreed very much, and although my evidence is anecdotal it certainly seems to me that people from average areas/unknown schools have to have much more accomplishment and higher scores to get to the same place. Meanwhile Penn targets very specific disadvantaged communities to recruit from to bring up their numbers (a few magnet schools in Philly and other cities) while ignoring the other disadvantaged people outside.

Why is no one talking about the pass fail policy?,WHOAHOAAHOAHS,For sure not happening. Penn is notorious for either following what other schools do or taking an opposite approach that is completely nonsensical (usually the lack of action or use of logic). Unless other schools publicly announce that they're doing this there's almost no possibility that they do P/F again this semester. The only likely thing that could happen is that they extend the P/F deadline.,1,,False,fx9tjyb,False,False,1594175095.0,2020-07-07 21:24:55
Why is no one talking about the pass fail policy?,,"I agree A “full P/F semester“ maybe not but it’s not like everybody P/Fed everything last semester either. Actually other schools had a “full P/F semester- not Penn. Almost no one is gonna P/F everything for pre professional/grad school reasons anyway. And it’s not “googling answers” mainly- I’ve seen numerous instances personally of people simply working together or one person takes it takes a quiz then takes a picture and sends it to others who see the questions etc. 

I just think we should have more choice than a normal semester. That’s what P/F is for- a backup for unusual circumstances. Most people I know didn’t P/F most of their classes but we should have that choice as a backup. Something like “you can P/F one class towards a major” sounds reasonable, among others. Do you really think people getting clapped academically with no backup will be as likely to take the time to get tested if they’re feeling unwell before a midterm? Will two people studying really be as likely to socially distance if they’re scared as hell about grades? This is Penn- Penn’s full pressure, this compact, and the shortcomings of online education will not go well together. There is a medium between last semester and this-ignoring that is irresponsible.",6,,1594167659.0,fx9e9nb,False,False,1594166093.0,2020-07-07 18:54:53

Anyone else struggling to make a decision as to whether to return to campus?,WHOAHOAAHOAHS,"I think one thing that people are forgetting which mainly affects juniors and seniors is the fact that it's really Penn housing or bust. While Penn housing is objectively more expensive than off campus housing, there's a lot of security in being on campus (the main thing being possible tuition refunds) despite the many rules that you'll have to follow by living in it. So far I've seen most landlords being firm with their prices for 12mo leases (forget shorter leases and sublets) and they haven't dipped too much in price. It seems like the housing stock is pretty limited now with Penn making deals with landlords to obtain more on campus housing for seniors thus increases prices for rentals overall.  I personally don't see the point in paying market rate for an apartment that I'll only be in for a little under 3 months of the semester with uncertainty about the spring semester. If we're sent back home all that money is down the drain. Yes you can stay in Philly in your apartment but is it really worth? I've heard mixed reviews about staying on campus from people that did so last semester as well as people in Philly now over the summer.

Also, depending on your financial aid Penn may give you a lot in refund. I'm expecting enough housing/dining refund to stretch and cover my rent for 12 months (with the possibility of subletting next summer's months). Could even come out the other end with a little spare cash. Downside of getting housing through Penn is that you're at their will and forced to leave when they say go.

"Honestly, I don't understand why A/Fail isn't a thing.",johnathanjones1998,"\> It would just cause grade inflation for a semester.

Idk if I get the tone here, but it seems to imply grade inflation is a bad thing. I hardly think that one semester of A/Fail would earn Penn a moniker of  ""Harvard 2.0"" and even if it does...what's the consequence? Grade inflation is just a term that carries no real repercussions (though we've been trained to think it does). 

But breaking down the situation here:

Imagine you're a premed. A non-trivial amount of medical schools say they will prefer to get letter grades instead of P/F grades. So P/F'ing a course is functionally not an option for many students on penn's campus. 

So now the options are mandatory P/F or just keep normal procedures in place (basically what penn's doing right now minus being able to use P/F for fulfilling reqs).

In the mandatory P/F world, people who wanted to use this semester to increase their grade get screwed over.

In the ""keep calm and carry on"" world of just not altering policies, anyone who experiences changes in circumstances due to COVID is also screwed over.

A/Fail or triple-A is effectively the best of both worlds. People who want to distinguish themselves still have an A+ to strive for. People who are affected by COVID likely won't suffer a ding on their transcript. Yeah, some students may get a higher grade than they were supposed to but...eh? Anyone who cares to look can see an A- would mean the person was in the bottom third of the class and can accordingly make adjustments if they care to do so. 

Will I think it'll get implemented? probably not...just bc some faculty would prefer the vast majority of students get a C and ugrad is too inflated as is (so they'd endorse anything that goes against inflation in general).",12,,1586303816.0,fmqktcg,True,False,1586301580.0,2020-04-07 18:19:40

Both as an alumni and a potential employer I don't want grade inflation. Even as a student I fully understood why it was beneficial to at least have a small curve. It's good for better performing students to be able to distinguish themselves.

is Penn 200 iq or walking into a covid death trap?,singularreality,"So, it is neither.  Whether the health of students and those that work at Penn and the surrounding community will be worse off for the decision to invite all undergrads on campus will depend largely upon how seriously undergraduates comply with the campus rules and whether Penn will be able to quickly monitor and react to new infections, keeping the infection rate manageable.   If new  infections begin to go to an unacceptable level, then the campus could be closed before Thanksgiving and if things go well, they could even open up some things.  I can't help but ponder the question of what everyone would be doing (when not studying) if the campus were closed.  What interactions would students have, what jobs would they take, with how many, who and where would they socialize and would they not go shopping, get hair cuts, go to the beach and the grocery store and potentially be in equally or similar compromising situations than if on campus (but without any rules for behavior)...  And at home, presumably, undergrads. will be around parents, older persons and their families.  I can tell you that the way to improve the situation is to abide by all the restrictions and do not try to game the system by having large get togethers etc... It will be quite tough, and interactions must be in very small groups and a lot of hand washing, mask-wearing and distancing.  Young persons mostly fair well, particularly at 18 through the first half of the twenties.... The term ""death trap"" is a very scary term... and serious illness is not inconceivable but still rare (at least based on current data) for the undergraduate age category.....A huge concern is if there is a spike at Penn, how will this affect the surrounding community and parents and families of student.  I hope that before students go home Thanksgiving, that they get tested.  Finally, if you believe that the situation is too risky for you personally or if you are unable to comply with the restrictions, then do not come back to campus for the fall.

It also likely has to do with the large proportion of students who live off-campus compared to other schools.

(not many people at all), Spruce... etc.... many Penn students, stafff, grad students, drs.. phd's etc... were wearing masks (most I saw were) randomly walking on the streets when school was not in session.  I do not mean to suggest that students are not partying and doing all sorts of crazy stuff... some are and some will.   I don't mean to suggest that there is not a huge problem.  And I know for a fact that people that live together in apartments or frats are not wearing masks in their home... and don't wear masks when they jog or are in places outside when nobody is near them or are resonably far... but people are wearing masks in stores...... I also know that people with jobs (lab jobs on campus for example) are absolutely practicing social distancing.  Students at Penn who are not on campus are probably just as likely --without structure or rules --- to behave poorly or to behave well (with respect to CV).  To say that they are ""all"" doing this or that or that they are ""all"" partying is false. I can say that with confidence.

please tell me i'm not the only one who's still undecided about the fall,singularreality,"This is a forum for discourse and our opinions will get upvoted or downvoted by our reddit friends as they wish.  The  original post was something like:   tell me if I am the only one still undecided for the fall.....  Is your point that everyone should not attend school in the fall because there will be an outbreak at Penn due to the behavior you are aware of?  Please share your point if that is not it with all of us.   

I will share my points.  I have observed a surprisingly responsible scene on campus.  and in the areas just surrounding campus during the weekday in the middle of the day this summer and I believe that if you are wearing a mask outside when it is not that crowded, you are likely concerned enough to take precautions inside and limit your gatherings.  And I also can speak for many people I know who are right now acting much more responsibly than you suggest... I conclude that for some -- and it depends on a lot of things, that attending campus as currently envisioned by Penn is better than not attending.  Some will not find the risk acceptable and learn online and others will defer... that is up to each person and you are free to do whatever you want of course.

  
Penn students will get tested first and we should use this forum to encourage the vast majority to then abide by the restrictions in the fall and work together.  This is a war against a virus and we should be fighting together to discourage the behaviors you point out.  Yes there will be some small get togethers.. and partying... hopefully they will be smaller and involve some distancing; obviously many will not abide by the restrictions.  There will be infections.  There may be an outbreak in the fall and it may come before Thanksgiving.  It might be worse to be at Penn than home and it may not be.  You will make your decision for yourself and so will others. Penn can send everyone home if need be and you can go home anytime you like.  Those at risk...  it is better to stay at home of course...... 

Neither of us should get a free pass for lack of critical thinking which is your accusation against ""people"" who I guess I am one of.  Neither should I take your exaggerations literally.... uhhhh, except if you actually say we should, as you wrote: ""Literally no one out of the huge amount of ppl living off campus this week is social distancing"".   You were very specific about what is going on off campus ... pretty emphatic about guarantying that nobody is wearing a mask and no one is distancing... .If that is hyperbole then maybe in this environment we could do without it.    

Everyone, good luck with you decision.  Stay healthy.",2,,False,fzu0mpf,False,False,1596172471.0,2020-07-31 00:14:31

Penn Greek Life GPA Report,h8er-boi,"there is a reason why there are more networking events for women, because at the end of the day, sure there are diversity programs, but there is still an overwhelming propensity to hire men in most industries. So women need to prove themselves in other ways. Yes. The women’s programs with superdays do hire just women. However, 1) a lot of these networking events don’t have superdays and don’t end up being that valuable 2) when it comes to regular hires there is definitely still a bias. So it ends up being women competing amongst themselves during these diversity programs and then when it comes to regular recruiting the unconscious bias for men kicks in. Obviously a generalization but definitely a trend. 
Companies are working towards more diversity. No one wants to be sexist. I think that men have to rely less on GPA to succeed. Personally, I don’t even think GPA is that important or determines intelligence. It’s just that in my experience and from the research I’ve been exposed to, women rely on a track record of past success while men can rely more on confidence, the inherently tighter networks of their frats, and the unconscious bias in the recruiting processes.",4,,False,flsh6h8,False,False,1585442034.0,2020-03-28 19:33:54

[Mega-thread] Penn & COVID-19 Response,Marbleman60,"PSA. READ ME.

""We can now read the report on COVID-19 that so terrified every public health manager and head of state from Boris Johnson to Donald Trump to the dictator of El Salvador that they ordered people to stay in their houses. I read it yesterday afternoon and haven't been the same since. I urge everyone to read it, but maybe have a drink first, or have your family around you. It is absolutely terrifying. The New York Times confirms that the CDC and global leaders are treating it as factual.

Here's a brief rundown of what I'm seeing in here. Please correct me in comments if I'm wrong.

The COVID-19 response team at Imperial College in London obtained what appears to be the first accurate dataset of infection and death rates from China, Korea, and Italy. They plugged those numbers into widely available epidemic modeling software and ran a simulation: what would happen if the United States did absolutely nothing -- if we treated COVID-19 like the flu, went about business as usual, and let the virus take its course?

Here's what would happen: 80% of Americans would get the disease. 0.9% of them would die. Between 4 and 8 percent of all Americans over the age of 70 would die. 2.2 million Americans would die from the virus itself.

It gets worse. Most people who are in danger of dying from COVID-19 need to be put on ventilators. 50% of those put on ventilators still die, but the other 50% live. But in an unmitigated epidemic, the need for ventilators would be 30 times the number of ventilators in the United States. Virtually no one who needed a ventilator would get one. 100% of patients who need ventilators would die if they didn't get one. So the actual death toll from the virus would be closer to 4 million Americans -- in a span of 3 months. 8-15% of all Americans over 70 would die.

How many people is 4 million Americans? It's more Americans than have died all at once from anything, ever. It's the population of Los Angeles. It's four times the number of Americans who died in the Civil War...on both sides combined. It's two-thirds as many people as died in the Holocaust.

Americans make up 4.4% of the world's population. So if we simply extrapolate these numbers to the rest of the world -- now we're getting into really fuzzy estimates, so the margin of error is pretty great here -- this gives us 90 million deaths globally from COVID-19. That's 15 Holocausts. That's 1.5 times as many people as died in World War II, over 12 years. This would take 3-6 months.

Now, it's unrealistic to assume that countries wouldn't do ANYTHING to fight the virus once people started dying. So the Imperial College team ran the numbers again, this time assuming a ""mitigation"" strategy. A mitigation strategy is pretty much what common sense would tell us to do: America places all symptomatic cases of the disease in isolation. It quarantines their families for 14 days. It orders all Americans over 70 to practice social distancing. This is what you've seen a lot of people talking about when they say we should ""flatten the curve"": try to slow the spread of the disease to the people most likely to die from it, to avoid overwhelming hospitals.

And it does flatten the curve -- but not nearly enough. The death rate from the disease is cut in half, but it still kills 1.1 million Americans all by itself. The peak need for ventilators falls by two-thirds, but it still exceeds the number of ventilators in the US by eight times, meaning most people who need ventilators still don't get them. That leaves the actual death toll in the US at right around 2 million deaths. The population of Houston. Two civil wars. One-third of the Holocaust. Globally, 45 million people die: 7.5 Holocausts, 3/4 of World War II. That's what happens if we use common sense: the worst death toll from a single cause since the Middle Ages.

Finally, the Imperial College team ran the numbers a third time, this time assuming a ""suppression"" strategy. In addition to isolating symptomatic cases and quarantining their family members, they also simulated social distancing for the entire population. All public gatherings and most workplaces shut down. Schools and universities close. (Note that these simulations assumed a realistic rate of adherence to these requirements, around 70-75% adherence, not that everyone follows them perfectly.) This is basically what we are seeing happen in the United States today.

This time it works! The death rate in the US peaks three weeks from now at a few thousand deaths, then goes down. We hit, but don't exceed (at least not by very much), the number of available ventilators. The nightmarish death tolls from the rest of the study disappear; COVID-19 goes down in the books as a bad flu instead of the Black Death.

But here's the catch: if we EVER relax these requirements before a vaccine is administered to the entire population, COVID-19 comes right back and kills millions of Americans in a few months, the same as before. The simulation does indicate that, after the first suppression period (lasting from now until July), we could probably lift restrictions for a month, followed by two more months of suppression, in a repeating pattern without triggering an outbreak or overwhelming the ventilator supply. If we staggered these suppression breaks based on local conditions, we might be able to do a bit better. But we simply cannot ever allow the virus to spread throughout the entire population in the way other viruses do, because it is just too deadly. If lots of people we know end up getting COVID-19, it means millions of Americans are dying. It simply can't be allowed to happen.

How quickly will a vaccine be here? Already, medical ethics have been pushed to the limit to deliver one. COVID-19 was first discovered a few months ago. Last week, three separate research teams announced they had developed vaccines. Yesterday, one of them (with FDA approval) injected its vaccine into a live person, without waiting for animal testing. Now, though, they have to monitor the test subject for fourteen months to make sure the vaccine is safe. This is the part of the testing that can't be rushed: the plan is to inoculate the entire human population, so if the vaccine itself turned out to be lethal for some reason, it could potentially kill all humans, which is a lot worse than 90 million deaths. Assuming the vaccine is safe and effective, it will still take several months to produce enough to inoculate the global population. For this reason, the Imperial College team estimated it will be about 18 months until the vaccine is available.

During those 18 months, things are going to be very difficult and very scary. Our economy and our society will be disrupted in profound ways. Worst of all, if the suppression policies actually work, it will feel like we are doing all this for nothing, because the infection and death rates will be very low. It's easy to get people to come together in common sacrifice in the middle of a war. It's very hard to get them to do so in a pandemic that looks invisible precisely because suppression methods are working. But that's exactly what we're going to have to do.""

Anyone worried about not being able to be social now that everything is online?,Kinsoo," I'm a grad student who just began his Zoom classes at Penn. Here are some things that I have learned & helped me make new friends:

* Loving your Zoom breakout rooms. I started out the meeting with a hello and complimented their cats/dogs/zoom background to get the conversation going
* Join the group study session. It sounds somewhat weird but it gives me peace of mind & allows some time for us to talk about mundane topics

I don't consider myself a social person (my ideal weekend is lying down on a bed while hugging my pillow) but I do think it's possible to make new friends using an online platform. Plus Zoom has some awesome features that help me with the people; I suck at memorizing names so a name display on Zoom is a godsend feature. I also think it's important to say hi first to your classmates; they will really appreciate you for reaching hands at them first. 

Please remember that everyone is feeling the same (it's not just you) and try to reach out to your classmates as much as possible.

Anyone worried about not being able to be social now that everything is online?,supremeleaderbub,"Honestly Penn is mostly protecting itself, its reputation and West Philly by moving completely online. They are eliminating every and any incentive on their end that would motivate students to return to campus. They’ve made it so there’s absolutely no point to return to Philly in terms of being able to utilize Penn’s resources/campus. The college age group isn’t exactly trustworthy when it comes to adhering to strict social distancing guidelines. There have been a few instances already of colleges that have started in person and are already having issues maintaining social distancing and consequent outbreaks. I think Villanova just had a big issue with hundreds of freshmen gathering to party. A student is going to have much more social contact living in/traveling to Philly than if he/she had stayed at home. It sucks, because being at home can be a very negative experience for people for varying reasons. But I don’t blame Penn for dipping out of what is essentially a losing battle. The most responsible thing they could do at this point is decrease the number of people on/near campus as much as possible (even if 1000 less students are in Philly, that’s a huge success) and not provide any gathering spaces.",1,,False,g1m703f,False,False,1597510549.0,2020-08-15 11:55:49

Philly public schools will stay all-online at least until November,johnathanjones1998,"Full Text in case there's a paywall:   
\--------------------------

Philadelphia public school students will not return to classrooms until November at the earliest, Superintendent William R. Hite Jr. said Tuesday, after plans for [a hybrid model](https://www.inquirer.com/education/philadelphia-schools-reopening-school-district-plan-released-20200715.html) of in-person and online instruction [sparked fierce opposition](https://www.inquirer.com/education/coronavirus-philadelphia-school-reopening-guidelines-virtual-digital-childcare-20200723.html).

Under the new plan, which still awaits school board approval, the year would begin fully virtually for 125,000 Philadelphia School District students in September, as [confirmed coronavirus cases rise in the region](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/) and other districts are also opting to start the year without face-to-face instruction.

If city health officials and others indicate it is safe to do so, students would then transition to a hybrid learning model.

Initially, Hite had called for a school reopening plan that would bring most students back two days a week. That plan received intense pushback — including six hours of impassioned calls from principals, [parents](https://www.inquirer.com/education/philadelphia-schools-reopening-plan-parents-childcare-families-20200715.html), and [teachers](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/school-district-of-philadelphia-reopening-plan-teachers-20200719.html) at [a school board meeting](https://www.inquirer.com/education/coronavirus-philadelphia-school-reopening-guidelines-virtual-digital-childcare-20200723.html) last week and [a public rally for fully virtual schools](https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-school-district-reopening-virtual-police-rally-march-20200725.html) last weekend. [Hite ultimately withdrew it](https://www.inquirer.com/education/philadelphia-school-board-plan-coronavirus-reopening-hite-20200724.html).

“I believe it’s important to listen,” Hite said in a letter to the community Tuesday. “And it’s important to have your trust and support as we all try to create a plan that will help our children learn in an environment we have never experienced.”

The school board is scheduled to vote Thursday on the health and safety elements of the revised plan, and on the revised school opening date.

Officials said students will still have access to free school meals throughout the continued building shutdown, as they have since March.

“City leaders are also working with numerous local internet companies to provide reliable internet access to all Philadelphia students who need it for the start of school and throughout the school year,” the district said in a letter to families sent Tuesday.

Hite said this weekend that he does not support a 100% virtual school year, and that if coronavirus conditions improve, he wants teachers and students back in classrooms.

“We will do harm to children if in fact we lose another year without children in front of adults in some form or fashion,” the superintendent said Friday night. “We know that our children who are most at risk suffered the most academically in the spring. As educators, we can do something about that, and we need to do something about that.”

“Never in our lifetimes have we seen a situation like this, and there is no road map for how to navigate so many factors. ... Lives are on the line,” Jordan said in a letter to PFT members.

The district’s announcement comes as a number of other districts make plans to begin the year virtually. Downingtown, Cheltenham, and Norristown have all announced in recent days their intent to keep children out of buildings, at least for now.

“I will not be the superintendent who puts anyone — not one child, not one staff member — in harm’s way,” Norristown Area Superintendent Christopher Dormer said. “I cannot, in good conscience, allow any reopening model that increases the risk of infection, illness or someone dying.”

The Archdiocese of Philadelphia said Tuesday that most elementary school students would return to buildings five days a week, and high school students would begin the year with a hybrid digital and in-person approach.",15,,False,fzkkhg4,True,False,1595982507.0,2020-07-28 19:28:27

* What is the grading curve like for intro premed course requirements? Like for general chemistry or intro bio. Is there actually deflation?
* How difficult are the exams for intro premed requirements? Is it super easy to lose points with dumb mistakes and land yourself with a 50%? 
* How collaborative vs cutthroat is the premed environment?
* How difficult is it to get into clubs here (both medicine related ones and clubs in general)?

For more context, I have been accepted to Penn, Vandy, and CMU, and right now Penn is my most expensive option (by a lot). CMU doesn't seem like the best option for pre-med, and I've seen A LOT of threads complaining about general chemistry and grade deflation at Vandy.

I haven't really seen this level of horror about pre-med at Penn, but from my research the weed-out courses here also seem pretty intense. I've also seen that Vandy intro premed courses grade on a B-/C+ curve (that seems pretty standard, so I don't really understand why there's so many deflation complaints), and I was wondering if UPenn was the same? 

UPenn seems pretty competitive, so is there a reason that there's not THAT much complaining, or am I just looking in the wrong places?

My parents like Penn a lot (for the prestige) and are supporting me to come. I'm just very concerned about the cost though because medical school tuition is no joke, and also the difficulty of getting into clubs here.

I’m a high school sophomore (rising junior) and I have the amazing opportunity to pursue my associates degree in the Fall. I would be getting my associates in January 2022 and I would graduate high school with my diploma in May 2022. I have a few questions as far as applying to UPenn, more specifically for Wharton! 

1) Would I apply to UPenn as a first year college student or a transfer student?

2) Does UPenn have certain policies in place for dual enrollment credits? I’ve read that some institutions will allow the transfer of credits under certain situations, but seeing as I would have already gotten my associates, is there a chance I would have to retake classes or would I just apply straight to graduate?

Any other tips would be amazing. Thank you to those who answer my question!",1,,False,fnlbm8q,False,False,1587050654.0,2020-04-16 10:24:14

Most of all though, its the residential programs that really make KCEH shine. Between STWing (Science and Technology Wing), WiCS (Women in Computer Science - also a club in addition to being a residential program), Biosphere, PiH (Perspectives in Humanities), and Huntsman, anyone will be able to find people who share similar interests.


KCEH tends to have strong communities, and plenty of people go to parties.  KC bathrooms tend to be clean, and the rooms are huge which is very nice. Plus, if you think you would fit into one of the residential programs (Biosphere, STWing, PiH) they have very close knit communities formed between people with shared interests. Personally, as someone who is on STWing, it has allowed me to make friends with people ranging from other freshmen to submatriculating superseniors/first year masters students.  Despite having a reputation for being a nerdy floor, there still were some people who frequented frat parties/rushed.  Different people look for different things out of their college experience, but if a close community is something you want, you really cannot go wrong with KCEH.",11,,1585200936.0,flj4m4y,False,False,1585198753.0,2020-03-25 23:59:13

Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),moonlightstreetlamp,"1. Usually curved to around a B/B-. People often say that organic chemistry is curved to a B-/C+, but I've known a lot of people who have taken it and done way better than they expected with that curving scheme. They probably tell you that it's graded so harshly to motivate you to do better, and the grades come out nicer than you expect. Gen chem also allegedly deflates, but I don't know about this one.
2. It can be easy to lose points on exams, but everybody will be in the same boat as you. Everything is on a curve, so you can get a 50% and still wind up being like a standard deviation above the mean (which will almost guarantee you an A in any class). Exam averages for the chemistry classes run around 70%, but it depends on your professor.
3. The people saying that premed is collaborative are nuts. I'm not premed but in many of the same classes as them, and it truly is a cockfight for grades. Everybody becomes so accustomed to there being a curve that you are pitted against your fellow classmates to earn your grade. There is a premed fraternity and health related clubs that nearly all of them are part of. Whole volunteering groups have essentially been consumed by premed students. 
4. Not sure about how challenging it is into health clubs. You'd undoubtedly find something you enjoy, and if not, you could be a trailblazer and do your own volunteering/health related things.

All three of your options are good, especially P/V for premed. I would generally advocate for what's cheaper. If your plan is to go to medical school down the line anyway, you will have the same chance coming from either of the two schools, and your undergrad degree will be irrelevant once you're a doctor. Your parents have a point though, Penn has big clout. It just likely won't matter once you're already a doctor.",6,,False,flu1djj,False,False,1585492972.0,2020-03-29 09:42:52
Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),johnathanjones1998,"Grading curve is basically B-/B for most intro premed courses. Orgo is B-/C+ as the average. I feel this may be the case for most premed type courses though at higher ranked institutions. But yes it is deflated compared to the humanities. 


Difficult ish. And Yes. Avgs on exams run in the 60-70% range. 

Can’t really say one of the other. Some people form tight groups that are super collaborative. But those groups tend to be tough to get into. I did just fine going solo! And having TAd some of the kids who did exclusively group work, they used it more as a mechanism to get out of doing work, which really f’d them over on exams. 

Clubs: so...I never had difficulty getting into clubs but I had the skill set they were looking for coming in. Wrt premed clubs specifically, I joined a couple and dropped immediately bc they seemed kinda generic (for lack of a better term). I know it’s harsh but premed clubs (on any campus) tend to be generally “connect to doctors”, “raise money for X national organization”, “volunteering somewhere in the community”, or “go to random 3rd world country”. I did just fine volunteering on my own and serving philadelphia locally, so I had no need for the clubs. But I can understand that others do want a community as well, so the clubs are a good way to get into that. I wouldn’t say it’s difficult to get into premed clubs. 


So...I’ve been a bit negative on premed life at penn but here are some positives. 

1) you sure as hell are going to have a much easier time getting access to resources here. Big schools have a disadvantage of students clawing over resources and research opportunities. 

2) At penn you’re probably way more prepared for whatever med school you go to.

Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),IWantItAll123,"Congrats on some great options! I don't know if you visited these schools beforehand and how close you live to them, but I would also consider how the level of ""fit"" of each school based on criteria outside of premed. Regarding your questions:

1. Yes, grading is generally on a curve, but then for some intro courses like BIOL102 (Intro Biology B) or some upper-level biology and chemistry courses, the curving is a lot more in your favor or is not an issue. General chemistry definitely has a curve of B-, I believe, but if you pick up good study habits early on, go to your professor's/TA's office hours, and find online resources, you should be good. 
2. Some of the exams are difficult, but I'd say that making silly mistakes (something I do a lot haha) is more of something that might take you from 90s to 80s, and that getting in the 50s is something that happens from more of a lack of overarching understanding. While not all of the professors are fantastic for intro-STEM courses (that can be said for so many universities), some really are and the TAs I've had really make sure you understand what you're learning. 
3. I'd say that premed here is pretty collaborative. I've met a few people who might fit the ""cutthroat"" stereotype in terms of personality, but nobody here is out to get everybody or withhold answers or something like that. Since you'll be taking a lot of the same classes with premeds, you're bound to make friends and collaborate on problem sets, studying, etc.  
4. I'm not in any premed clubs myself, but I'd say it kind of depends and it might be a bit ""luck of the draw"" or dependent on how well you get along with the other members of those clubs. Some people thrive in pre-med/pre-health fraternities, others like community service clubs, and there are so many unique ways to meet other premeds or do health-related activities.

I don't know much about CMU's premed reputation, but I'd also look into that if you're looking to compare costs, premed education quality, etc. Vandy is also a great school but your concerns are valid. Best of luck!",4,,False,fltxsq5,False,False,1585490389.0,2020-03-29 08:59:49
Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),varunscs,"1. Most classes are graded on a curve ranging from setting the average grade to a B-, B, or B+ depending on the course and professor. Don't stress about the curve - in most cases it's there to help you and getting curved down (e.g. getting a lower final score than your raw score) is the exception not the rule. I wouldn't say there's any institutional deflation - I guess since classes at Penn especially Organic Chemistry and Biochem are more demanding than at peer institutions, there might be a little deflation in that regard, but in the end think of it as you're paying it forward for MCAT prep. 
2. Exam difficulty really depends on the course, professor, and your personal strengths/weaknesses. I've always struggled with physics so I found those classes harder than Biology/Chem, but I know lots of people who have struggled with Chem and aced physics or some combination. Don't stress out about exam difficulty -- for most classes, yes the exams are more difficult than the practice material, but they're definitely doable and will broaden your thinking. Again depends on the class for how much you'll lose for dumb mistakes - CHEM 101/102 is one where I've heard a lot of complaining due to the grading rubric being less forgiving, but I think you'd have to make dumb mistakes on every question in order to get a 50%. 
3. I wouldn't say the premed environment is cutthroat at all -- again there are definitely those characters that would stab someone in the back if it meant they'd get a grade boost, but that's not something unique to premed at Penn. Most people are collaborative and it's definitely not like helping someone out is going to change how you perform in a course. 
4. I'd say getting into ""premed"" clubs isn't too hard, but again the club culture at Penn is competitive across the board. It's really just about finding clubs you're passionate about and enjoy. 

&#x200B;

Money is definitely a really important consideration, but definitely make your decision based on how you like the school, the people, and the vibe rather than based on prestige or how easy/hard it is to get your target GPA.

\-If you want to do research, you will be able to. CURF is an amazing center that ensures that any undergrad who wants to be involved in research can learn how to get involved.

\-If you want to serve your community in a diverse city with diverse issues, this is the place to be.

\- As a whole, Penn has great professors, and if you need help in a class, you'll be able to access that help, whether its through office hours or free tutoring services.

\-Lots of pre-meds. Could be a pro or con for you, but you definitely will not feel alone.

\-Work life balance. At the end of the day, the majority of Penn students have passions outside of school. You'll find pre-med students performing music, rushing sororities and playing sports. Also: you'll see pre-meds in all kinds of majors here, even Fine Arts. 

\- Great pre-health advisors

Cons:

\-Grade deflation in many pre-med classes. This is inescapable for a prestigious institution IMO, unless you got into Harvard, Yale, or Brown. You will undoubtably have one test that will serve as a moment of reckoning for you as to whether this path is right for you.

\-A competitive environment. Could be a pro or con for you, for me it was a pro because I needed that to push me in the right direction. However, I avoided having pre-med friends because it was just too stressful for me.

\-FOMO. Penn plays hard, and as a pre-med, you will have to make tough choices about whether to go out and have a good time or hunker down and study while the ""rest of the world"" isn't.

Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),jonathanjulius,"SEAS definitely isn't a walk in the park, but you can do well if you put in the time. It also can't hurt to use the resources that Penn gives you (Office Hours, meetings with profs, tutoring if needed, etc). Penn hasn't released official school-specific GPA averages in a while, but the most recent one was from 2001 and Engineering was the lowest of the four with an average GPA of 3.28.

I also would stress that it's a different type of learning than humanities courses and it's difficult to compare them - straight problem sets vs. essays and readings, from experience both offer their own challenges if you take them seriously.

I think a 3.8 is definitely attainable, but it depends on how much you're willing to put in and how well you do in time-pressured exam environments. I think the time pressure aspect is something that people have to adjust to coming in, but it's something you can also get better at as you take more classes.

If you choose your courses carefully and don't take a ton of hard ones in a single semester, you should be fine. To the point of grade deflation, from my experience no curves at Penn Engineering are designed to give you a worse grade than your raw score.

Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),Laurelinthegold,"As someone who has gone through the process, it is not too bad. However, things to point out are that 1) make sure to take appropriate courses for your intended seas major. I initially wanted to transfer from physics to CIS but having only taken cis110, was denied because I had not yet taken cis120 and cis160. Once I took those two courses and ESE215, I was able to transfer to CMPE without any issue. 2) SEAS people are able to p/f writing sem while CAS people are not. Keep that in mind when deciding when to take writing sem. 3) Some writing sems count as Humanities, some other count as social science, while the rest count as free electives. Most people probably would rather writing sem take up an ssh slot than a free elective slot. Plan  accordingly. I took writ 074 which is a free elective because I did not know about this at the time. 4)Freshmen year is probably a decent time to take some language courses if you feel so inclined; because they count as humanities, you can knock out the H reqs and fulfill the depth reqs at the same time. 5) Maintain a decent gpa. It does not have to be stellar, but I am unsure if the cutoff is hard or soft, 3.0 or 3.2, but just do you best not to dip below. 6) Be sure to talk to advisors.

Its either 3 normal classes and a lab or 4 normal class and a 0.5cu class or some other weirder combinations.

Structure is somewhat similar with sections for reading, writing, conversation, and <new one> read-aloud to assess character recognition.

I think it’s harder than AP Chinese bc it’s pen and paper so you have to know your characters (though you can write some pinyin if you forget the hard ones). If you’re a somewhat native speaker (half-hearted weekend chinese schools, for example) you can probably finesse the writing section with pinyin and characters you pick up from the reading section.

If you’re not confident about a certain section, get in some practice! But don’t overdo it - if you’re taking the exam to be placed into a high level course (rather than placing out of requirements), then you want it to be an accurate representation of your skills.

Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),cutchi,"dubois is a great college house.  all the freshmen live on the 4th floor together, and because it’s small there’s a strong sense of community and you really get to know everyone, even the upperclassmen. the house also has a lot of events throughout the semester which can be really fun, and all the staff are very nice and you can tell they genuinely care about you. the suite style is a great advantage because you get your own space, and it comes with a mini fridge and microwave along with the cooktop, but the kitchen downstairs is always available if you want to do any baking. it’s also close to restaurants, the movie theater, the acme that’ll replace frogro, etc. there’s a rec room that’s cool to chill in too. 

if you’re not a fan of walking up and down the stairs to get to your room, keep this in my bc there’s no elevator, and sometimes when coming back from a party it’s hard to go up the stairs, ngl lmao. there’s a dumb waiter though for your stuff and it’s pretty big. but this also gets annoying when doing laundry if you have a heavy load and the dumbwaiter stops working. there are also only 6 washing machines/dryers so try not to do laundry during busy hours. there’s a “gym” in the basement but it’s kind of creepy so you’re better off going to pottruck. distance is also a factor, personally i like walking so this wasn’t a big deal to me but the engineering section could be a good 12 minute walk depending on your speed. keep in mind that you’ll probably be separated from most of the freshmen who live in hill or the quad as dubois is in a largely upperclassmen part of campus.

Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),hegelian_mess,"PPE is quite a popular major, and I've heard of some pre-meds doing it. Same with polisci, which is a bit more easy to combine with pre-med reqs because of how small the major is in requirements (it has 12 CUs if I'm not wrong, with the 16 CUs of PPE). Although PPE is a bigger major it is pretty possible to combine it with a pre-med path and might actually make your experience at Penn more interesting that for someone majoring in Biology solely for the sake of doing pre-med.

Two things that might act as obstacles:

1) You will have less space to experiment. Because virtually none of the courses for pre-med overlap with PPE (maybe the quantitative requirement covers stats but that's minimal), you will have less courses that you can just take without applying to either a College GenEd, major, or pre-med requirements. In addition, you might have to take an additional advanced science course because some med schools want to see more advanced science if you didn't major in a science but this might also come to your advantage if you feel like you want to explore a bit into a specific scientific niche.

2) It might be a bit more difficult to get clinical/scientific research because most labs look for students either majoring in bio/biochem/bioengineering/neuro rather than PPE. However, I think that this can be counter-acted if you emphasize your coursework (the pre-med or science courses you will take) as well as maybe through any minors you might do.

Although I cannot personally fully describe how your pre-med experience might be altered by taking PPE as your major when doing pre-med (I'm a Neuro (BBB) & Philosophy double major), I think it's doable and might be beneficial if you're truly passionate about PPE and perhaps the links to medicine that it could have.

Also, make sure you don't over-focus on doing your requirements and picking a major. Many pre-meds go into the panic of wanting to pick a major by NSO, so they can immediately claim it as a sort-of ""identity"" and be absolutely sure about the oncoming 4 years - freshman year HAS TO BE about exploration. So, take courses for not just PPE and/or pre-med but maybe try out some law-related courses, something from the medical/life sciences (neuro's pretty great), philosophy/religion/cognitive science (also is pretty interesting, although i might be slightly biased), and so on (hope you get the point).

There are plenty of resources for pre-meds and PPE majors, so if you feel like you are interested in consulting with someone, you can check out some groups/people once the semester starts.",2,,False,fvvtul0,False,False,1593027674.0,2020-06-24 14:41:14

Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),eryngium_zaichik,"It can be quite difficult to transfer credits but that shouldn’t stop you. You will have to post transcripts and syllabi and be prepared to have requests rejected. Wharton is notoriously difficult and will most likely either reject your requests or give you weird half credits that will annoy you. Also, if you have any performance- based transfer credits (in my case, piano and a bunch of acting courses) they will automatically be rejected, I’m sorry to say. All that said, I was able to finagle a classical studies credit and half a history credit out of one class, so that was cool. Foreign languages can be weird- the French dept wanted me to take a placement test bf they’d accept French credit but German went through no problem. No idea why. A couple of English credits did transfer, as well. 

Re: dual enrollment- allowed only under special circumstances. I had to petition CAS to let me do a Russian intensive over the summer bc I needed to stack my classes onto two days a week so that I could earn some $.

I've heard through the grapevine that Brown inflates grades, but it would be silly, in my opinion to choose a school based on whether you're going to get straight A's. The most important as to why is because your interest in medicine might change, and then what? Penn has a very high med school acceptance rate, and I think it has a lot to do with the top-notch research opportunities, incredible community service options in a diverse city with unique health challenges, and mentorship available in every facet of your undergraduate career. But Penn also has a lot to offer in dozens of other departments, it has an interdisciplinary academic nature, and finally, the campus culture is unique . I would say an average Penn student is very passionate about their future career and makes specific choices to shape that future for themselves. An average Penn student also loves to nurture a vibrant life outside of class, exploring whatever they want to and making important emotional and professional connections. I can't really speak for Brown, but I heard its very laid-back in its approach to undergrad as a whole, and I would say that Penn isn't. A lot of people at Penn are go-getters; this personally excited me and pushed me in the right direction.

Official Admitted Student Questions Thread (Class of 2024),publu123,"Hi uapp20, so statistically, yes, Brown does give preference to its undergrads. I think around 1/3 of its med school class are students enrolled in their 7 year BA/MD program that you apply for before you go. They also show normal undergrad preference outside of that. However, Penn's medical school is significantly stronger than Brown's, if you consider match list to residency, match list, and community engagement opportunities. At the end of the day, you shouldn't assume you'll get into either program, because med school is even more of a crapshoot than undergrad for getting into top 20 schools. 

It's really difficult to answer the question ""is Penn a stress environment."" Reflecting on undergrad, most of my friends came from either my a capella group or my freshman hall, and very few of them were premed. They had diverse interests, and I felt comfortable and happy around them. I personally didn't engage much with the ""premed crowd"" cuz you don't really have to. The classes were hard, so I worked hard, went to office hours, got tutoring if needed, and just did what I had to do to meet my own expectations. The fact that a lot of my peers in premed or outside of it were very ambitious and driven only served to my benefit, because it pushed me to heights I never thought I'd get to. I personally liked being surrounded by smart and driven people-it worked for me. 

This is purely anecdotal, but I had a coworker who graduated from Brown. She absolutely loved Brown. However, she applied to medical school this year and did not get in anywhere, and is now doing a one-year post-bacc at Penn. That's the caveat of a ""non-stressful, laid-back environment""-will you achieve what you need to to get into medical school? Medical school is a highly competitive, cutthroat application process. It helps to have people who understand that and want to help you navigate and prepare for it as much as possible, and I found those people at Penn.",2,,False,flxvrot,False,False,1585590753.0,2020-03-30 12:52:33

The fact that Penn is adjacent to its med school and all of its research centers gives you literally hundreds of labs that you can join.

It might take a little bit of nudging by emailing, going to their office or a talk they're giving, etc, but you can certainly be involved in research of all sorts.

Maybe you could run into some professor that won't take you, even though it's pretty unlikely, but there is such an abundance of labs that you would surely find another.

then there’s the benefit. sure you get to say you’re in this prestigious program, but in reality there’s few entry level jobs that would pay more for people with both engineering and business degrees.

wharton single degree kids have about as easy of a time as m&ts getting jobs in investment banking or consulting, and engineering kids can just as easily get jobs in tech.

therefore, you’re heavily exerting yourself for all four years of college while you are gaining a marginal amount, career wise. engineering and especially wharton are known to already be the top programs in their fields, so if you’re planning to do business/tech, you might as well just stick with one degree. that said, this is all a very penn-centric way of thinking about m&t. if you actually love both fields, i’m sure it’s worth it.",1,,False,ftjhtjb,False,False,1591753589.0,2020-06-09 20:46:29

In general, the right way to do things is to sign up for one more class at the start of a semester than you think you'll be able to take/the minimum you must take. That is, for the first semester, my take on it is that you should sign up for 6 classes. It is totally likely that you'll think this is too many and unreasonable, and you have something like an entire month to drop a class without any effects on your transcript or anything. At worst you'll have wasted a little bit of effort and still learned something, at best you might even realize that you can handle it just fine and you'll get ahead of things. Dropping a class is a tool to calibrate your courseload, and not something to be ashamed of/an indicator of a lack of success. 

Also, in my experience, freshman year was more challenging to take more classes in because the courses you have to take give more assignments. In the upper level classes, you get fewer assignments and become more capable of handling things, so a fair amount of people (still a minority) take more classes. 

When you come in, you should have the expectation that you'll be taking 5 classes for the first semester. Don't set yourself up thinking you'll take more than that. From a practical standpoint as well, I can tell you that there genuinely isn't a real or good reason to take more than 5 each semester. You will be able to double major and get a master's degree in 4 years by taking 5 classes each semester, as long as you plan well. You shouldn't at all feel the need to push yourself to do more than the MLS minimum, because even the minimum for you will be substantially more than what most students in the college do.",3,,False,flyjx18,False,False,1585603542.0,2020-03-30 16:25:42

Amy Gutmann in Fall Semester: “likely combination of in-class and virtual teaching”,supremeleaderbub,"All of my classes will be large lecture classes besides physics lab, which still seems prone to transmitting germs via the equipment and surfaces.

And if they close many of the study spaces and libraries as they did this spring, I don’t want to spend thousands of dollars on rent and living expenses to be crammed in my apartment watching lectures all day just because I have to be on campus to go to a lab once a week.

This doesn’t address shared bathrooms in dorms or elevator buttons or social gatherings or frats and sororities and a lot of other things that would be hard to control after bringing back thousands of students to campus. One of the biggest challenges with COVID-19 is how contagious it is. It spreads like wildfire and takes just one person bringing it to campus for hundreds if not thousands to get infected.

And sorry but everyone saying the virus is not a big deal to college-aged students is ignorant. I’m in NY and had it, and both of my parents had it, as well as many friends and relatives. It was the worst I had ever felt. Friends described it as the worst flu or cold they ever had. One parent ended up hospitalized for a week. A few people I knew have died from this. But it’s not just about the college-aged population who will likely recover without a problem: it’s the many people they come in contact with who might not be able to recover so easily.

If other populations/cities end up seeded with the virus as NY was, the consequences will be disastrous. I mean... it was a disaster here.

Amy Gutmann in Fall Semester: “likely combination of in-class and virtual teaching”,nicktowe,"12-18 months is the optimistic timeframe for a vaccine development.  It may take many years and failed candidates.  There are many diseases for which there are no vaccines.

Here’s a good chapter on vaccines.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780723436911001033

There’s a PDF there.  Page 1105 begins a section on “Vaccines Not Yet Available” that describes how it may be that vaccines are not found despite great need and extensive research (HIV, TB, malaria).  One of the reasons is vaccines are often found by studying the natural immunity that the sick have developed after recovering.  But some diseases do not result in such acquired immunity.  

Unfortunately, that might be true for our new corona virus.  Many health scientists have noted that that they’re not sure that people who have recovered from COVID-19 have immunity.

https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/25/844939777/no-evidence-that-recovered-covid-19-patients-are-immune-who-says

Some of these stories report cases of patients who recovered, tested negative and then later testing positive again.  Although this could be a problem with testing, this might mean that we can’t rely on immunity, either from natural immunity following recovery or a lack of vaccine.  In such case, we’d have to rely on quick infrastructure of widespread testing followed by contract tracing of positive carriers and quarantine of individuals linked to them in order to keep the disease in control.

But this requires leadership to develop and organize the  testing / contact tracing army that we’d need for that.  And in this country, it’s been an absolute shitshow on the leadership front.   Even today, months into the pandemic, per capita we’re nothing in the testing and aggressive contact tracing that helped places like South Korea do so much better, despite their proximity and extensive trade/travel with the viruses origin.",7,,False,fosyue5,False,False,1588040933.0,2020-04-27 21:28:53

Penn cited, notably, two reasons for not going HYBRID 1) they didn't have the testing capacity they thought they did (which I find remarkable, cause they thought they had it three weeks earlier) and 2) they felt they did not have the ability to quarantine the number of people that are supposed to be quarantined from hot spots (although that should have been a choice for those people coming from hot spots).  Both these hurdles might be overcome by Penn with testing advances and a mandatory quarantine procedure for those from hot spots and those who are positive.  Students have to act way more responsibly and have to commit to it in advance.  What is going on at other schools right now shows that everyone has to be on the same page; no bars, no frat parties, no large gatherings of any kind, no crowds in the stadiums or Palestra and sadly, a limited or much much different spring fling.

What do you like to do for fun? Is there something you’ve always wanted to try? Does Penn have a club for that?

Do you identify with any cultural groups on campus? Maybe a religion?

I’ve also made some good friends from volunteering. Helping others helped me get through lonely times. Highly recommend doing Penn Alternative Breaks or groups affiliated with Civic House.

Friends,Housesize3,"I've continued thinking about this in the month since I posted this and one of the things I've found since then is that it depends on whether your hobby is _creation_ or _consumption_. Not judging either one and not saying one is better, but the approach is different.

Consumption is stuff like listening to music, watching movies, reading books, watching anime, eating Greek food, playing video games. For these types of hobbies, the solution is to find people who meet regularly to consume whatever it is. Anime club. Video games club. Book club. You can look on websites like meetup.com and facebook to find events in the area (not just at UPenn!) for events like these. Make sure the group meets _regularly_. It's easier to find one that exists already than to organize your own.

Creative stuff is like writing, sports, painti
programming computers. The answer to this is to be extremely prolific. Somewhere along the way, you get a much clearer picture of how to find the people that you _won't_ know until you actually do the thing a lot. If you have a blog, then write a hundred blog posts. If you like music, write a hundred songs and go to a hundred open-mic nights. I know it sounds like magic, but it works. And it doesn't need to be _good_, it just needs to be complete. If you write a hundred things, make sure to actually publish all 100 on your blog.

"if you’re paying the full 80k, how much do your parents make?",chemtiger8,"There are people in a bracket where their family makes too much to get any financial aid, but also $80k is not an insignificant amount of money. For example, if a family makes 300k a year, about 1/3-1/4 of that would go to paying for Penn. The amount is probably reduced by taxes, and then they probably have to pay things like mortgages and other upkeep expenses, as well as live on that money. Not to mention if they have a sibling also in college, there’s another possibly 10-70k gone.

"if you’re paying the full 80k, how much do your parents make?",penn2022,"Honestly, I think there’s a huge difference. For example, you mentioned in your post you had two parents. 2 parent households are associated with higher incomes, better intellectually stimulating atmosphere, etc. 100k means you don’t have to worry about getting a part time paid job as a student, and you can instead focus on studying and clubs (which can be very expensive). More tangibly, you can hire tutors and prep classes for standardized tests and such. There’s also a pretty drastic mental price tag on economic instability. 100k/year means your parent(s) likely got a college degree and have encouraged you to do so as well, while less might mean something else. In practice, public schools are funded proportionately to how much residents of the neighborhood make, so schools in neighborhoods where the average income is 100k are a lot different where the average income is the national average or lower. While 100k is kind of arbitrary, my point is that there’s a significant difference in opportunity between the upper 10th decile of income earners and the national mean.",0,,False,fx1ml4w,False,False,1593990423.0,2020-07-05 18:07:03
"if you’re paying the full 80k, how much do your parents make?",DoomDarkHero,"I guess I am speaking in a general sense of how to act. For example, I personally felt very shocked during my first semester because all of the students that came from much more wealthier backgrounds than myself, e.g. hearing them mention the private schools they went to, places they've travelled, as well as simply the clothes they wear (Canada Goose o.o). At first, I felt upset and angry about how everyone else did not seem to understand how lucky they were compared to myself, but I realized that talking to people about my background (e.g. working class immigrant parents), a lot of people seemed very considerate, although of course there were those who seemed put off and probably did not want to bother ""networking"" with me.

I don't see how anyone who has been at the Penn for any amount of time can reasonably call the police ""militarized."" The entire petition is filled with inflammatory misleading language. 

There is no ""Police state"" at Penn.  

Members of the Philadelphia community are not blocked from entering campus, and it's not remotely unreasonable to only allow Penn students, faculty, and staff into the vast majority of Penn buildings. 

Crime alerts get sent for certain types of crimes, crimes that affect the immediate safety of people in the area--attempted or actual burglaries and armed robberies, for example. They are not based on race. The petition does not specify which ""crimes committed by predominantly white university students on campus"" are not being given equal treatment. It would be nice for them to cite some examples.

Penn does not ""owe"" taxes to the city of Philadelphia.  And Penn already does more for public education in Philly than any other University.  It educates many of the teachers in Philadelphia. It supports and funds public schooling.  (The Penn Alexander school being a great example)

Police in Philadelphia need guns.  It is absurd to propose that Penn Police (these are actual police, remember, not security guards) shouldn't carry guns on campus. With the exception of police, guns are ALREADY banned on campus, and any student caught with a gun would be expelled and a staff or faculty member who had a gun on campus would be fired. This is existing policy.

Although ironically, if Penn paid property taxes, it would also increase funding to the Philadelphia police.

Yes, I'm very aware of the reasons why Penn funds the Alexander school, the gentrification of the neighborhood, and the highly unethical way Penn achieved it.  Penn provides more resources to Alexander than to any other public school, yes, but it's not ""the only school they're involved"" with. GSE students work at many Philly schools, undergrads tutor Philly school students, the Penn Libraries do outreach with several schools (including significantly with the Lee School in West Philly), the Netter Center is involved with multiple schools, etc.  Could they do more? Sure, of course. But don't argue that Penn does little to nothing to help public education in Philadelphia.

The Penn police are a private police force, certified through the state of Pennsylvania, and they have the legal authority to operate as police on Penn's campus.

But the things you mentioned (including the free labor of students, which should not be confounded at all with institutional responsibility) are indeed little to nothing given Penn's status in the community, the ways in which Penn harms the community (e.g., Penn Alexander), and the amount of resources Penn has the ability to share but refuses to do so. In case it matters, this is coming from someone who studied education at Penn, worked in Philly schools as an undergrad, taught in Philly schools after graduating, got a Masters in education at Penn, and now a year away from earning an Education PhD. The ways that Penn acts regarding local education are actively contributing to inequality. 

The issues with Penn police are connected with this idea too, given that Penn police's budget is around $27 million, that they are the largest private police department in the state (how this is a ""selling"" point is beyond me--it's quite a damning indictment of Penn's priorities), and that it's clearly they are there to protect Penn property and it's mostly White student body and police against the mostly Black community.

Just the first 3 bullet points in the petition alone are

\-Let anyone who wants to come into any campus building even if they're not affiliated with Penn? Really? 

\-Stop broadcasting the ""so-called commission of crimes"" to the Penn community members?  I don't know about you, but the txts I get are about burglary and armed robbery and things of that type, which people should absolutely be alerted to for their own safety. What are the ""crimes committed by predominantly white university students on campus"" which are being given unfair treatment by not being reported in the same way?  And what makes this practice racialized?  Surely the petition writers aren't aruging that police only alert the Penn community when violent crimes are committed by people of color?

\-Ban the use of guns by police?  Why? No rationale is even given for such a radical proposal.

The Inquirer article talks about how students of color are ""routinely questioned by police and asked to show ID.""

Banning guns, letting anyone roam the halls of any campus building, and not sending crime alerts doesn't solve that or any other problem.

Then I think there are much more helpful ways to be critical than what you are doing, when your main post is overwhelmingly critical and uses words like ""ridiculous"", ""crazy"", and the like. 

You could have worded your concerns about the bullet points re: pilots something like ""Penn should absolutely pay PILOTs, and I wish the petition made this more clear that Penn aren't legally obligated to pay them, but others have done so anyway and Penn should follow"".

Instead of saying that the petitions' claims about the police are ""ridiculous"", you could have said something like ""I'm not sure I'm on the same page about the police's role in the community, but I agree that something needs to be done to reform the police and address racial biases in policing"". 

I agree that words do matter, and if I were involved in the writing of this petition, I would have changed wording here and there as well. I would say: your words matter too, especially in a subreddit like this that typically balks at anything that resembles racial justice at Penn. 

When the top argument that you made, the most upvoted comment in this thread, sounds like it came straight from Penn's Media PR team (see snippet of the article you posted below) and doesn't highlight the need for change or highlight Black and Brown experiences at Penn because it's somehow ""unrelated""...well hopefully you can see who is served and benefited by your words and who aren't.

Based on what we know about this virus so far, that is a very ineffective and late reaction as many people are contagious before they even show symptoms.

That's very hard to estimate right now; it honestly seems like an hour-by-hour standby. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe 25%, but if cases boom as they have in other places, then everything changes. Currently, much like snow days, this decision is being heavily informed by whether local schools are closed, as that would naturally affect faculty and staff and their not being able to leave their children home alone.

The best way you can think about it is like needing to stop some massive machine. There are so many externalities to consider and making a shift like what they've had to do at Washington and other places is incredibly disruptive: hourly staff missing paychecks, important science and hard publishing deadlines being tested, student movement, the academic calendar, all the way down to plumbing and the folks that make this place run. There are a lot of people right now debating that incredibly fine line between being safe (which is everyone's priority) and unnecessarily stopping the machine.

My guess would be there will be campus-wide communication about what's to come by Wednesday.",7,,1583845314.0,fk26f7d,False,False,1583794136.0,2020-03-09 17:48:56

Some other good ones:

Lyns: big, oily, breakfast sandwiches and simple lunch hoagies. She loves her customers, its a shame theres so many that the line becomes prohibitive. Its outside the lower quad gate. 

Breakfast truck two doors down from Lyns: The asian lady is a sweetheart, the breakfast sandwiches are just as good as Lyns imo with less traffic, and shes got salmon burgers! Coffee is yummy too. 

Chez Yasmine: A former Wistar biology researcher whose traveled the world and brought his favorite global tastes back to this food truck. he LOVES his customers, so much that he honors them through pictures, menu item names and shout-outs. I like the couscous, but its pretty pricey. Takes venmo!

Don Memos: best burritos. Lunch line is prohibitive tho. 

Halal trucks: DRL, 46th/walnut (takes card!!!), 41st/walnut, 34th/walnut and the one across from so bol that takes venmo (!!!) (not to be mistaken with the one across wawa) are the good goods. 

My personal ""meh"" trucks: Magic Carpet, the indian food truck (for a samosa fix), the mexican food truck by the quad. I like Schmear it, but its way too expensive for their tiny ass bagels.

SEVP modifies temporary exemptions for nonimmigrant students taking online courses during fall 2020 semester,johnnyking12002,"Does this ruling mean Penn students can’t take online classes from outside the US? Because the email from ISSS did say: 

“Included in the SEVP update is a requirement that international students participate in classes in person if their university is operating under a hybrid model.”

And the ICE announcement also said that if students are taking a completely online course load, they must leave the country (which in most cases means losing immigration status?) or take alternative steps to main status such as a reduced course load or medical leave? 

It clearly doesn’t mention taking classes remotely from outside the US as a way to maintain immigration status.

EDIT: A Wall Street Journal article confirms this: “When schools are offering a hybrid option, with large lectures online and seminars still meeting face-to-face, foreign students on visas must be on-site at the U.S. campus to take a full course load.

SEVP modifies temporary exemptions for nonimmigrant students taking online courses during fall 2020 semester,SimplyShaunY,"If it's not broken, don't fix it. I understand that ICE has laws and regulations to uphold and enforce but could they at least be honest and flexible with the reality that the pandamic is by no means under control in the states. Forcing international students and teachers to meet in person regularly would only serve to increase the likelihood of either party being exposed to and spreading the virus further. This is especially heartless for those who live in places where a second wave is surely to be expected. 

It makes less sense when I think about it. Hey, remember that because of the pandamic, many local business are suffering/failing? Well international students are spending and buying stuff and paying tuitions, so why chasing them away? And how would you expect international students to depart in an orderly fashion when many countries have issued travel bans towards the states and flight tickets are hard to secure?

Edit: also people neglect to mention this but one of the reasons so many people seem like they already know each other (which was a mystery for me too!) is because a lot of them went to the same summer programs, or went to the same high schools, or went to school in the same big cities. If you're like me and have none of those going for you, it's definitely easy to feel a step behind, but don't let that discourage you. There are many people who don't know many people yet, and you'll definitely find your people eventually.

The other reason is some kids sorta throw themselves into the party scene early, but thats definitely not for everyone.

For the safety of students and the broader community, we are encouraging all other students not to return to Philadelphia. "" I don't know how much less active a campus could get.

 \> Also given the fact that on the FB pages people are scrambling to get leases/subleases it obviously shows that there is demand to stay on campus. Not everyone has the luxury of staying home with a good home environment. 

This is a fair point, but if a student was given the choice to live in philadelphia and have to pay at least 12,000$ for an annual lease vs living at home, provided they have the option, I doubt they'd be scrambling to find housing. These are kids who don't have that option. I know dozens of people personally who are locked into paying for leases for places they won't even set a foot in.

\>  Also, the fact that financial aid is basically the same, even with the changes that were announced, staying at home vs off campus is basically the same cost wise. 

What? If you live off campus you'd have to pay 12,000 + extra living expenses, utilities, etc vs 0 at home if you cancelled your on campus lease. Where does the financial aid have to do anything with that?",3,,False,g14t7qm,False,False,1597174261.0,2020-08-11 14:31:01

I’m positive that you’ll find a friend group at some point here—some people I’ve talked to found their close friends senior year and that’s completely fine. First semester it seems like a lot of friendships are platonic and second semester really is like a new season for making new friends and meeting new people.

Loneliness isn't just about being alone. It's about being alone and not wanting to be _while it feels like everyone else seems to have friends._ It's the contrast. That's why it's helpful to realize that this feeling actually isn't that uncommon at Penn, and that there is a concrete way to get better at this sort of thing.

Will you be coming back in the Spring? (You'll lose your housing assignment for the whole year if you don't)

How often are you going to get tested?

Are you capable of being the ""odd one out"" if other people are out going to parties/socializing/being morons and leading to an outbreak?

For me, I chose to return. It's not that my home life isn't great, but it's not. I've been cooped up with five people since March (two of whom are younger siblings) My parents have zero respect for boundaries and privacy and don't understand the phrase ""I have things to do, I can't help you right now."" All of my classes will be online it seems like and I am totally fine with that. I'm going to try and make my apartment as home like as possible and go from there, but I'm looking forward to using this space as a better environment to study etc. I plan to get tested around every two weeks if possible/when I go out to the grocery stores etc and especially right before I come home. For me, I live in a pretty safe area (go NYC) and I know that I'll be able to abide by the mask wearing social distancing policies. 

One of the biggest pushes for me to go back is housing. If there's any chance we can have a somewhat normal spring, with a vaccine, I don't want to lose yet another chance to have a normal life on campus. Another factor is that I haven't made too many friends during my freshman year and would love to get to know more people in my building/through Zoom study groups. The last factor was what will happen to all my stuff. I definitely can't afford to ship it all back and would rather just bring home all my clothes and whatnot in November or whenever we have to come home. 

Honestly, part of me regrets choosing to go back to campus, but another part of me is hoping for the best because I know either way I'm losing, but at least this way I can see what will happen for a little while. (I can even come home earlier if I'd like and you mentioned you could, too) I wish Penn would've implemented something like Cornell did, where people from high risk states have to quarantine for 14 days on campus and everyone has mandatory testing throughout the semester. I definitely would feel much safer under those conditions, but it's up to us to be proactive about everything. Hope this helps!",17,,False,fz14dsl,False,False,1595544484.0,2020-07-23 17:48:04
Returning to campus or staying home?,lambava,"My concern was mainly wasting my parents’ money on rent by coming back, just for the sake of me having a chance at a social life. I miss my community at Penn,  but 1) i can’t justify spending thousands of dollars of my parent’s money just for my social life, and 2) I’m certain campus life will only be a ghost of what it usually is. 

All my classes are online anyway. I have a good home environment, and while I of course prefer to be studying in my own apartment at Penn, I don’t find my preference to be worth the cost. Living in suburban NJ I’m also definitely safer here and have less of a chance of bringing it to my parents.",13,,False,fz1wtb5,False,False,1595560352.0,2020-07-23 22:12:32

You won't technically be paying for a room not in use because the housing cost has been adjusted to reflect the shortened semester. I'd say stick with your original decision because once you decide not to return, there's no changing your mind this semester.

Returning to campus or staying home?,elle_allons-y,"I'm returning even though I live across the country (needa take a long-ass/expensive flight), but there's why:

1) **No pass/fail.** It was really hard to concentrate/do work while at home, not only because of the time difference but also because of my dad and step-mom. 

2) **Likely housing refunds.** If shit hits the fan and Penn evacuates us again, they will likely refund housing, which can allow you to secure off-campus housing/appartement. Basically, coming back to campus can allow you the monetary freedom to have off-campus even if Penn fucks up.

Returning to campus or staying home?,singularreality,"So difficult an issue.  You have a lot to think about.  You are an adult making your own decisions for the most part... Your parents are concerned about you, as is normal... but they are likely vulnerable too, more so than you, but I don't know the particulars.  For your health, you are likely to be safer and healthier (physically, not mentally) at home assuming you will be distancing there and your parents and their friends etc do the distancing, mask thing and they live in an area where the spread is under control -- all things you have to ascertain.  For your parents' health, it could be that they will be  safer if you go to Penn and test yourself before you return at Thanksgiving (and quarantine if you have it then or quarantine for 10 days anyway... you'll be studying mostly anyway).  If you are the type that will break the rules or bend them a little and see friends and go to the beach etc... or go to stores...  when home, staying home may not be so good for your parents and would be a wash for you as compared to being at Penn.  So, it is a weird thing... you might be safer staying home but staying home might make it less safe for you parents.   Ahhhhhhhhh.....  My Penn student child (they are always children to us parents), is going back to school but she will test and or quarantine when she comes back for Thanksgiving... and she happens to be in excellent health etc.. at least as far as we know... so her risk for Covid complications may be less than most... but you never know.  If I could, I would quarantine everyone I know in a wonderful bubble until this thing is over... but I can't, so after all this babble.. you just gotta make a tough call and go with it.

Also, a lot of my classes required participation and my social anxiety got in the way, which made things even worse. I even started to cut myself and was feeling suicidal all the time. I didn’t talk to anyone (even my parents and my close friends in high school) about my struggles because I didn’t want to be seen as weak or incompetent.

Depression: I want to hear your stories,basjanbasjan,"If you don't want to go the CAPS route you can consider going to a therapy practice (like Bloomgarden and Ostroff or Therapy Center of Philadelphia).

These practices generally take insurance and you'll pay a small copay each visit. Though you may find some that are non profit.

Depression: I want to hear your stories,ice_planet_hoth_boss,"I was depressed at Penn and carried that depression into my first job.  Leaving Penn did not cure my depression, and my career got off to a rocky start because of my mental illness.

Without knowing much about you, I'd advise against grinding through Penn just to get a job.  You should get well now, whatever it takes.

Your health must come first - it sounds like you are a lot more at-risk than you realize.  You are also putting a lot of resources into you Penn education - time and money - and not getting much out of it.  And finally, you don't want to walk into your first job still depressed, and risk getting fired, ruining career-enhancing relationships, etc.

I'm really sorry you're going through this - I didn't find CAPS very helpful and I'd recommend you seek treatment off-campus ASAP. ",3,,False,eeowbrc,False,False,1548165924.0,2019-01-22 08:05:24

Depression: I want to hear your stories,san579,"I am a freshman in my second semester. An international student that is around 11,000 km away from home. And I laugh everytime when I see this descent of mine, this change in me, even though ""descent"" is the antonym of getting into/being in an Ivy.

Back in high school, I was the class president. I was this outward, confident person, who always was the one eager to participate, speak his mind, engage with his colleagues, and lead forth the discussion. I loved my teachers, and I would spend many a break simply talking or discussing or arguing with them on this subject or on that field. I knew and respected everyone and they the same. It was a tight knit community, and while not everyone were BFFs, there was a sense of familiarity and mutual understanding/respect. I could walk anytime to any of my teachers up to the school director herself and speak with them. Whenever I and my friends would be walking around the school grounds we would see some of our kin sitting on a table and we would casually join the conversation. You can somewhat say its like a scene from the Friends series.

Then came Penn. It was my first and top choice, applied ED, got accepted. It was a wish come true. I'd avoid using the word ""dream school"", for in my country we don't really think about uni till junior year. I felt like I made the right decision and the perfect choice given it had the program of my choice and its endless opportunities. I don't regret that one bit, for it was the right thing to do. I regret the consequences, and I'm still struggling to come to terms with them and cope.

Its hard enough for American students to leave home - you can imagine what crossing oceans can feel like. I suddenly lost everything. My family, my friends, all the people I knew, the atmosphere I was in - add to that the cultural differences one has to get used to. Start from Fahrenheit and go all the way to tipping and getting embarrased because you didn't know barbers were included in the tip business. You get the gist of it.

My first month and a half were spent crying every night. They were spent adjusting with the onslaught of NSO, classes, people, new faces, new streets, new closet. I literally was hugging my travel bag crying and smelling my mother's perfume in my clothes and sheets. And of course, realizing that I am what they call a ""college student"". I still don't grasp that till now.

I talk to my mother almost everyday. But it isn't easy. She's very far away and I don't want her to worry more than she already is. And, no matter how good of an orator one might be, sometimes it's hard to explain certain situations.

Up to this moment, I have no friends. I literally have no one. Only acquaintances that I exchange the ""hi how r u great"" with. That confident, eager person is gone. You see, it took a long time for that to happen. I'm back to square one, just like in primary school, the one who always preferred to keep to himself in the corner. Silent. Listening. And that's what I'm doing here at college. Back in the class, listening but not talking, observing but not participating. My room has become my sanctuary where I am safe from all that hectic, unfriendly world out there.

Its hard. Its really hard to have no shoulder to lean on. To have no one that understands. I am severely demotivated and panic+anxiety attacks have become a common occurence in my life. The previous me would be screaming ""pathetic"" at the current me who gets panic attacks from simple homeworks. I feel like I have not the capacity nor the willpower to carry the passionate scholarship required at any respectable institution.

It even stings that when someone from my country would lecture me about the need to go out and find people. Don't I know that already? Did they forget the kind of guy I was? Am I not absolutely encircled by this ghastly loneliness that's been eating my soul? Don't they know that I am trying my hardest and reaching out, attending this or that event or talking to this person but things not really working out?

Of course, no one knows. Aside from the fact that I have no one to tell about all this hell I'm going through, and that I'm cooped up in my room when not in the class. I really have mastered the Pennface with my high GPA and some activities - ticking the boxes if you may. And plus, I'm not a big fan of CAPS and opening up to stranges AND, adding insult to injury, being dumped after a few months for external referral. Anyhow, I don't think my case is particularly serious. Its just everyday demotivation and exhaustion. For instance, one time, I met an acquaintance whom I had a pleasant hour long conversation with. The other time would be spending over 2 hours with my professor discussing something. I'd be lit up for days afterwards, regaining some of that brightness of my bygone days back home.

I try to remind myself that I've been through a lot before. That hopefully everything would turn out alright. I am hoping. If not for hope, how can mankind carry on?

Keep hoping. Some one out there loves you, even if you don't know it, and you need to keep going for them. One day you'll look back and see that this was a passing storm that you'll have to battle. Life is a struggle. Its best dealt with your loved ones, friends and family, and even if they're not there with you, the mere thought of them, the times you spent with them, the best times of your life, is what keeps one's spirit going. Right now, I'm living on beautiful memories and radiant hope. They're keeping me going. And I hope they will for you too.

The virus has done that, coupled with poor public policy decisions of the federal administration and some state governments. For sure, there are three options and I believe Penn will accommodate all three: defer your semester or year, learn online, or go to campus and learn in a hybrid situation.  What else can Penn do for you/us?  The answer I hope, is taking as many steps as possible to make the experience as safe and as meaningful as reasonably possible; testing, masks, distancing, sanitary conditions, hand washing, keeping gatherings down, limiting the number of students in dorms and rooms..... are all components of that.  I ask everyone, if you were not going to Penn, where would you be and would you be safer, happier and healthier at Penn or at home?  Would your parents be safer or less safe if you stay at home?

Penn ranked 8th in 2021 USNews rankings,,"Princeton will always get #1 because they're a theory-centric school, hence their students' academic performance will continue to excel because they successfully inculcate the need to strive for A's at their institution in order to stand out. Idk what Columbia is doing at #3 instead of MIT - the latter has had a record number of groundbreaking innovations this past year, and have reduced their criteria for aid qualifications. Columbia #5 (tbh I don't even know what they do there; clandestine on many levels). Stanford #4 (best pre-professional school in the world). Yale, UChic and Penn should be the same ranking because I don't see much disparity in quality among these three schools.  

If Penn wants to increase their ranking they could:

Fund SEAS more. How the hell is Penn SEAS not top 10 in the country. Our school is demanding and competitive, and we also have world class faculty members doing some of the most valuable interdisciplinary STEM research from all Ivies. Penn should literally make it a critical imperative to foster innovative research and amplifying the school's ability to create tech startups. 

Stop overfunding Wharton. Wharton's clout shouldn't confer the ridiculous amount of money they're receiving from the institution. 

Integrate undergrad CAS students (a lot more) with the research being done at Smilow Center. If we can make it easier for premeds and health science kids to contribute to the revolutionary research being done at Penn Med, it will improve their chances of getting into top graduate schools.

That is a significant amount of money that can be used immediately to help students who are already at Penn in this uniquely difficult environment.

> They can pull from older PhD students but that will take away their time which may prolong their own degrees. 

> its becoming an antiquated practice to keep students beyond 5 years.

1. There's almost no job market for graduating PhD students to graduate into. Many research universities have implemented hiring freezes. Covid's left many of these older grad students no choice but to prolong their degree - they're gonna be unemployed otherwise. Given this, the post mentions that more (financial?) support will be given to students who now face extra time-to-degree. So students actually have more incentive to stay.

2. In some fields, it's actually becoming **more** common to keep PhD students for more than 5 years. Just look at the CVs of recent economics PhD grads, the median is 6 years. Compare that to the CVs of tenured professors, and you'll realize that the normative time-to-degree is increasing in most econ and econ-related fields. I can't speak about hard sciences and engineering.

> This also disrupts the research efforts of all the professors where the university benefits from the grants they receive

- I'd argue that newer PhD students actually contribute less to professors' research thank you think because they are usually focused on first-year classes.

Update to Covid-19 FAQ from Penn Today,FightingQuaker17,"#BEFORE ARRIVAL

**Why do you want me to test at home?**

> All students residing in the United States who plan to be on campus for the fall must have a negative COVID-19 test within 14 days prior to arrival on campus. As a convenience to undergraduates and families, Penn has arranged with a private third-party testing laboratory for a COVID-19 testing kit to be delivered to each domestic student at their home address. This pre-arrival testing strategy is known as Gateway testing.
> 
> Testing students prior to arrival on campus is part of a strategy to prevent students from traveling while infectious. Students with a positive result from the pre-arrival test kit, they should remain in isolation at home for 14 days from their test date. The student should start all classes remotely until they can safely travel to Penn after completing their isolation period.

**Can I get tested at a local urgent care or doctor’s office prior to coming back to campus instead of doing the at-home test kit?**

> To help us make this process as efficient and streamlined as possible, please use the at-home test kit for your initial pre-arrival test. Returning to campus means you’ve agreed to the Student Campus Compact, which includes following the guidelines and instructions provided by the University.

**When are you mailing the tests? When will I receive my test?**

> Test kits will be mailed on Friday, August 7th and students should receive their test between 8/7-8/12.
**
What if I live off-campus, do I still take the at-home test?**

> Yes, ALL undergraduate students residing in the U.S., including those who live off-campus, will receive the at-home kit. If you plan to be on campus at any point this fall semester, you must have a negative COVID-19 test result and quarantine 14 days prior to your first arrival on campus.

**What if I’m already in my off-campus housing and no longer at my home address?**
> 
> Please provide the updated shipping information in Penn InTouch as soon as possible. If you still have concerns about the test reaching your new location, please contact covidtesting@upenn.edu.

**I’m not in the U.S. now, will you still mail me the at-home test kit?**

> International students and others who are not in the U.S. will not receive at home test kits. They will need to take two tests upon arriving on campus.
> 
> If you are arriving to campus as an international student from international destination, please be on the look-out for more information on how to receive testing.
> 

**I’m a graduate or professional student, will I receive the at-home test kit?**

> Only undergraduate students will receive the at-home test kits. Graduate and professional students should be on the look-out for communications either from the Wellness team, your school or program, or the Provost’s office about arranging time for testing. This will be provided free-of-charge to those approved to be on-campus.

**What kind of test will the at-home test kit be?**

> Students will receive a saliva test for the at-home test.

**Do I need to quarantine upon arrival to Penn?**
> 
> While travel does pose a risk, Gateway testing will help mitigate that risk. Students traveling internationally or from current domestic hot spots should make arrangements to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in Philadelphia. This cannot be enforced, but the recommendation is consistent with current federal, state, and local public health guidance.

**What about the parent that is going to accompany me to campus and move-in? Do they need to be tested at home and quarantine, too?**

> Residents are allowed one guest to assist with move in. It is not required that the guest be tested at home, but it is recommended that they also quarantine for 14 days prior to arrival. The guest will need to leave campus once the resident’s timeslot concludes.

**What should I do before coming to campus?**

1. Pack your favorite masks or face coverings.

1. The University recommends 14 days of quarantine prior to traveling to campus. Can we enforce it? No. Is it the responsible thing to do as we continue to navigate these challenging and unprecedented times? Yes. 

1. Be familiar with the Penn Campus Compact. It applies to ALL students, undergraduate and graduate. “All of us in the Penn community have a communal responsibility, as we continue to navigate these challenging and unprecedented times, to balance the health and safety needs of our community with the University’s core missions.”   https://fall-2020-planning.upenn.edu/content/student-campus-compact


#UPON ARRIVAL AT PENN

**When will I be tested at Penn?**

> Students living in College Houses will receive a date and time (two-hour window) to move-in. Those students will also receive an appointment to be tested, on campus at Houston Hall, shortly before their scheduled move in. So, if you are scheduled to move into your room in Harnwell at Noon, you might be scheduled to take your COVID-19 test earlier that morning.

**How will the testing and move-in process work for students in College Houses or Greek Chapter Houses?**

> Students will proceed directly to their move-in following the test. The family member or friend accompanying the student into the College House or Greek Chapter House must leave immediately after all items are in the room.
> 
> Students must then begin their campus quarantine, pending the outcome of their test. We are hopeful that the results will be available within 24 to 48 hours.

**What kind of test will you administer on campus?**

> Penn will administer the anterior nares (lower nostril, less-invasive) nasal test option on campus.

**I am an international student arriving from a country outside of the U.S. or a student arriving from a designated hotspot. Do I have to quarantine between my initial on-campus test (at move-in) and my second on-campus test (5-7 days later)?**
> 
> Yes. International students arriving from outside of the U.S. and students arriving from states that are designated by the Pennsylvania Department of Health as hotspots, public health guidance from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends quarantine for 14 days upon arrival to Philadelphia. To minimize risk of spreading COVID-19, the University will require all international students and students arriving from “hotspot” states to take an additional test within 5-7 days of when their first on-campus test was administered (at move-in). Regardless of result, these students will still be asked to quarantine upon arrival to campus for the full 14 day period.
> 

**What will I do during my campus quarantine? How will I eat?**

> Students in isolation in their rooms will be required to stay primarily behind closed doors, except for their designated bathroom schedule.
> 
> Penn will deliver food to all students in College Houses and Greek Chapter Houses who are quarantining pending their test results. Again, we are hopeful this will be a short period of no more than two days.

**How will the testing and move-in process work for students living off campus?**

> Off-campus students should make plans to have necessary food and medical supplies in their residence prior to their testing. Students living off campus will be assigned a date and time to be tested at Houston Hall.
> 
> Students will proceed to their off-campus residences immediately following this test.
> 
> Off-campus students must begin quarantining in their residence at that time, for the 1-2 day period. Off-campus students must quarantine in their bedrooms for this period, with the exception of careful use of shared kitchen and bathrooms in their residence.
> 
> Penn expects all students to adhere to the same public health requirements, regardless of whether they live on campus or off campus.

**What support will be available for me during my quarantine, whether I live on campus or off campus?**

> Penn resources (Student Health 215-746-3535 and CAPS 215-898-7021) are open and reachable for any student in need during their required quarantine.
> 

**Will I be tested again throughout the semester?**
> 
> In addition to the Gateway testing required for all students coming to campus for the Fall semester, symptomatic testing will occur this fall on an ongoing basis. Right now, public health guidance has testing recommendations for symptomatic individuals or those with contact with a confirmed case. The guidance changes regularly. The best thing to do is to use the PennOpen Pass daily, since it uses the most up to date guidelines or to call Student Health.

**Where can we go to get tested once returning to campus?**

> The University testing site will be in Houston Hall-Hall of Flags.

**Why are you not testing students more?**

> Students will be tested upon return to Penn in the Fall. This is above and beyond what is recommended by CDC. Contacts of confirmed cases are offered testing on Day 7 post-exposure. At this time, broad scale testing of anyone other than confirmed close and high-risk contacts is generally not recommended.  
> 
> The University will be utilizing a combination of public health strategies to reduce the risk of COVID on campus. PennOpen Pass is a digital application that will support the early identification of students, staff, and faculty meeting the criteria for COVID-19 testing.
> 
> Any student who does not feel well or is concerned about their health, should always reach out to Student Health (215-746-3535) to discuss their situation with a medical provider.

**Will there be antibody tests available at Penn?**
> 
> Right now, antibody tests are not recommended because the virus is so new and we’re still learning about it. As this changes, the availability of antibody tests will change. Even if you have had COVID19, you should still wear a mask or face covering, and abide by the rules outlined in the Campus Compact.",10,,1596585432.0,g0djxjz,False,False,1596575415.0,2020-08-04 16:10:15

Update to Covid-19 FAQ from Penn Today,singularreality,"Before going home for Thanksgiving, about a week before or less, you should test and Penn should provide that test for you.  I don't see how you can ""safely"" spend time at home after traveling from Penn or after being in the Penn bubble, despite the precautions.  My suggestion (as perhaps a logical thinker with -0- medical background) is  that you test before you leave and then about one week after you arrive home... (the sweet spot for testing after you are infected begins about 5-7 days from some of the research) and in the interim quarantine and separate yourself from your immunocompromised and older family members.  None of these things are difficult to do (if you can get the tests); except for the first week when you return home and it is a relatively minor inconvenience when you consider the ramification of infecting an older or immunocompromised individuals.

&#x200B;

**I have older or immunocompromised relatives at home. Is it safe for me to travel home after the semester?**

>Yes, after the semester you can safely spend time with older or immunocompromised relatives. Wear face coverings or masks, physically distance, wash your hands often, and clean and sanitizer touched surfaces regularly.",1,,False,g0wxdud,False,False,1596997427.0,2020-08-09 13:23:47
Update to Covid-19 FAQ from Penn Today,FightingQuaker17,"#CONTACT TRACING

**What happens when a student tests positive?**

> First and foremost, no student is ever in trouble or penalized for being sick or exposed to a communicable illness. Student privacy, and the student’s ability to maintain an active role in the public health process, is of utmost importance to us.
> 
> A contact tracer follows up with any student who tests positive to ensure the student isolates and gets the needed healthcare. The contact tracer will also ask the student about their activities leading up to infection and the contacts they may have had. These conversations are thorough, nuanced, and require collaboration between the student and contact tracer.
> 
> The notification of contacts is performed without identifying the student source and notifies other students who have had high-risk exposure.
> 
> One goal of contact tracing is to trace and monitor contacts of infected people. Contact tracers notify students of their exposure through the student medical record.
> 
> The second goal is to support the quarantine of contacts to prevent additional transmission.

**What is a close contact?**
> 
> With COVID-19, close contacts are identified as housemates, roommates, intimate partners, and those who spent 15+ minutes within 6 feet of a confirmed case. That last definition could identify many contacts. In the case of clinical and lab settings, PPE often mitigates the risk of proximity+length of exposure. To ensure this is the case, the case investigation asks very detailed questions about these interactions to ensure the appropriate risk is assigned. These risk levels vary as public health guidance changes; working collaboratively with the contact tracer is vitally important.

**What happens to the close contact?**

> Any close contacts identified as at risk of exposure to a confirmed case are notified to quarantine and offered testing at Day 7 post-exposure. However, for a close contact of a confirmed case, even a negative test on Day 7 post-exposure does NOT eliminate the need for the full 14 day quarantine in most situations. The incubation period for COVID-19 is 2-14 days. Testing on Day 7 post-exposure allows us to capture most new cases related to the initial exposure.

**Do you notify my school about my need to quarantine or isolate?**

> Because we want students to feel empowered to participate in these important public health activities, students are encouraged to notify the School (or program) themselves of their need to be out of class or clinicals. If that is not an option for them, or if they feel uncomfortable doing so, the contact tracers will notify the school on their behalf. School advisors and instructors are also aware of this policy and will not require documentation should a student indicate they are unable to attend class due to illness or isolation.
> 
> There are additional protocols in place for students with in-person clinical requirements: the contact tracers coordinate patient outreach with the school if the student has had recent patient interactions.

#ISOLATION/QUARANTINE

**What is quarantine or isolation?**

>  Quarantine and isolation are public health measures used to reduce or prevent the spread of illness. Isolation refers to separating a sick person with a contagious disease away from others. Quarantine means separating a healthy person or group of healthy people away from others due to exposure to a contagious disease. In both instances, University staff will remain in regular communication with students to support their wellbeing and offer additional virtual resources as appropriate.

**What does quarantine look like?**

> A recommendation to quarantine includes the advice to stay at home, limit the sharing of bathrooms and common areas (e.g. kitchens, living rooms) with others, increase cleaning of common areas, and physically distancing from others in your home or apartment as much as possible. Penn community members who are asked to quarantine should not travel, go to class, work, or participate in any social activities. They should not host friends or small gatherings, and they should not attend small gatherings.
> 
> In quarantine, food and groceries should be ordered online and delivered as much as possible, or have meals and groceries dropped off by friends. Wear a mask or face covering anytime you are not alone.
> 
> Students in quarantine or isolation receive continued care and support from Student Health and CAPS clinicians as needed or requested. Other University services are also made available to the student as needed.

**What does isolation look like?**

> For students living on campus, students will be moved into the isolation facility where they will have their own bathroom and kitchen Depending on capacity, students living off-campus may also be moved into the isolation facility. For all Penn community members off-campus, isolation means staying at home alone in your bedroom except to use the bathroom. All people in isolation have to order food in (Penn Dining meal orders), or ask a friend or roommate to drop off groceries or a meal. Masks or facial coverings must be worn anytime students are outside of the bedroom. Do not travel, go to class, work, or participate in any social activities. Do not host friends or small gatherings. Do not attend small gatherings.
> 
> Students in quarantine or isolation receive continued care and support from Student Health and CAPS clinicians as needed or requested. Other University services are also made available to the student as needed.

**What are my food options while in quarantine or isolation?**

> If you are a first year student, your dining plan is available to use. If you do not have a dining plan, you can use Penn Dining and the meal costs will be charged to your bursar. Students are also able to order food or groceries in. Everyone must wear a mask when outside their room (like going to the front desk to pick up your food).
> 
> If a student or instructor develops COVID and contact tracing indicates that the student was in an in-person class, then will the guidance be that all students from the class will need to self-isolate for 14 days, and will the classroom or building be sanitized?
> 
> It depends! Case investigations are incredibly detailed and nuanced in order to get the most accurate information and to properly assess risk.
> 
> In this scenario, only that individual and their close contacts would be notified to quarantine or isolate. Close contacts would be identified after a contact tracing interview done by someone our public health team at Penn; close contacts are defined as individuals who were closer than 6 feet apart for more than 15 minutes. Based on the public health rules put forth for in-person instruction this Fall, namely requiring face coverings and respecting distancing of more than 6 feet, no one in attendance during class would be deemed a close contact. As for classroom sanitizing, this would also not be necessary as surface transmission is mitigated by our enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols.

**If someone get tested positive in your hall, does everyone in the hall need to be quarantined for 14 days.**
> 
> It depends! Case investigations are incredibly detailed and nuanced in order to get the most accurate information and to properly assess risk. Everyone living on campus will have their own bedroom to accommodate physical distancing, to increase safety, and to reduce exposures.",4,,False,g0dk92h,False,False,1596575554.0,2020-08-04 16:12:34

Update to Covid-19 FAQ from Penn Today,FightingQuaker17,"#PENNOPEN PASS

**What is the purpose of PennOpen Pass?**

> PennOpen Pass is part of Penn’s strategy to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the Penn community. The purpose of this program is to:
> 
1.      Identify individuals whose health may be at risk and/or may pose health risks to others due to COVID-19
1.      To ensure that individuals at risk receive appropriate assistance and follow up, which may include COVID-19 testing, self-isolation, contact tracing, and medical care
1.      To monitor trends related to COVID-19 to ensure timely allocation of resources for campus health and safety.

**Do I have to use the app PennOpen Pass?**
> 
> The app is actually a daily symptom check called PennOpen Pass. It does not have to be done on an app. The entire community is healthier when PennOpen Pass is used daily—even on the days you’re NOT coming to campus.

**Is my data secure?**
> 
> Please see the full data security statement here: https://pennopen.med.upenn.edu/privacy.pdf . We are not tracking your activities through PennOpen Pass.

#CAMPUS LIFE

**Who would a student contact if he/she are experiencing symptoms?**

> PennOpen Pass should be used every day. If you receive a green pass and would like to discuss your symptoms with a medical provider, Student Health is always available to you: 215-746-3535.

**Why can’t we hang out in groups of X people or more?**

> COVID-19 isn’t gone; we are all learning to co-exist with COVID19. Length of time and proximity to the virus increase your risk for infection. Keeping groups small allows for appropriate physical distancing. You should always wear your mask when around others. Penn students must abide by the regulations established by local, state, and federal public health agencies as well. Currently, those public health guidelines restrict large gatherings through February 28, 2021.

**I have older or immunocompromised relatives at home. Is it safe for me to travel home after the semester?**

> Yes, after the semester you can safely spend time with older or immunocompromised relatives. Wear face coverings or masks, physically distance, wash your hands often, and clean and sanitizer touched surfaces regularly.

**How will labs and more hands-on oriented classes be safely conducted?**
> 
>  In person classes are depopulating class sizes (e.g. limited seating and bigger rooms) to allow for appropriate physical distancing. In places where that’s not possible, appropriate PPE will be worn.

**Will students be able to access libraries?**
> 
>  With a green pass on your PennOpen Pass? Yes!

**Can we still go eat with friends in a dining hall or other campus café.**

> Yes, but indoor dining will be limited and physical distancing will be enforced. Eating and drinking remain incredibly high risk events because of the respiratory secretions produced while eating or drinking and because you have to take your mask or face covering off to do them. In ALL instances, it is imperative students maintain a 6ft distance while eating or drinking.

**What will the safety routine be for office hours? Will in-person meetings with counselors/advisors/professors be permitted?**

> This will vary. Many of these meetings can happen virtually. Additionally, the state of Pennsylvania is mandating work from home as much as possible to help keep everyone safe.

**How will social distancing work between classes in crowded spaces like Locust Walk?**
> 
> You should always wear a mask or face covering in spaces where you cannot physically distance, like a busy Locust Walk between classes.

**How do I stay healthy?**

> To continue to keep yourself healthy and well, follow these tips:
> 
1.     Wear a facial covering at all times when you leave your residence.
1.      Please remember to maintain (6 feet) physical distance from others whenever possible.
1.      Stay home if you are feeling unwell. If you are not feeling better after 24 hours, seek medical guidance.
1.      Use good hand hygiene: Wash hands with soap and warm water for 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
1.      Limit the spread of germs and illness: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve or elbow. Avoid sharing food, drinks, utensils, cups, vapes/JUULs, etc.

**The most up to date information on University operations and guidance can be found here:**

> https://fall-2020-planning.upenn.edu

**What are current University of Pennsylvania actions to protect the health of our community?**

* Anyone who has not been self-isolating for at least 2 weeks prior to returning to campus must do so for 14 days before resuming their campus activities.
*     Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), anyone who is returning from international travel is required to self isolate for 14 days from their entrance into the United States.
*     Per the Pennsylvania Health Department, anyone entering a business in the state of Pennsylvania that serves the public is required to wear a mask.
*     Anyone on campus is required to wear a face mask.
*     Anyone who is not feeling well should refrain from coming to work or school and seek medical guidance as indicated.
*     Anyone who has had close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case must stay at home and self-isolate for 14 days after their last contact with the case even if they do not develop symptoms.
*     Contact tracing involves identifying anyone who has an infectious disease (the case) and their contacts (people who may have been exposed) and working with them to prevent the further transmission of the disease. For COVID-19, this includes asking cases to isolate and contacts to quarantine at home voluntarily.

**What should I do if I have a cough, fever, or shortness of breath and/or I want to get tested?**

>    Anyone with cough, fever, shortness of breath, or a known exposure to someone with COVID-19, should call Student Health Service at 215-746-3535. Our medical providers can walk you through that process.",6,,1596585382.0,g0dkt1j,False,False,1596575789.0,2020-08-04 16:16:29
Update to Covid-19 FAQ from Penn Today,closeencownter,"I think that's reasonable which is why I wrote the 2nd paragraph but the school doesn't take into account that some intl students are either in the US already or will be driving across the border, whereas some American students will be spending tons of time at the airport as well. Plus the whole sequence of testing seems off. If the school is accounting for people getting sick on the way back to school, wouldn't the 1st test for both domestic and international students be useless? (since positives take a day or two to show up)

Honestly, I'd much rather be sent the testing kit at home than take one more test on campus. It may sound paranoid but I don't think the school will handle 10,000 or more people unmasking in an enclosed space well, even though it'll be spread out over a couple of days. I'm not offended that the school is testing us more, but rather that I think the school hasn't thought much beyond the first step of ""let's test the students""",1,,False,g0ekztb,False,False,1596595594.0,2020-08-04 21:46:34

It's totally okay that it took a while to find your friend group - I don't think I fully settled into Penn until mid-November or so.

* [SelfControl](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) is a Mac app that you can use to block distracting websites. This site has saved me many times from going down the Facebook/Twitter wormhole during midterms and finals season.

* Color-coded calendars are huge. I always marked my exams in red so that I would never be surprised by an impending deadline and set reminders for when things are due.

* To-do lists are also massively helpful as well, especially for large papers and projects. By breaking down things into manageable tasks, I was really able to keep my stress levels down and stay on track for finishing things - especially during my thesis.

A new phenomenon - The new Off Campus Campus / Unintended Consequences?,singularreality,"Yes, the safety of individual students and students in general depends upon their behaviors, but also access to testing and actually being in an environment that is conducive to their health and safety.  I partially agree with you.  And, this is why the campus pact should be recognized and followed by those living off campus.  This is a very complex issue.  When a student stays home, are they in quarantine?  No, of course not.  Whatever their home situation is and wherever they may be becomes a baseline for whether they will get infected, are infected already and who they will be exposed to.  In addition, and this is your point with which I mostly agree, behaviors are critically important.  Seniors, for example  do want to socialize with their friends before they graduate.   Instead of living with their family, maybe they are in an apartment, frat house or group home.  They should not party, they should distance with their friends.  I am already aware of many of these students that you say are mostly there to party and go to food trucks.  Yes, they do want to socialize with friends, and house mates.   Yet I know that some of them (and I hope most of them) are distancing, are masking, will NOT go to any parties, will not go to a gym  Some are there to work a job or be in a lab that they arranged before hybrid was cancelled.  Some entered into housing contracts that they cannot cancel.   I am not an infectious disease expert, but staying home surrounded by family members and neighbors and students going to HS and grade school and other friends is not necessarily much safer than being off campus -- both are not a controlled environment and success will depend upon numerous factors.   And by going and living at home you might engage in reasonable behaviors and still infect a vulnerable family member.  If you are not home, you are not gonna infect mom, dad or grandma/pa. Obviously,  classes and gyms and choruses and plays and museums and libraries are all petri dishes... which is why they were cancelled or limited even before the hybrid towel was thrown down.  Staying home raises other concerns unless you voluntarily quarantine...  Your family members have  jobs, they shop inside, they get haircuts, small gatherings occur anyway, your family members go to school, some go to the gym and you are exposed to them and have to deal with their behaviors too.   There is a huge off campus campus and all part of it should follow the campus pact and adhere to local and CDC guidelines.... but time will tell as to whether other schools who have gone a different route, and are able to have adequate testing, can keep their students safer and still have a hybrid situation.  So far UNC could not do it.  Let's see how Tulane does, Richmond, etc.... Unchartered territory like this makes guinea pigs of us all.",1,,False,g1xj63o,True,False,1597710858.0,2020-08-17 19:34:18

Regardless of the number though. It intuitively makes sense that having separated clusters of 5-30 individuals without contact between them would be safer than one huge campus cluster that can suddenly blow up. Imagine a scenario where an asymptomatic person goes to either. In the separated clusters scenario everyone in that cluster will get into contact with that person and that’s about it. But in the Penn scenario the entire campus is threatened. It’s also more likely in the penn scenario since it sees more people coming in and out.

Doing contact tracing will be easier for the smaller clusters as well since everyone knows each other. Contact tracing will be harder on campus. Do you keep track of all the people sitting beside you in class? In the cafeteria? etc. Small things can also carry a small risk of transferring the virus.

FROM THE PENN WEBSITE We remain committed to the health and safety of our community on and off campus. As such, we recognize that some students who may travel to Philadelphia to continue to learn may inadvertently carry the disease. To address this, and in light of the public health impact of students coming to Philadelphia from various regions of the United States and the world, we will be offering any student who will be learning from Philadelphia the opportunity to be tested upon arrival and again seven days later, at no cost to them. This will allow us to quickly identify positive cases and trigger the requisite isolation in order to prevent the spread of the disease. Should students develop any symptoms during the semester, we will be offering COVID-19 testing to all members of the Penn community in the Hall of Flags. In addition, we ask all students who will be traveling to Philadelphia from states with a high incidence of COVID-19 to adhere to the recommended 14-day quarantine upon arrival to Pennsylvania.

As for George Washington, the precedents he set for the America is overwhelmingly ""good"" for the ""bad"" he did (these words are totally subjective of course). Setting the two term precedent rather than easily choosing to become a king for life himself, warning about political party rivalries, establishing the Cabinet to create unity among the political factions, and needless to say fighting for the expansion of liberty for American colonists as the leading military general. There is often a skeleton in the closet though, in this case Washington's unfortunate involvement with slavery during the times where it was more or less the status quo.

How do Greek Life people do it?,FightingQuaker17,"Wasn't in greek life but was in a bunch of clubs and liked to socialize, so can speak to general time-management (at least for social science majors in the college).

Key thing is knowing what grade you are comfortable with and in each class realizing what kind of work is required to get there. Each class is different, and depending on what the syllabus looks like and how the class is structured, in many classes you can easily get away with an A without doing any readings, so long as you write really good papers or study hard for exams. In other classes you figure out that you only need to do X% of the reading every week, while still others you realize that you need to do EVERYTHING to get the grade you want. 

It's a skill that takes some time to learn, but it's pretty invaluable. Key point is that it's rare that you need to do everything to get the grade you want in a class.",41,,False,g5p4qz8,False,False,1600434092.0,2020-09-18 08:01:32

B) Accept you’re gonna get less sleep. It sucks. But sometimes you’re gonna go to sleep at 1 or 2 and wake up at 6. That’s the price you pay. 

C) Time management time management time management. Do your work when you need to and when you’re free, not just when you have to. And really do work, don’t just sit with your boys and pretend to work in the library. 

D) Greek life also helps with school. Knowing people who have taken the class, getting past tests and homework, and knowing people in your classes is all a massive boon and can radically cut down the amount of time it takes to do work.",13,,False,g5q69fb,False,False,1600452824.0,2020-09-18 13:13:44

How do Greek Life people do it?,Equivalent-Okra-8524,"I am not in greek life (so idk how relevant my opinion is for your question) but I am quite social and have a lot of friends in greek life. I am doing CS/STEM-related stuff and I have been doing quite well GPA-wise the past semesters. I am extroverted and socializing definitely makes me more energetic. So in my opinion, the way it works is: I work really hard over the week and see my Saturday/Friday night as just time to recover from a stressful week. It almost \*helps\* my productivity because as an extrovert, socializing is a need, and I don't meet that need when I am doing work by myself the whole week, and being with friends at a party has historically helped me hit refresh and not be burned out. I don't party 2-3 times per week and I did in freshman year and it hurt my grades a bit. But as long as you prioritize your work, it is doable.

What I don't know is how people do work while also rushing/pledging, but I know of a lot of people with 4.0 GPAs who also happen to be in greek life. I think they just draw the line really appropriately and that works.

For CIS/STEM/difficult classes, the general advice I get from professors is: if you read ahead and start your homework right when it is released, the stress would be more manageable. Also, backlogs happen, and you have to pull out of your usual schedule and end the backlog ASAP. Consistency and staying on top of your work is key, otherwise the whole semester gets more and more stressful. It has actually been 10x easier for me when I do as little work as possible for a CIS class, but I do it in a timely manner and seek help during OH.

By the way, in freshman year, I did not use OH at all because I thought I should understand everything by myself. Now that I am a TA for a class, a lot of people come to me and literally just say ""I haven't watched lecture in a week because I messed up"" and I am able to help quite a lot. If they never asked, that couldn't happen. I know freshman year is stressful but if you seek help, you can definitely manage coursework and also enjoy college (although that's an unpopular opinion).

How do Greek Life people do it?,FightingQuaker17,"I hear that, it's a good point. During my time I tried to optimize for both. There were classes though where I didn't care too much for the knowledge and focused on grades, and others where I put it far more work than I needed to because I was genuinely interested in the subject, or knew that the knowledge was necessary to take me to where I wanted to go. Still other times where I probably should have focused more on the knowledge aspect but was happy with a grade I could get as it let me prioritize other activities (fun, clubs, internships, etc.) and I figured the GPA boost was more important than what I knowledge I would gain if I spent X more hours on the class.

Looking back now many years later (I graduated 2013), there are only a few classes where the knowledge I gained still materially matter in my daily life, while the GPA I got (as well as the reading/writing skills--but not necessarily the material I read or wrote about) helped tremendously in getting to where I am today. Then again it was only last night where I was reading something that opened my eyes a lot, only to realize that I read something similar in college and it simply didn't take (though I wish it did).

How do Greek Life people do it?,InternationalCupcake,"Definitely a deeper topic re: credentialism for sure, and I take your point. I probably should not have proposed the re-frame as a binary, either - both approaches have their time and place, and both can applied simultaneously with varying weighting. I'm also likely an outlier in how I have approached school. 

I will say another point in favor of focusing optimization on knowledge is that the energy directed is towards an outcome that is actually within the student's control. End of the day, it's up to professors to assign grade and as we all know, that can be a bit of a crapshoot from class to class. I think mental health and motivation can tend to suffer a bit when striving towards a goal, the achievement of which is not within one's control.

I think the two optimization paths are also interconnected but not strictly equivalent in terms of synergy. That is, I've seen a lot of students that optimize for grades and come out learning very little. On the other hand, I don't think I've seen a single student who has optimized for knowledge and come out with a bad grade.",4,,False,g5pxh2c,False,False,1600448608.0,2020-09-18 12:03:28

Second, the school has as much of a support system for those who are floundering as you make of it. No, nobody is going to step forward & ask if everything is okay because you've gotten a string of Ds all semester. Maybe that should be changed, idk. I waited a year for someone to ""save me"" & it didn't happen. I had to slowly build my own support system. Professors, TAs, & tutors are willing to help if you let them know what's going on. As bad as the wait is for CAPS, & for all their faults, once I found a good counselor & psych, I made strides of improvement. Switch advisors. Let someone know shit is hitting the fan.

Subject: Pickup Information for Packed and Stored Belongings

Dear XX,

With the recent changes related to the Fall semester, options for belonging retrieval have also changed.  For residents who have not already picked up their belongings from the movers, here are the options related to pickup of items that were packed up in the residences in Spring 2020. 

Storage 

Penn undergraduate students who are not going to live on campus in the Fall can opt to keep their belongings in storage at Penn's expense through January 2021.  Graduate students who do not have an assignment in Sansom Place East can opt to do the same.  Students who wish to take advantage of this option do not need to do anything to opt in. 

Direct Pickup from the Movers 

Any resident who wishes to can reach out to their mover to make arrangements to pick up all of their items from the mover warehouse.  There is no cost for this pickup.

On-Campus Undergraduate Students and Returning Graduate Students 

Undergraduates who are living on campus and Graduate Students returning to Sansom Place will have their belongings placed in their Fall 2020 rooms on or before their arrival date on campus. 

Residents Living Off-Campus in Philadelphia 

Former residents living off-campus in Philadelphia in Fall 2020 can opt into retrieving their belongings from the Tennis Center on specified dates.  Here’s what you need to know about this retrieval process: 

Individuals who want to take advantage of this program will need to reach out directly to the movers to make arrangements by Friday, August 21st at 1 pm EST. Movers will issue timeslots to residents to aid ensuring proper physical distancing and smooth operations. If you need the email address of your moving company, please contact [living@upenn.edu](mailto:living@upenn.edu).

The dates for this pickup will be August 25th to August 29th and August 31st to September 1st. 

For physical distancing purposes, individuals will need a motor vehicle to do this pickup and will be encouraged to stay in their car during the pickup (movers will load the vehicle). 

People will be spread out and will need to conform to the timeslots they are given by the movers to limit the number of retrievals per hour. 

Note that there will be no facilities to collect used boxes on the premises and residents will need to wait to unpack until after they have left the premises. If you have questions about your belongings after you have unpacked them, please contact [living@upenn.edu](mailto:living@upenn.edu) and we will direct you to appropriate resources.

The location for this pickup will be the Tennis Center near Penn Park.  You will access the Tennis Center making a right off Chestnut St. at 31st St.  Below is a diagram of this pickup point and the logistics associated with this pickup: 

For students who applied for the Housing Exception, we expect that you will receive a status update on Wednesday. 

Residents with any questions about any of these processes are encouraged to reach out to [living@upenn.edu](mailto:living@upenn.edu).

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Our best,

Residential Services

Do you think Spring would be online as well?,singularreality,"I believe the Spring will be Hybrid but I am 0-1 as I thought the same for this fall.  What will change to enable a partial re-opening (not a full reopening unfortunately)?  It comes down to 4 critical categories, the first two challenges, Penn admittedly believed it could not manage for this fall (testing and quarantines).

1. Testing and Contact tracing capacity.  Penn must secure sufficient testing capacity and turnaround times to curtail any spread and identify infecting students before school starts.  Testing must be offered before arrival on campus, upon arrival on campus and 5-7 days after. Penn admitted it was having some problems with this (which is frustrating). Then there will need to be a committed way to isolate those infected and their closest contacts for a requisite period.
2. Procedures in place to allow for 14 day quarantine for anyone from a ""hot spot"" or who tests positive.  Penn announced that this was a daunting problem that they could not manage for the fall.  If Penn cannot manage and figure out how to quarantine those that need quarantine, then no Spring on campus learning.  This problem requires massive cooperation and faithfulness to both the campus pact and whatever rules regarding behavior must be followed by the ENTIRE STUDENT BODY.  The problem also requires securing more specifically earmarked housing for quarantined students and the planning would need to start now to make it work. It costs money and it requires some sacrifice.
3. Student Body Behavior and Accountability.  The number of students across the nation such as at Syracuse, UNC, Notre D., etc that have been seen engaging in unbridled partying and  gatherings is a warning to all.  Many of these behaviors (particularly so far at UNC) have directly result in a return to online learning.  Others on this site have pointed to parting going on off campus this Summer (although I have seen responsible conduct when on and around campus).  This is YOUR college experience.  If you want to have it or some semblance of it, you need to comply, period.  If you don't want to comply, on campus or off campus DO NOT COME TO PENN on campus or off. Those on campus now, must comply with the campus pact and get tested at least twice (upon their arrival and a few weeks later, minimally). Just because you are off campus, while the challenges may be greater, you gotta mask, social distance, wash etc... and all off campus houses, frat houses, apartments should set up rules that keep everyone as safe as possible.  This is YOUR education, decide if you want to have it or not and if you do, start putting peer pressure on your more self-indulgent friends to work together. Whatever you are doing, shopping, have dinner with a friend or protesting, no excuse for not taking precautions.
4. How the Colleges that have a Hybrid model have faired.   If Tulane, Cornell, Notre Dame, Richmond  and others have managed to contain the virus, limit exposure to the greater college community and have generally had a safe semester (a difficult thing to define) then these initial test case schools will provide a framework for Penn that Penn can hopefully improve upon.  If these experiments fail miserably, then I don't see why other schools will want to reopen until the infection rates are way down.

If there are still social distancing measures by August (there will be), there’s just no way to ethically and reasonably enforce them on a college campus.

big lectures will be Strongly Suggested or required to be online, or will require sitting ~~my dick length~~ 6 feet away from your classmates, or only held on one of the 2-3 days.

There are massive economic implications for keeping schools closed which affects more than just the .1%. Many people in West Philadelphia rely on economic activity from Penn students. Most schools can not afford to not have tuition from a semester. Penn has a sizable endowment. Most do not.

I hate how this virus is becoming politicized. The current protests are ridiculous. However, it’s been 2 months. How can we expect people to remain inside for 5-7 more months? Won’t work.

speculations about fall 2020 amid COVID crisis,FightingQuaker17,"> I’m really hopeful that there will be herd immunity by the spring.

I don't see this happening without a vaccine unless millions die by the spring. Even if a vaccine is somehow developed in time by January, I doubt herd immunity will exist based on the number of people willing to forgo a vaccine. Not even to mention the complications with different strains of the virus appearing. 

> And I think when it starts getting to the point where deaths from poverty/suicide start to rival COVID deaths and certain institutions are facing economic collapse, cities/states will open regardless.

It saddens me that this is the binary choice that is always presented: Either have people die from poverty or save the economic system by having people die from disease. A lot of unnecessary death has already and will occur because this country has to try and hold on to the economic system that was already broken before the pandemic. 

> Truthfully it is not a disease that affects healthy/young people.

That's not entirely accurate for a couple of reasons. The first being that young people can definitely be affected. The second being that the word ""healthy"" is used very loosely. Literally the majority of Americans have underlying conditions that are associated with increased risk to complications with Covid. Finally, as you know, the university does not solely consist of healthy young people and requires staff of a diversity of ages and health conditions.",6,,False,fqlzbac,False,False,1589468786.0,2020-05-14 10:06:26

How do people get into relationships?,saiaiai,"I think right now is a hard time to find someone given the current situation, but that being said, I am sure dating apps are booming right now. If you aren’t already on them, I would join some of them. That way you can at least start putting yourself out there and talking to others. I’m not sure how people are “going on dates” right now (short of those dating app commercials, showing people video chatting and watching movies or ordering dinner and eating together). 

The other thing I want to say is that you do not need a relationship to be happy or to define yourself. Having a significant other is not like having a commodity. Being in a relationship should be something special because you are opening yourself up to another person in ways that are much deeper. I had several friends throughout college who often forgot that being in a relationship was not necessary and would date whomever showed interest. That isn’t to say don’t date people - I just wouldn’t jump into any relationship all willy nilly just to BE in a relationship.",34,,False,g6h94bd,False,False,1600988408.0,2020-09-24 18:00:08

That being said, the best relationships are formed on the basis of friendships..become friends first! Without that basis of trust, inside jokes, etc, you don’t have a real connection to build off of. Focus on making friends first, and finding ppl u vibe with. Relationships should be, imo, best friends + benefits.

Right now the #1 thing to do if you're lonely is to *get friends*, and I've written lots and lots about that on this account. Just go dig through my comment history, you'll find it (DMs open if u got questions about that).

Friends form a solid foundation from which you can aim at things like rships more easily and not have it wreck u if u get shot down.

I thought it'd be neat to go ""fully Ivy League"" and join a ""secret"" society, and most importantly, I felt very aligned with what they stood for. The only cool thing about that interview was seeing a part of College Hall many don't get to see. 

Four to five members of the Society spend an hour berating you, basically. Anything I answered, I was laughed at and very purposefully made to feel dumb. Everything I said was wrong. I was in tears throughout the entire thing. At the end, they ask you to say one nasty thing about each of the members that just interviewed you. Being forced to tell someone that I thought they were ugly, or they were too fat, messed me up. I didn't like it. I left that place sobbing, and they didn't care. I immediately withdrew my application.

club rejections are painful,johnathanjones1998,"Hi current philo member here. To clarify a few things:   
\* I've been interviewing applicants for about 2 years now. I do not recall other members berating applicants. Our line of questioning can get pointed and critical, but that's expected in any line of questioning that involves a deeply ethical/philosophical question that does not have an expected ""right"" answer (we want to see if your logic can hold up or not). That being said, if someone uses faulty logic/false equivalence during an interview, we'll be quick to point that out which can be disconcerting to people who don't engage in these discussions regularly.  
\* If you were crying during the interview, the members should have stopped. I don't know about what the society looked like 10 years go, but now we have post-interview questionnaires and consistently get rated 4-5/5 for ""comfort"" level in interviews. I have no idea why an interview would go that far as to cause emotional trauma to an individual and I haven't seen it during my time in the society.  
\* The ""insult"" portion has been removed from the interview. Some people a decade or two ago thought it'd be nice to have applicants lash out at interviewers for a stress relief type thing, but it was just an additional stressor on the applicant.  


Caution of survivorship bias here: but i found the process to be remarkably meritocratic ie based off of your own efforts + thinking style. I never found myself having to kiss up to other members/interviewers during the application process. I never found myself competing with others (as a member, we are explicitly told to not compare an applicant to another applicant + to ignore previous applications to the society...so it is entirely possible we admit all of the applicants in any given semester and that has happened several times before). In addition, the person(s) in charge of the application process is remarkably willing to give feedback on what to improve so you can apply the next time around. So I found it to be the antithesis of penn club culture in that manner.

Has anyone received their at-home COVID test kit yet?,WHOAHOAAHOAHS,"I haven't heard of anyone that has. My family has alerts on from Fedex and UPS to let us know if we have any packages coming to our house once they get shipped. Also we have it for USPS but it only lets you know like 2-3 days before it's going to arrive. Given that they probably would've used USPS to ship this out to 10k+ students, I don't see it coming any time soon given that the USPS has been backed up for two months. Packages sent priority 2 day are coming in a week now. If someone were to get their covid test late say next Monday, I think that it's cutting it close in terms of giving students 14 days until the first day of class to self quarantine before coming to Penn (esp assuming they test positive). Also, say someone has a move in time of Aug 24th, I don't think families will be happy if Penn says they have to wait a few more days to come to campus because they got the test late when flights and stuff have already been booked.

He also went to a nearby Ivy. I very much prioritized the existence of his social life because I knew how important it was to success in college. I had a very social freshman/sophomore year at Penn, but a much quieter last two years because I was premed. I will say that during those years, it was hard to not have him by my side whenever I wanted, especially as a few of my best friends leaned into their relationships. In general though, you gotta chart your own path. I only did one major time sink club at Penn, and I had always wished I had done one more because I loved the social support I received from that club. But I was also invested in my research, so that was a premed choice- nothing to do with my relationship. Meanwhile, my boyfriend was CIS so he did tons of clubs and had more of a social life than I did. You’ll have to learn to manage this FOMO and manage your priorities as a premed.

How many of you are dating/in relationships/still together with people from HS?,tacticalnookincoming,"I’m a rising junior and I have been with my boyfriend for 6 years now. We went to the same high school, which is 1.5 hours away from Penn. While he does not go to school within driving distance (large school in the Midwest), he flies to the Philly airport when he comes home, and we are fortunate to see each other quite a bit. We also text every day and call each other around 4-5 times a week.

You’ll hear a lot about the hookup culture at Penn, but i have never felt left out of the social scene or college life in general because of my relationship. We are both in clubs at our colleges (ex. I am in Bloomers, a political club, and an academic association, and this has been very manageable). Academically, both of us take rigorous course loads and value our academic success very highly, while also maintaining our relationship.

One thing I will say is that in order to turn your high school relationship into a college or adult relationship, you should both ensure that you understand the reason for staying together. In high school, many relationships are about fun/doing things together/hanging out with a friend group. In a college or adult relationship, especially an LDR, you will individually face new challenges and experiences - difficult classes, a new job, hard decisions - and it won’t always be easy to put yourself in his shoes, or vice versa. You want to make sure he’s the one who will support you when these challenges and decisions come into your life, and also that you are ready to be there for him and help him in that way. This is something you two can reevaluate together and individually as you go through college, but it is definitely worth noting and thinking about.

How many of you are dating/in relationships/still together with people from HS?,MRC1986,"Gonna take a chance on providing some hopefully wise advice as a person who's a bit older (but I still feel young haha!), and has already gone through undergrad and grad school.

At the ripe Millennial age of 33, I do know a few couples around my age from college who first entered a relationship in high school and it lasted all the way through college and now fully into adulthood.  They are among the most loving and committed couples that I know.  The two men I know from my undergrad fraternity (I attended Rutgers University for undergrad), and their now wives were not at Rutgers, but close by at other NJ schools.  Apart, but not super far away; they saw each other frequently.  So, it absolutely can work out even with a relationship that blossomed at fairly young age in high school.

However, the overwhelming majority of folks that I know who are married met their spouses in college itself, or afterword, many times through a post-grad program or through other means.  I've attended so many weddings of couples that met in my grad program at Penn, which means they met around 22-25 years old, some even later.  You become much more certain of what you're looking for in a partner.

Penn students are super ambitious, and you will fine tune your interests and experiences in college.  And I think that greatly impacts the type of person you may wish for a partner.  Even the most mature high school senior will further mature in college and beyond.

Ultimately, if you want to keep going strong, go for it!  You don't have to live up to modern standards of ""no one actually marries their high school bf/gf anymore"", because it does still happen.  But don't feel devastated if it doesn't work out, because so many of my friends met their life partner well after high school.

Added bonus, who even knows if you or him will be on campus in the fall because of coronavirus.  If both of you are remote then you can continue to grow your relationship at home.",3,,False,fvhbh8d,False,False,1592691007.0,2020-06-20 17:10:07

How many of you are dating/in relationships/still together with people from HS?,publu123,"My freshman year was a hoot cuz I lived in Hill and had a great hall. Sophomore year started really bad cuz Gen Chem and physics hit me really hard and I was depressed, but joining a performing arts group and solidifying my 3-4 gal pals from my freshman year helped-the rest of my hall just became acquaintances sadly. My last 2 years at Penn we’re just eat, sleep, research, rehearsal, study, repeat- I was really hell bent on getting a good GPA for med school. That’s when FOMO really hit. But here’s what I can tell you from the other side: I still make monthly calls with my best friends from college, I work with one of them, I see friends from my club that lived in Philly...and I’m satisfied with what I achieved academically at Penn. It was hard, but I prioritized what I wanted from my experience. My friends are really supportive of my goals (none of them are premed- thank god!), and I advise that you find friends who are supportive too. You just need to really stick to your values and manage expectations of yourself. College is one part of a long life. Try to make some good memories, but don’t get hung up on that- you also need to set yourself for a great future!

Edit: it should be noted that I’m an introvert at heart in the sense that I only need 4-5 friends to keep me alive. At Penn, if you include acquaintances, it was more like 10 people. But the typical Penn student seems to maintain dozens of friendships. It’s crazy. I envied them so much. But ultimately, not everyone is built for that, or even wants that. It was only after college when the spotlight was gone that I realized I didn’t need so much social stimulation, and I think a lot of Penn alumni would agree. This goes back to managing your expectations. Try to nurture one great relationship, maybe 2 or 3. If the rest come naturally, that’s awesome, you’re a lucky one.

We are writing to keep you updated on new developments in our response to the global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). While there is a high level of uncertainty as the disease spreads around our country and the world, it is absolutely clear that we, along with all other universities, have a responsibility to institute new mitigation practices of social distancing to help stem that spread. These mitigation practices must prudently limit travel as well as gatherings of large groups and occasions involving extended amounts of time in close proximity. As a result, here are the actions that we are currently taking:

**We are** **prohibiting** **all future University-related travel, both domestic and international, at least until April 17, unless expressly approved by the Provost.**

* We also strongly discourage all members of the Penn community from any personal travel, which could result in quarantine upon your return. Anyone currently traveling on University-affiliated business will be able to return to campus.

**We are curtailing large University events, at least until April 17.**

* We strongly recommend that meetings or events of 100 people or more be cancelled or postponed. We also strongly recommend the use of teleconferencing, group chats, or live streaming as alternatives to in-person gatherings. 
* We strongly discourage all University meetings that include participants from other cities and countries, even if fewer than 100 people.
* Penn Admissions has cancelled all on-campus admitted student programs scheduled for April, including Quaker Days and Multicultural Scholars Previews. Our Admissions team will offer web-based and other innovative virtual programs to welcome admitted students and respond to questions. There will be more details about these revised plans in time for the announcement of admissions decisions later this month.
* Penn Medicine, due to the high level of caution associated with the health system, has prohibited all faculty, students, postdocs, and staff of both the Perelman School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania Health System from participating in large gatherings, including all conferences in the US and abroad, as well as any Penn Medicine conferences that include participants from outside Penn.

**We are preparing to move** **classes** **online** **in order to prepare for all possible scenarios**.

* We are working with deans and faculty members to prepare for the likelihood of some (or possibly all) remote and virtual instruction after Spring Break. As the spread of the virus is fast-changing, we will update the community later this week with more definitive guidance. 

**We** **have** **launched** **a** [**comprehensive website**](https://coronavirus.upenn.edu/) with updated information for every member of the Penn community.

We greatly appreciate your partnership in this important and urgent effort. We are committed to sustaining our core educational mission even in the face of this unexpected global health crisis, and we are confident that we can count on every member of our Penn community to work alongside us. We will continue to update you as more information emerges.

How long to find your group?,Ninjaboi333,"It takes some degree of luck. I know some people got close w their freshmen hallmates and that has continued on. Personally I met one of my good friends by chance at Wharton orientation when I happened to sit next to him. Aside from that, clubs was a big part of me finding friends - specifically first semester, one of the cultural clubs I was a part of (I was one of the only freshmen for the first semester, but more joined on in second semester during our culture show practices) and a dance group I was in.

I feel like I really hit my stride socially at beginning of sophomore year where by being involved in those two clubs I was exposed to other people in similar clubs (other cultural groups and performing arts groups) that I made more friends. That first friend I made also helped me meet more of his friends in sophomore year (weird coincidences where his friends were also in the groups adjacent to what I was doing so I saw them a bunch).

I'll also say a lot of people join Greek like in the spring semester for the reasons you're asking. I didn't personally join a frat early on, but I did end up joining Alpha Phi Omega (service frat so only technically Greek) senior year cuz I knew a lot of people in there already. I know people who joined their first  semester as a good way to meet people (and do service). 

The thing about clubs is that even if you join them for one reason (developing a skill or accomplishing some pre professional goal), you do end up just spending time w them outside of meetings for social things and making jokes and getting to know them which can lead to friendships. This year alone I've been to three weddings of people I've met through these clubs, and still hang out with them after college in the real world.",5,,False,eyp5975,False,False,1567290517.0,2019-08-31 17:28:37

For example, I have to read a lot of Shakespeare for my classes right now, so I'll ask people to read the plays with me, which ends up being really fun because we act out the parts together.

Another thing that might help is to look into therapy. Your lack of interest or motivation could be due to depression, or another mental health issue.

When do we have to decide if we are coming back to campus or not?,thredditread,"You should have gotten an email from Residential Services on 6/25. They'd like you to cancel as soon as possible on Campus Express. I suspect after that, they're planning to let others know about their housing in mid-July, once they hear from cancellers. 

Here's the paste of the email that my daughter (rising sophomore) got:

The University recently announced its plans for Fall Semester. We understand you may have a lot of questions as you are thinking about your options, so we wanted to reach out to you specifically regarding your on-campus housing with what you need to know at this time.

As a returning second-year student who completed the assignment process, you will have housing on campus. The University has provided guidance that all residents will have their own private bedrooms (no shared bedroom spaces) and no more than 6 students will be assigned to the same bathroom. In order to follow these guidelines, our Housing Occupancy team is currently identifying spaces where students are sharing a bedroom and where those students can be relocated.

For our returning undergraduates, this means that it is very likely that you or your roommate(s) will need to relocate to a different assignment on campus in order to adhere to de-densifying protocols. We will make every effort to honor mutual roommate requests by assigning you in either the same suite, floor or building. We will also do our best to honor Program Community requests.

In recognition of the changes to the academic calendar, the room rates for the 2020-2021 Academic Year will be $4320 for Fall Semester and $5507 for Spring Semester. The lower rate for Fall Semester reflects the fact that students will leave campus at Thanksgiving Break.

We are committed to re-confirming assignments by mid-July. At that time, we will email you regarding your assignment and also let you know about move-in and other specifics regarding the fall semester.

Important: If you no longer need on-campus housing because your plans have changed (i.e. you now intend to live off campus, commute to campus, or take all your classes remotely), we ask that you let us know as soon as possible. To cancel, go to Campus Express, click on Housing Assignments and simply hit the cancel button. At this time there will be no cancellation fees assessed. Please be aware that if you do cancel your housing, it will be unlikely that we will be able to reassign you to campus housing should your plans change.

Please look at our FAQs on the Penn COVID website for information that was not addressed here. We will continue to update the website and send out email communication for major announcements. We strongly encourage you to wait for instructions and updates before contacting us with questions. However, if you have a time sensitive issue, please connect with us via email at [living@upenn.edu](mailto:living@upenn.edu). In order to expedite a response, you should include your class status (first/second/third/fourth year or graduate student) in the subject line.

BUT if there were somehow a guarantee that ""if Amy gives up her salary, the workers will be spared"", then I'd definitely push for it to happen. So...unless I have that guarantee I would probably just see Amy giving up her salary as nothing more than a move to get some good press, which is hardly ethical, moral, etc.

Maaaaybe you could argue that Amy forgoing salaries helps establish some sense of normalcy that other CEOs should do the same, but eh, I don't really buy into it unless I see data.  


EDIT: I also don't think any layoffs are happening unless the fall semester gets shot. Yes, there was that dining hall fiasco, but that was arguably more at the fault of the company Penn contracts with to provide the dining hall workers.

Are you happy at Penn?,PronounceitGif,"Might be a little late to this - I think the best way I'd describe Penn is as follows:

If you are the perfect student/if you manage to maintain that 3.7+ and get the right job etc. Penn will be fantastic. I think Penn as a whole is very difficult to be happy at for most people - there is an ingrained culture of cutthroat/hyper competitive behavior which can push those select few of people to their highest highs and thus serves them very well. But that is also why you see the things you've mentioned such as Penn Face and burnout - you will be surrounded by a constant and unceasing stream of friends/contacts getting high power new jobs, amazing internships etc. that linking back to my first point - will be AMAZING if you are also one of those people and extremely frustrating and depressing if you are not. I'm speaking from a combination of anecdotal experience I had and what my friends said during their time there. I was fairly well rounded while I went to Penn (graduated '18) and was a part of one of the varsity sports teams and did research etc. There were great opportunities and I had fantastic experiences with many of the professors in the school - and I'd say as a baseline that if you are someone that only cares about the pursuit of knowledge etc you will have plenty of opportunities to push that. However, if you are someone that is more realistic/pragmatic and you care for your career prospects and future like I was, you'll spend a big amount of your time stressing and worrying and those things I mentioned earlier will only exacerbate that. 
Short way to put it - if you wind up in that top 10-20% of students you'll think Penn was awesome. If you're someone that wants a more holistic community with a focus on things outside of career development etc, or you don't want to be in a position where a single semester of poor performance could weigh on your mental for the rest of your college career, I'd strongly suggest looking at another fit. I can answer any specific questions you have in PM - just let me know if there's anything else I can help with!

Most people (myself included) spend hours on end working during the week, sacrificing opportunities to rest or go out with friends.

&#x200B;

A few of my friends are already very unhappy, and I truly think that is because they are letting the stress/competition/pre-professionalism of Penn influence them too much. ""Penn Face"" is real, and there is no denying that, but if you can find a supportive friend group, and make the most of resources like CAPS (albeit, it's not the best service) you should be able to at least minimize your unhappiness.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, the social and academic culture promoted on campus can lead to unhappiness, but everyone else is going through the same things as you.

I've been living in Philly for coming up on 6 years, and I frequently encounter the smothering feeling you are describing, especially during the dark and cold season. 2 years ago, I found a really really great place that helps with this a TON: [Morris Arboretum](http://www.morrisarboretum.org/). It's actually run by Penn, so you get in free with your PennCard, you just have to get out there. It's 14 miles from campus, about a 30 minute drive.

&#x200B;

Even in the cold season, it's beautiful to walk around. Best of all, they have the most well regarded fernery in the US. It's inside, hot and humid, and is some straight up [LotR lookin' shit.](http://sharonexner.com/general/Morris/Morris051112-14lg.jpg) I've gone there in winter and just chilled out and read a book. I'm originally from the mountains of North Carolina, and this place just kind of resets that city pressure confined feeling.

It's huge so you can escape city life, and the old gravestones that bear names like ""Mother"" or ""Artist"" etc accompanied simply by dates were somehow a comfort to me - an unburdening, a relief, and empowering. 

Socially, keep trying to find your people. There are so many kids at penn that you know there must be people with whom you click, it just takes finding them. I think basing it on a common interest is a good way to break through the 'socializing facades' common at penn. I came into my own at Penn when I began leaving campus to explore Philadelphia, on my own or with a friend or two. Creating shared experiences like that was a quick way to deepen existing friendships. Culturally the city is a stark contrast to what you feel on campus and it can be a reprieve to explore that. People out there just don't give a fuck.. I find encouragement in that. 

Lastly -- try to limit your social media use and try to experience only what's happening in the present, in real life. Not what might be in the future, or what you should be doing, etc. If you eat ice cream, enjoy it, don't think damn I shouldn't be eating ice cream.

Advice from the successful/unsuccessful dual degree transfers (request from Mod),mureytasroc,"(From my comment on one of those posts:)

CIS major in SEAS here.

I had a 4.0 GPA (more A+s than As) in my freshman year, took very challenging courses (spring semester was rajiv CIS 121, ESE 301, MATH 240, a grad level CIS class, a wharton class, and a half credit CIS class).  Had lots of AP credit so I could have completed the M&T coursework without ever overloading.  Was heavily involved in a few programming for social good and Wharton clubs.  Had other extracurriculars and put a lot of effort into my app.

I didn’t even get to the interview stage of the M&T transfer process (was recently rejected).  The fact is it’s so competitive that there’s really nothing you can do to secure a good chance of getting in (especially from CIS).  No matter what you do, it will be a Hail Mary.  That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t apply, just make sure you don’t obsess over it or expect to get in.  At the end of the day you can still take interesting/useful classes at Wharton as free electives no matter what.  And you are already at Penn so you don’t need to do any more clout chasing.

Enjoy your freshman year, make new friends, work hard in your classes, and do extracurriculars you enjoy.  If you want, you can apply to M&T because why not.  Just know that they accept a few people from each SEAS major (less from CIS) out of a large applicant pool.",29,,False,fv13010,False,False,1592326695.0,2020-06-16 11:58:15

"WSJ: Harvard to Have a Fall Semester, but Details Unclear",powereddeath,"Full text:

> Harvard University announced Monday that, given the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, it is leaving the door open for a fall semester without students on campus.
> 
> “We cannot be certain that it will be safe to resume all usual activities” by autumn, university provost Alan Garber wrote in a note to the school Monday. “Consequently, we will need to prepare for a scenario in which much or all learning will be conducted remotely.”
> 
> The coronavirus has killed 50,000 people nationwide, and Massachusetts, home to Harvard, has endured the third largest number of fatalities.
> 
> Colleges and universities across the country sent students home in March, moved classes online and canceled in-person summer programs. Now they are scrambling to figure out how to proceed when the new academic year begins.
> 
> Harvard has significant influence across higher education, and its announcement could impact how other colleges and universities proceed in the fall. Purdue University and Brown University are among schools planning to resume in-person classes in the fall, as long as conditions allow. Others like George Washington and Stanford said they would not make a decision until later this year.
> 
> Some universities said they are considering canceling the first semester and reopening in January of 2021. Dr. Garber said Harvard will conduct both classes and research this fall, even if some or all are remote. A range of scenarios, informed by epidemiological data and public health models, are under consideration.
> 
> “The primary message is that the University is moving forward with the fall semester, rather than delaying it,” school spokesman Jason Newton said in an email.
> 
> Harvard University consists of many colleges, and not all will follow the same schedule, Dr. Garber wrote. Even if students do come back, the campus is liable to look considerably different.
> 
> “If our community has not developed sufficient levels of immunity through recovery from the disease or vaccination, and if safe and effective antiviral therapy isn’t available, we will likely need adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, reliable and convenient viral testing, robust contact tracing procedures, and facilities for quarantine and isolation,” Dr. Garber said.
> 
> Schools around the nation rushed to move classes online this spring to the frustration of many students and professors. Dr. Garber said with greater time to prepare for the fall semester, the school will improve its performance and try to simulate extracurricular activities, even if students aren’t on campus.
> 
> The spokesman, Mr. Newton, declined to comment on whether tuition and fees would be adjusted, if classes were held remotely.",15,,False,fov52f0,True,False,1588095506.0,2020-04-28 12:38:26

Tunnel connecting College hall and Irvine,powereddeath,"Not sure if this is what you're thinking of:

There's an underground road that goes from the football field to Huntsman -- you can't access it as a student as its mainly used by facilities and security. 

Only reason I know about it was because I locked myself out of the computer lab in the basement of Addams Hall at 3am (all my stuff was locked inside). I called campus security and they took me through this [building](https://goo.gl/maps/4fvoUWAmNwC193BM7) behind ARCH. It looks like a small brick shed with nothing but a large metal door -- behind the metal door is an elevator that goes down to said tunnel. (For some reason he couldn't open the front door of Addams.)

Long story short, it's basically a large underground road that runs beneath the campus. I remember seeing a row of big garbage trucks parked down there as well as a bunch of cars used by campus security. 

Anyway, he took me to the underground entrance to Addams using this tunnel and he swiped me into the lab that was locked.

Only way I know about it is because that's how we went from our biol102 lab to the greenhouse for the assignment without exposing ourselves to the cold that day.

If you opt for one of those regional studies, I would take a relevant language. I'd take the language even if you're heavily considering it. The language courses usually have some cultural stuff in them too. But, beyond that, taking a language for fun can be a nice change of pace from Penn's career focus. I'm taking Italian because I enjoy Italian literature and cinema. Your language pick doesn't have to be important in the grand scheme of your college progression.

Gap year if you can really find something valuable.  Many people travel obviously that may not be possible this year although you might want to look around at programs in the USA and travel to a specific non covid State (not idea where you live).        

Can you line up a job/internship and do you care if u get paid. You didn't elaborate on your financial situation so I can't comment.      

Honestly, the vibe is so bad right now everywhere in the USA between everything going on.   Do you feel like you need to get away from living with your parents or are you good at home?  If so, honestly, I would stay home.  Is it possible to learn a new skill...honestly I was thinking maybe there were interesting hiking/biking  outdoors trips which are also learning experiences...I don't know.   Or, maybe you want to take classes locally  if you can.  I know my child, while at Penn, took a class at Hunter over in the summer (I live in NY).   Maybe pick something you want a survey of that you can get credit for.....or do online (the state schools are cheaper this was. city school which was even cheaper).     Again no clue what you are planning on majoring in.      I also think public speaking is a good skill to learn pre-penn depending on our major I know my child had many group presentations and it's hard to speak in front of people--it's a skill.

I really feel bad for everyone in College including my child who is at another school (not Penn) who is an studio art majors and has labs and art installations to do Senior year....no school past Thanksgiving, having to do pooled testing, quarantine kid.

BBB and premed coursework can definitely be completed in three years after transfering! BBB is a relatively flexible major in comparison to other science majors and premed classes just need to be spaced out well (which a college advisor can help with). Premed tends to be structured across 3 years so that students could complete the MCAT after their junior year. However, if you are starting one year later then you probably won’t be able to take the MCAT until senior year (which is fine since many students take a gap year between college and medical school). Also, if you upload the classes that you have already taken to XCAT you will know which of the requirements you have already completed and can plan your schedule accordingly. 

In terms of science classes, it's definitely an adjustment because most people in the class will be very smart and hardworking. However, each class definitely is different in terms of how challenging it is, and different classes grade on a curve while others do not. In my experience, however, the curve tends to help students instead of hurt them. The classes are of course challenging but very doable as long as you stay motivated and don’t overload yourself with courses.",1,,False,eo8jmpl,True,False,1558368074.0,2019-05-20 11:01:14

Source: both a student and full-time staff member, in charge of payroll for my dept. which includes students on grants.

&#x200B;

Given that you have consistently been submitting 20 hours per week, the official University position is that you MUST BE PAID that 20 hours and your supervisor can go fuck themselves.

&#x200B;

[This is the webpage with that guidance:](https://srfs.upenn.edu/student-employment/covid-19-supervisor-faq)

&#x200B;

**My work-study student or student worker cannot perform any tasks for my office remotely. What should I do?**

If the student cannot perform any of their  regular duties and there are no alternative duties the student can  complete remotely, the University’s guidance is that they should  continue to be paid for their regularly scheduled hours for the  remainder of the semester. This is aligned with the University’s  approach to full-time, part-time, and temporary staff and faculty during  this period of time.

**My department pays its matching share of work-study or student worker salaries through a federal government grant. How do I navigate this?** 

If your student is able to continue working on your  project remotely, you can continue to process their payment as usual in  Workday. If your student cannot work on your project remotely, you may  need to adjust your funding source (depending on future guidance from  funding agencies). **In either case, you and your student should continue  to submit and approve hours as usual in Workday for the remainder of the  semester. If the funding source needs to be adjusted later, payroll  reallocations can be made at such time.**

That last part is staff speak for PAY THEM NOW AND FIND THE FUNDING LATER, DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S A GRANT.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Your supervisor in trying to reduce your pay to save their grant funding (which is laughable as believe me, student worker pay is a negligible part of grant funding esp. federal - y'all are cheap) is SUPER FUCKING WRONG and they cannot do that to you.",4,,False,fm9vrwv,False,False,1585877682.0,2020-04-02 20:34:42

On campus employer only wants to pay me for the hours I'm able to work remotely,onekrustykrabtacopls,"Thanks for replying!

This is what I said to the director of Penn First Plus and the Student Employment Manager. They replied saying that my employer told them I was originally only supposed to work 10 hours and that she was worried that any student would find 20 hours to be too much—that's bullshit. I was signed up for 10 hours at the beginning *by mistake* and luckily I had enough evidence to prove this was a lie, but she definitely tried to use this to her advantage.

They haven't replied to my email where I included the evidence (previous emails where she admitted it was a mistake), but they're definitely making it really fucking hard for me to get anywhere with this, especially considering one of the people already included in the conversation is the manager of Student Employment.

Questions about Penn? Ask here!,WHiSPERRcs," 

Hey guys

I'm thinking about EDing to Penn but I'm not really sure if I want to go into the sciences or business. Right now I'm leaning towards applying to Wharton because I read that they have a requirement for X amount of business fundamental courses but they also require students to take 10 classes in the colleges of arts and sciences, meaning I have a built in opportunity to do both. With this logic, if I decide I like the sciences more I can internally transfer to the college,but my uncle who went to Penn told me that everyone transfers from the college to Wharton and no one does it the other way around. He explained that the college is slightly easier to get into so people abuse that slight advantage and then switch to Wharton as fast as they can. Is this actually true? Should I apply there over Wharton?

Questions about Penn? Ask here!,johnathanjones1998,"Pre professional tends to be a term applied to all of penn but more concentrated in certain schools/majors than others (mainly those that have opportunities to get high paying jobs immediately after graduation Eg anything wharton, cis, and consulting). It basically means that people are very career oriented and will be on top of getting things like internships and job offers. I really do suspect that it’s basically the same at most other universities of similar caliber, but because we have a business school (that is very well known) it might be easier to ascribe that moniker to us. I personally have been able to find non-pre professional oriented friends in the college without any issues (and similarly could find pre professional groups if I wanted to).

Questions about Penn? Ask here!,singularreality,"this is sort of funny ... know Brown kids ... they don't take a lot of P/f cause they know it won't be viewed so well to employers and grad schools... Penn generally has a more interdisciplinary mindset in general than many other schools .... and that is the focus of Ben F. scholars (who come from all four schools, not just CAS). The competitive atmosphere is prevalent at Penn for sure (and job seeking is a good thing by the way -- this is not just a recreational think tank endeavor) but it is also your mindset.  I had a roommate at Penn that never talked about grades and read a newspaper before every exam and just would not get sucked into it... and I know others that calculate their gpa after every homework assignment and try (usually unsuccessfully) to game the system. But there are plenty of people who seek collaboration and just want to learn and know if they study hard they will do just fine -- these are the chillest and the coolest and maybe it is you?  I think also that in some disciplines like comp. sci., your grades while important are not as important as what can you do, what have you coded, where are your capabilities.  For pre-med and pre-law you have a bit more pressure (not only at Penn but at ALL schools) to do well not only in your GPA but on the MCAT or LSAT so you have that pressure.

For the business/finance/consulting clubs, they may ask you to do a preliminary stock pitch or make a consulting slide deck on a problem they give you. They don’t expect them to be great, but they expect to see that you’ve put in the work.

Terminology for social events at Penn,renoceros,"Lmao I got you.

Frat Parties - just a party at a frat. Lots of drinking, dancing, people hooking up. Dress how you want (note: it'll likely be hot). Many frat parties are ""open"" meaning anyone can go, some are ""closed"" and invite only. Some frats are tough about letting people in, others are not. Go with your friends and have fun.

Downtowns - a group (often frat) hosts a party off-campus at a club or someplace ""downtown"". Often expensive and you usually need to get a ticket or rsvp or something in advance. Can be a good time, especially if you know a bunch of people going.

Mixers - party/get together between two groups, often a fraternity and sorority. Smaller than a frat party, almost always just open to people in those groups. Have a theme a lot of the time (sports, 90's, etc.) and people dress to match it.

Date Night - pretty self-explanatory. Grab a date and have fun. What you do on the date night depends, sometimes it's basically a small party, sometimes it's a nice dinner, sometimes you go somewhere (Dave & Buster's, etc.). Would default to dressing nicer here (semi-formal is probably good) but if you're going to one of these you were probably invited, so just ask.

Formal - a more formal version of a date night. Most groups have one per semester/year and people dress up more. Super fun.

BYO - dinner at a BYO/BYOB restaurant. ""BYO"" stands for ""bring your own,"" referring to alcohol. You go out to dinner with a group, bring a bunch of wine and have a good time. Because of the BYO policy, they don't check ID, so these are popular. A lot of these are in Chinatown or downtown somewhere, others are closer like Chili Szechuan or Thai Singha. They're also really nice because you get a chance to talk more. And boat races!

People drink at all these events, but you don't have to. If you're more interested in big parties or large events, frat parties and downtowns are likely more for you. If you'd prefer something smaller, BYOs, date nights etc. are probably more your vibe. All of them can be fun, especially with people you like.

Any Advice on Loans?,nk2199,"I noticed that you mentioned you were hoping to do a PhD after and wanted to provide some clarity on what that is like money-wise. Basically, if you get into a competitive program for STEM, you'll probs get a yearly stipend that ranges from $30-45k - the range has nothing to do with the school but rather cost of living. So for super expensive places like SF or NY, schools offer these higher stipends. I personally have not heard of anyone in any field at any school getting an offer of more than $45k. When you take into account rent and groceries and other necessities, you'll basically be down to $1k left over each month, which at least half should go into savings and you probably have other random costs like travel, buying a bike, paying a security deposit on an apt or so many other things. Basically, a PhD will not pay you well and you will not be able to work any job during it that makes a lot of money, aside from potentially interning a summer or two. The one caveat is if you go to grad school you can defer your student loans until then. But then basically you'd have $280k in loans waiting for you after grad school. And the PhD job market isn't necessarily great in that it lands you such a high paying job it doesn't matter.

I wanted to re-emphasize what someone else posted breaking down the loan into monthly payments. At $280 K, and with private loans, you could be paying more than $3k a month for ten years. That is basically the type of commitment you'll be making. And it's not just this debt and huge amount of money you'll be stuck paying for ten years - it's the fact that you won't be able to contribute money to your savings instead and build a safety net or when you're older, be able to advance other personal areas of your life like owning a home or starting a family.

I wanted to suggest a hybrid solution. You could go to your state school first and then transfer to Penn? It could potentially save you a lot of money and you could still get the Penn degree. It would also give you the time to show that you're independent (and potentially be emancipated, or get married) so that you could get more favorable financial options from Penn.

As I've mentioned before (not sure if this sub or elsewhere on Reddit), your family can earn like $250,000 per year and have other financial assets (like equity in a $750,000 home, 401K, etc.) and students can *still* qualify for at least 1/3 of aid from Penn.  I played around with the aid calculator myself and found the above.  And even despite how generous Penn's aid program is, 55% of undergrads don't qualify for *any* aid, which coming from Rutgers University for undergrad is insane to me.

So if you don't qualify for any aid, but you still have your question, that leads me to believe your family is wealthy as fuck but unfortunately isn't giving you a penny toward college.

uncertainty,Wise-Aardvark,"Hello!

First of all, congratz on getting in!!! I’m a senior majoring in polisci, and can attest that a 4.0 is attainable with the major as long as you study well, go to office hours, and put in the work. (And don’t take PSCI 150 your first semester).

As for the clubs, some of them are hard to get into, but do you really want to join something that is so elitist that it only accepts a small fraction of its applicants? Maybe not. The process has gotten a lot better since I was a freshman, and even though it’s rough, I promise you that you’ll find your place. 

Lastly, I’ve always been able to get into the classes I wanted to get into. Most of the time, it’s just a matter of using penncoursealert (tells you when a class opens up), or emailing the professor. The largest lecture I’ve been in was 200, but in between recitations, the people sitting near you, and freshmen friends, you’ll have plenty of support. 

Lastly, and I might be reading this wrong, but it seems like you’re hesitating between Penn and a much smaller school. Think not only about academics, but the people you’ll be meeting and how that school will set you up for success afterwards. Also think about where the schools are. Philadelphia is really really cool, but you might vibe more with wherever there other school is. In terms of resources, Penn has given me so many opportunities (including the opportunity to be a legal intern) and also helped me become a more autonomous person.

Penn has lots and lots of clubs and some are competitive and some are not and many people join several and then  drop one and find the one or two that are right for them.  You will find clubs and organizations you are interested in and some will be a match.  Tons of people get ""rejected"" by one or more and accepted into others... do not worry about it.. this is a Penn strength..... tons of fun... when you can put the books down.

While it is hard to get all of the classes you want and the times and semesters you want to take them, most students get most of the classes they want to take.  It may be more difficult with Covid because some course lectures with large class sizes may only be pre-reorded due to the size.  My favorite class at Penn was in a huge lecture hall, Russian History...  I just loved the lectures... but large classes have recitations and group things going on and study sessions You can take smaller classes too -- freshman seminars, some language classes...

Tips for incoming Freshmen,soonami,"Memorization makes everything easier. E.g. if you see a mutation like G12C, knowing what each amino acid is, whether it's polar, uncharged, acidic, has an amino group, etc helps give you the shortcut to understanding something versus looking up the mutations and trying to understand the differences. This is the same with DNA nucleotides,  acronyms and abbreviations, common processes, or techniques.

If I said, ""I used CRISPR to introduce a V600E mutation in BRAF in a BALB/C mouse to generate a mouse model of CRC..."" the more  acronyms or principles you understand from the start, the fast you can you can get to the actual question or problem.

&#x200B;

As for pre-med recommendations, the 100-level intro CHEM, BIO, PHYS classes are weed-out courses. They are graded on a curve, but expect only 25-30% of students to get A's. This is in a class where a third or half of the students are valedictorians or salutatorians--i.e. high achievers. If you don't get at least a B+ or A- in these classes, your pre-med core GPA will suffer and anything below an A- (\~3.7) average will make it hard to be accepted to a US MD school.

Little Tips For Baby Quakers,Realistic-Storm,"1. Definitely figure out where all your classes are *before* classes actually start. 
2. For the love of all things good, please balance your studies and social life. Don't let one take over, or else you'll end up in a really bad position academically and mentally. 
3. Don't let the competitive/work hard play hard mindset get to you as much. Do your best and do try to work to what suits you, but please don't compare yourself to others at Penn from different backgrounds and such and do take breaks from the campus in general and go into Center City!
4. Get used to being alone. College is great overall, you'll meet so many people. But, usually, when it comes to your day to day, you're mostly alone for most of your time to classes, work, even eating at the dhall sometimes. Not everyone will have the same schedule so it's important to get used to being by yourself. 
5. Find where you can be productive and actually get work done. The libraries, coffee shops, and sometimes even just random spots around campus can be nice and you'll soon figure out what you like best. 
6. Get the dining plan with the most dollars. 
7. Do make use of NSO and syllabus week to have fun and go to parties and social events! Great time to make friends and find other people to hang out with, classes are also great for this. 
8. Midterm season can be rough, plan accordingly. Weather can also be rough, once again plan accordingly. 
9. Try to avoid eating lunch at the dhalls/brunch. For some reason, I always felt like that was the worst time to get food just because the place was always packed, weekend brunch at commons was always a favorite of mine though. I avoided Hill basically most of freshman year. Lauder has a really good dinner most days of the week and one special entre every day, you can check the menu online, but I'd flip flop between commons and lauder every night for dinner and usually go to McClelland in the quad for a bagel and bananas in the morning. 
10.  Do get the writing and foreign language requirement out of the way as early as possible! It can be a pain, especially for writing seminars, to find classes that upperclassmen can join.

Little Tips For Baby Quakers,,"1.  Be professional in your communications with professors and TAs.  Err on the side of formality for at least the first email.  Do not use emojis.  ""Dear Dr. X"" or ""Good morning, Dr. X"" or ""Good evening, Mr/Ms TA"".  Never start an email to a female professor as ""Mrs."".

2.  Be polite to your professors and TAs.  Maybe you'll get a bad grade you don't agree with.  Maybe an assignment was confusing.  Maybe you don't like them that much.  Do not give them a reason to remember you by name for bad reasons.  They do not exist to serve you.  If you don't get an A in their class, they didn't ""fail"" you.  Be polite. 

3.  Respect the time of your professors and TAs.  If they don't respond to your email within three hours, do not start sending passive-aggressive emails about ""Just checking to make sure you got this"".  If the syllabus does not state otherwise, wait 2-3 days to follow up.  Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on theirs.

4.  Please use office hours.  It is not a sign of weakness.  It is a sign of a student taking their studies seriously.  If you use office hours and ever think you might need a recommendation, do an end of semester follow-up email.

If you can follow these simple guidelines, you'll be above 80% of your classmates.",18,,False,fq0ti08,False,False,1589037432.0,2020-05-09 10:17:12

Don’t go to Pret within a 10 minute window of 10:30, 12:00, or 3:00pm. Those are when Wharton classes let out and it gets extremely crowded with a very disorganized line. Also avoid Houston Hall during lunch if your classes are only an hour apart.

If you’re planning to party, bring shoes and a jacket that you don’t care about. (Mostly applies to girls, but guys probably don’t want to be showing up to their 9am with gross shoes)

Bring a sportcoat/shoes/tie or dress/heels when you move in. If you choose to get involved with Greek life, you’re going to need them earlier on (also if you have an interview, etc). A friend of mine planned to bring his to Penn after fall break, but ended up panic buying at Macy’s in September because he needed a date night outfit...

Get the plan with most dining dollars! Unless you live in Hill and maybe KCECH/Lauder (and even then you will prob prefer the most dining dollars).

Lightning round of Penn terms you’ll probably learn anyway: 
Stommons = Starbucks in the basement of Commons. 
JMHH (only used in writing) = Huntsman Hall (main Wharton building). 
BYO = going out to a restaurant and getting hammered if you choose (whatever club you’re with will provide the drinks and you’ll Venmo; often no fake ID necessary).

CIS 240 - How do I utterly not fail at this monstrosity of a class?,johnathanjones1998,"Not a TA but did well in the class. Here are random thoughts. Happy to answer in more depth if you PM me. 

I took it with farmer in the spring. I think he’s harder than Taylor but not sure. 

In general, I think the class is about strategizing how to spend your time to maximize points. 

It is really obvious that one of the difficulty factors with cis 240 is the fact that its workload shoots up exponentially with respect to time. Unfortunately, the time consuming assignments also occurred with challenging assignments from other classes, so it is about doing well early on so you get cut some slack for not having enough time to debug later on. 

I took it with farmer, but here’s how I remember homework’s going. 

Hw1-4 were fairly straightforward and a fair amount of the questions were based on patt and Patel so there are things you could ref online if you need extra  explanation of concepts outside the text. Hw3, sequential logic, was tough for me to conceptually understand (and I think it is tough for everyone, things like RS latches, timing diagrams etc). I later discovered a YouTube channel called Ben Eater who has an entire series making a breadboard computer. Though he doesn’t follow 240 in any way, it’s just nice to see the circuits and gates in action with some explanation. 

All the homeworks here on out are either one shot and “bam it works” or some version of “Cri I have to spend all night debugging”: 

Hw5 was lc4 assembly introduction. This one was easy. 
Hw6 is more lc4 assembly. Slightly more difficult 
Hw7 is traps (you’ll learn about these) but it took a loooot of debugging to get right. 

Now from here on out is where the extra credit on the homeworks really help you out:
Hw8 had 20 pts of extra credit opportunity. I knew the rest of my sem would be death, so I spent as much time as possible on this assignment to ensure the max points. It really helped make up for the compiler assignments which I couldn’t do well on bc of persistent debugging issues. 

Hws9 also had opps for EC. Take advantage of those

The last three weeks were the “exponential time” assignments:
Hw10 and 11 are the pennsim and compiler homeworks...some of my friends got it in one go. Others couldn’t get it done. I was in the latter group. 

(Also, it is a “compiler” for a penn made language. It isn’t complicated conceptually, it’s just a program that takes in a file with characters in it and pattern matches against a list of allowed expressions. Once you hit an allowed expression, you spit out the lc4 cpu instruction into a binary file. Actual compilers are waaaay more complicated)

The point of laying out these assignments is to emphasize how putting in a lot of effort towards the beginning of the course will give you more leeway when you hit the end of the course. I know a lot of people didn’t do so well bc they relied on the last few homeworks to pull up their grades, which wasn’t a great strategy. 

Look into tutoring as well. It’s more helpful for the midterms and final which are a significant portion of your grade. Farmer didn’t release solutions for his practice midterms, but I imagine having a tutor in 240 would work with you on those problems. 

Also definitely hit up the TAs. Office hours are dead the day an assignment is released, but are packed starting a couple days before the assignment is due. They are also incredibly fast on piazza and will help you debug (there was a guy who had something like 1000+ questions/comments asked and the TAs amazingly responded to him for everything).

edit: Patt and Patel make an LC3 programming language in their book. I took a look at the IsA and it is remarkably similar to LC4 used in 240. You can definitely practice with LC3, but you need to look for a simulator online.",7,,1563045555.0,etnlk72,False,False,1562991116.0,2019-07-12 23:11:56

CIS 240 - How do I utterly not fail at this monstrosity of a class?,seyerly16,"I have been a TA and will be a TA this coming semester for CIS 240. So here’s a couple things.

The Gates and Logic are probably the easiest part of the class. Few students struggle with this and it’s fairly straightforward. 

The LC4 assembly isn’t that bad. It looks scary at first but I find most students are able to wrap their heads around the concept. The struggle tends to be in the details, a flipped bit can wreck everything. However this is solved with time and hard work. 

The C programming isn’t that bad. It has typical for loops, ints, functions, etc.  What gets people with C programming is the pointers and memory allocation and management. Make sure you thoroughly understand how pointers work, a lot of students program C like they would Java without knowing how pointers work and that’s where most of the pain comes from. 

Finally the compiler. Yes it sounds super scary and I won’t lie it’s pretty hard but if you start early it’s very manageable. In terms of compilers it’s pretty simple, and that project is more or less glorified pattern matching.

My best advice is to use the TAs early on as they truly can explain the concepts in an understandable way.",7,,False,etnhwa6,False,False,1562987764.0,2019-07-12 22:16:04

Real talk about being an introvert,goreea,"I'm pretty much an interovert, not rich and not a party person either and honestly, if you find a solid friend group, you won't be missing out on much. I'm enjoying my time at Penn and love my friends that I've met here. I don't think you should worry about your experience being hindered. 

On the other hand, the pre-professional culture is pretty intense. Sometimes humanities jokes are thrown around, but I don't necessarily think anyone is really being looked down upon. Again, finding your friend group will help with that. In terms of groups, I really suggest a performing arts group (even if you don't have any experience, you should try something out!) or a cultural group, because there, you have ppl from all different backgrounds and no one really cares what major you are. 

Basically, the problems you brought up do exist, but finding a community that understands you and shares the same experiences as you helps minimize those problems. 

And there's a lot of diversity in interest groups and communities so I'm sure you'll find where you belong here :)",12,,False,ekcxhfl,False,False,1554688286.0,2019-04-07 20:51:26
Real talk about being an introvert,seyerly16,"1) No your experience will not be hindered. It's a big school so there are all kinds of people. Best thing to do is during the first week or so visit the Student Activities Fair. All the clubs are outside at tables and you can check them out and decide for yourself which groups you would like to join. Also even if a student comes from a wealthy family that doesn't necessarily mean that daddy has given him/her a blank check. I don't ever see flashy wealth and everything there is to do in Philly for the most part is affordable. There are a few (like 2-3 tops) fraternities which charge ridiculous membership fees but beyond that everything is pretty accessible. 

&#x200B;

2) I wouldn't say that humanities is looked down or that the pre-professional culture is overwhelming. Everyone for the most part is kind and mature and willing to help and collaborate. Pre-professional culture only really permeates into majors that are ""prestigious"" job oriented (so Wharton, computer science, premed, etc.)  You just aren't going to find that sort of culture in the philosophy department (maybe a little in the Econ department but even then not too much).

I’m dating someone who isn’t at Penn so I don’t have firsthand experience with actually dating at Penn. However - (as mentioned in the article) the semesterly parties hosted by Asian sororities have a certain white Jewish male presence, and from what my friends have told me, there’s way more weird stuff when using a dating app than when dating with another approach, since people think they can say whatever.

Asian fetish at Penn??,Necto74,"The article made me curious, so I wanted to look deeper into the data to see how widespread the issue is. Note that the data won't tell you how often you will face fetishization if you date around at Penn.

  
The article mentions that in the frats community ""at least a third of the dates were always Asian women"". So what percentage of people identifying as women are also Asians at Penn ? Is it far from 1/3 ?

Sadly, I couldn't find Gender x Race demographics. But looking only at race, among the 10,233 undergrads:

* 2,282 are Asian Americans, 22.3% of total
* About 559 are international Asians (41% of the 1,364 international students), 5.4% of total
* That brings us to  27.7% of students being Asian

Now, I don't know if the figure is the same if we only consider only people identifying as women. If anyone knows where to find that, let me know.  


Also, even if the Race demographics of ""whom white guys date"" was exactly representative of the overall Penn demographics, it doesn't mean that there wouldn't be fetishization issues. So for that you would probably have to ask Asian women here how bad it is for them.

Now this area is very far from the university but you can take the train to 30th street station for $5 and it takes 20 minutes.

Learning about Investment,Housesize3,"There are several reasons why you might've asked this question, and answering your question well depends on what that reason is.

Do any of these sound like what you have in mind?

* you are interested by investment and finance on an academic level and want to learn a lot about the theory of how financial systems operate.

* you're interested in learning how to invest the money you have/ expect to have, because it is a much faster way to build wealth than interest in a bank account or burying it in your backyard.

* you want to know enough to not feel stupid when people start talking about buying a certain company's stock at a party (maybe you go to weird parties i dunno)

Learning about Investment,Housesize3,"It'd kinda be a waste of a valuable course slot on something like personal finance, which you can get the important part of from a book or two. Besides, I'm sure there are lots of complicated rules about staying neutral on a lot of things that professors, at least in theory, have to follow. Also a class of ""how to pay taxes"" just sounds like an absolute snooze-fest. It was much more helpful for me to hear ""there's a form called the 1040 which has all the instructions you need; read them, follow them, due date April 15. Now let's do more interesting things.""

I mentioned the book _I will teach you to be rich_ in this thread. Check it out from the library or buy it (it's only $10 and it's good). It's better than most pf books because it is a one-stop shop and doesn't overload you with info.

If, instead, you read an investment textbook, you still won't be able to figure out personal finance because the book probably won't tell you about debt and credit, but if you read IWTYTBR you will learn the basics about everything that actually matters, and the basics are pretty much enough until you are a multimillionaire. You're free to look for an online course, but you don't need one.",1,,False,fbemch5,False,False,1576788896.0,2019-12-19 14:54:56
Learning about Investment,Housesize3,"rule #1 of investing: take risk but avoid ruin.

rule #2 of investing: if someone tells you to invest in a particular stock or a particular financial instrument, it's probably worthless advice. If they're so confident in what they're saying, they wouldn't be telling you, they'd be pouring their own money into it and making piles and piles of fat stacks of cash.

--------------

Academics: you want the key economic concepts. You're free to take econ classes but they're not necessary to get the really fundamental stuff.

You want to have a strong grasp of these things: opportunity cost, inflation, interest, concept of equilibrium, capital vs. labor, market structures (e.g. perfect competition vs oligopoly vs monopoly), market failure, public goods & externalities,  supply and demand for different market structures, elasticity, basics of game theory (prisoner's dilemma, nash equilibrium, dominant strategy).

Then, some investing-specific stuff: what is a financial instrument, difference between asset and liability. common types of financial instruments: stocks, bonds. understand that bonds are essentially debt. Maybe take ECON 246: Money, Credit, Banking for a very academic view of things. 

--------------------

from a personal finance perspective: read Ramit Sethi's _I will teach you to be rich_. Buy the actual book, don't pirate it. I know it sounds like a scam based on the title but the advice is good. Nothing new to an experienced investor but if you're completely new to investing like I was when I first read the book, you'll find it helpful.

You'll learn what a 401k is, the difference between a Roth and a Traditional IRA, why anyone should care what these things are. Also how to invest when you have a lot of time and therefore have a lot of time to let the market's short-term ups and downs even themselves out.

Too much to go into here, but buy the book. Or if you can't, get it from a library.",3,,False,fbag9rd,False,False,1576677330.0,2019-12-18 07:55:30

Social Consequences of Skipping Parties?,unexpected_firetruck,"Yep, if you don't go to parties, everyone will know. You see, there's the infamous Penn blacklist, and if you haven't shown up to a party within your first three weeks, you WILL be put on the blacklist. Once you're on there, you're done for socially. Want someone to edit your writing sem essay for you? Tough luck. Want someone's shoulder to cry on at 4 am while working on your CIS 160 assignment? No sir. 

In all seriousness (and this advice has been repeated multiple times already), it is absolutely **not necessary** to go to parties if you don't want to. Some of my closest friends never went to a **single** frat party their entire freshman year. You will find **plenty** of like-minded people who would rather do other things on a Friday night.

That being said, don't write parties off either. If you aren't stepping outside of your comfort zone in college, you're not doing college right. Try them out once or twice (esp during NSO).

Go to one just to see what it's like, maybe, but you won't be missing out on much if one is all you go to. 

The other common drinking social events are BYOs hosted by clubs you join, which are basically group dinners with upperclassmen buying alcohol for everyone to share. In my opinion, it's a much better way to get to know people and be social. (Though maybe more costly since you're paying for your meal + drinks.)

* MKSE 312: Theory of Networks (the study of networks, such as social networks, financial networks, etc.)

MacBooks and MacOS are a whole other ecosystem.

You're also right about resell value. For some unknown reason people just love Apple and MacBooks even if they're worse at performance.

If that's what matters, though it may only come down to a hundred or so dollars difference, then the MacBook might be a better choice.

CAPS won't meet with incoming freshmen until the semester starts,Housesize3,"Adding on to this, they are effective for a very specific type of problem and, from what I've heard, ineffective elsewhere.

Problems that CAPS can probably help you with are:

* Not super urgent (you have to schedule meetings well in advance, on the order of multiple days if not weeks in advance)

* Not long-term (you will be referred elsewhere if it doesn't resolve after a few months)

* Actually solvable (if outside circumstances are genuinely bad as opposed to just some worries about stuff that actually turns out ok, then no therapist is gonna be helpful. Negative feelings in response to bad circumstances are sometimes a useful signal anyways)

* Probably the result of you encountering some sort of unfamiliar problem rather than working out a long-standing one (if you've been unsuccessfully trying to solve a long-standing problem using many different smart approaches for the past five years, a CAPS session that meets once a week for an hour over two months probably won't magically get you the answer. That's not a problem with CAPS necessarily, that's just the nature of hard problems sometimes)

What to do during freshman summer?,PaisleyCactus,"Honestly, I just worked part time at a gas station summer of freshman year. I understand it’s a little different due to the pandemic but anything you are able to do to get experience on your resume is good if you’ve never been employed before. I live in a rural area and it was either work there or be a farm hand for the summer. 

Since I was working part time, I used some of my extra time to develop my skills and hobbies. This allowed me to self-study Spanish as I hadn’t completed my language requirement at that point in time as well as develop some basic computer skills which I was (and still am) embarrassing lacking in. I also used excess free time to work on my garden and practice my welding skills as a hobby. 

Community college classes are worth looking into if you want some intellectual stimulation. They likely will not transfer to Penn but it keeps the mind sharp. Who knows, maybe you can earn a stand alone certificate from a community college for a fraction of the cost of attending a Penn summer course. That route requires more investigation but if you aren’t willing/able to pay Coursera/ EdX courses are at least something to do. 

Overall, if you are able to secure some sort of internship go for it. If not, no worries thousand of kids didn’t get an internship freshman summer and that is especially true this year. Try to stay busy. Maybe earn some spending money if you can and try to independently learn whatever you can.

Going to therapy does take courage, and its not easy to put yourself out there for help, but I can say personally that it can be very rewarding. It's rarely a cure on its own, but it's a valuable first step on the road of finding a healthy way to live with mental illness.

That being said, if CAPS is too intimidating there are lots of other resources you can go to. There are peer services like the Reach-A-Peer helpline and Penn Benjamins.

CAPS was useless - I was self-mutilating and self-medicating, but all they did was throw me into a group therapy session with kids whose significant others had cheated on them.

The psycho-pharmacologist to whom CAPS referred me was flat out harmful.  He over medicated me - while I was no longer suicidal and depressed, I wasn't ""there"".  I stopped caring about everything entirely.  I cut class, fucked up on-campus-recruiting (this was early senior year when I started seeing him), I gain 50 lbs and started sleeping 16+ hours a day.  Looking back, he prescribed for me stuff you give to institutionalized schizophrenics, and there was never a plan to ween me off.  This over-medicating went on for 3 years, and contributed to me losing jobs and friends.  I'm really surprised I didn't just pass out in my bathtub and die.

What finally worked for me was (i) Seeing a psychiatrist who was certified in psychotherapy; he treated me with both meds and therapy - he worked to understand my life story and my issues.  Eventually, I was able to go off meds. (ii) Taking ownership of my recovery by eating / exercising / sleeping correctly.  

There is definitely a light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't know your story, and I'm not a certified professional.  However, I feel comfortable emphasizing a comprehensive, holistic approach.  Meds can be a first step, but they are not the last step, and they need to be closely monitored.

What are some thing you wish you knew prior to attending?",throwmeoutand,"Put effort into meeting people again / arranging things to do with people you meet that you like. Actually follow-up, even though you might be worried that people will turn you down. Don't expect the other person to start things off. Don't feel bad if they don't. They probably have similar worries spinning through their heads.

Thinks might be a little awkward at times but that's life. Awkwardness doesn't have as serious repercussions later on as you might think.

Beginning of freshman year is literally the only time when literally everyone else is looking to make new friends, much like you are. Later on people get more averse to awkwardness / stressed out about school and the future so will ignore you a lot more, be unwilling to go through the initial awkwardness of getting to know you well, be less likely to strike up spontaneous convos, and be less likely to plan hangouts at all.

Put yourself out there, don't worry to much about scheduling hangouts at the expense of schoolwork, etc.

Find a group/club that you like that actually does things. I know people will say you shouldn't stress out about this but that doesn't mean you shouldn't put in any effort or minimal effort. Put in the effort until you find something, no matter how long that takes. There is something you will like here, I guarantee. Try and picture what you would like doing and see if something exists for it. Don't give up if you don't find what you like at the fall activities fair. There are plenty of other ways to find out about student groups. It's easy to miss good opportunities in the crowds there, or maybe your ideal opportunity just wasn't at the fair.

Why I supported Donald Trump,acesilver1,"""Because I'm white, male, straight, and angry.""

Trump represents a step back for everyone, and those who voted for him are not going to be in any better position. By voting for him, you dismiss the real fears from people of color and minority communities. If you do not believe their fears, please look up all the recent racial and bigoted attacks that have been perpetrated by straight, white men like yourself. Of course, Trump supporters have also experienced their share of attacks, but they are not close to the number as those perpetrated by Trump supporters.

I'm not sorry the system is trying to correct itself for hundreds of years of oppressing other classes by disenfranchising them, not offering opportunities, creating systems that present severe structural problems to communities of color that cannot be simply corrected by ""working harder."" I'm not sorry that you, a straight white man, are caught in that crossfire in this day and age. Had you been born 40-60 years ago, you would have had it better. 

But please, do continue to vote your conscience. Do not listen to the PC non-sense excuse. Being put in your place for your misinformed ideas is not infringing on your rights to say them. Find a community that will help spread them, such as rural white communities, or Republican strongholds, communities where there is probably not even one token person of color. Then you will no longer experience ""PC"" because no one will disagree with you.

Trump won the election with racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, bigoted rhetoric. It gave validation to ideas that people of color and white allies have been working to dismantle since slavery. Now they are back and out in the open. Your vote for him means nothing that he said about these communities bothers you. 

Hence, you have nothing to fear because, like you said, you are white, male and straight. Your anger that you are not able to achieve what you want despite having the trifecta of privilege is now directed towards dismantling whatever progress marginalized communities made. Maybe in your case, it really is that you ""didn't work hard enough."" People of color, women and other marginalized communities aren't taking away opportunities from white men. They are simply leveling the playing field after hundreds of years of unequal treatment.

I'll end it with a quote: ""Equality can feel like oppression. But it’s not. What you’re feeling is just the discomfort of losing a little bit of your privilege.""

He isn't saying the rising equality of minorities is bad because it infringes on his opportunities. He's saying that the system put in place to empower minorities is flawed and undervalues many people of ""privileged"" races, such as many East Asian ethnicities  and Caucasians. This is not an argument on whether we want to help certain minorities break the cycle of poverty that they've experienced due to past oppression. We both agree breaking this cycle would benefit both us and them. What we don't agree on are the solutions to helping with this issue.

We need to be assisting secondary education in impoverished regions and providing good jobs to the bread-winners of lower-class families, which study after study shows improves the lives of their children and incentives them to get a better education. Giving underprivileged minorities an easier path to a good college such as UPenn is not only giving them a fake reality of how the world will treat them, but is also blatantly sending a message that ""because you're black you need more help in life.""

There's also a lot of social value in giving low income students a shot at higher education, which is why the federal government incentivizes universities to admit more via Pell grants.

Is the Philomathean Society selective? The app process seems pretty rigorous,pyre_teh_god,"Philo has a pretty poor reputation on campus. They're extremely left-wing, especially socially (think SJW or stereotypical woke-ness). For example, they donated their entire club budget (all the remaining yearly membership dues) to BLM last year. Which is fine, an admirable cause, but it also demonstrates the organization's mindset and priorities. They're also known for being very arrogant about their club, which they believe is a rubberstamp of intelligence and scholarship. Most of the people in Philo are a little weird. It's hard to explain, but I don't necessarily think it's the good kind of weird.

If you apply, your application should avoid any mention of religion or anything construable as a possible right-wing leaning. Especially if you're a straight white guy. It's a nonstarter otherwise.

I obviously have a negative opinion of Philo, and I'm not going to try to conceal my bias. That being said, from a more neutral standpoint, Philo is more of a social club than an intellectual society. It's like a frat for weirder people; you pay dues, you hang out at the Philo annex, your friends are the other Philo people. It's a community, but it's not the most academically rigorous community.

There are a number of great societies and reading groups that are exclusively for graduates though, where the students are sharper and more serious, but I don't think we're allowed to enter these as undergrads.

I've wanted to start a classical literary society with an emphasis on producing papers or analysis. I think it's much-needed here on campus.

Is the Philomathean Society selective? The app process seems pretty rigorous,johnathanjones1998,"Hi I do want to respond as someone who is a conservative and a recently graduated member. You shouldn't find yourself trying to self-censor in philo (and I certainly didn't). That being said, if you do bring controversial topics up in conversation, you should expect to be ready to defend your stance (this holds true for both left and right-leaning individuals in philo). I will say that  philo was the only place I felt comfortable discussing those things on campus without being immediately turned away/dismissed (its also a reason why we are often not considered ""woke"" enough lol).

I do like to think that we are academically rigorous. We have weekly teas with  professors doing exciting research at Penn, produce our own literary journal, do archival work, host art galleries w/local Phila artists + grad students, and run an annual lecture featuring prominent academics (recently, the poet laureate of the united states). At its core, we are no longer a literary society in the strictest sense; rather, philo focuses on trying to provide opportunities for students to interact with and contribute to the academic standing at Penn in a way that the members deem appropriate.

Of course, if you do just want the social component, that exists as well (but if you're solely joining for the social aspect, you're better off with an actual frat since we aren't one by any stretch of the imagination). If you are looking for a book/journal club, I agree that you should probably be looking at some graduate/major specific circles (though if there is enough interest you can start one in philo).

Overall, the only person who can make the decision is you. My + the other commenters' perspectives are both biased interpretations of our experiences with the society.

\--

Replying separately to your BLM point because that is the only thing I overtly disagree with. The organizations we donated to (bronx defenders, legal rights center, phila bail fund, national black justice coalition, national bail fund network) help secure legal counsel, post bail for protestors, and fund legal battles for individuals whose rights were violated. Note, all of those organizations fight for free speech/expression. None of them are BLM. We donated because it was the human thing to do for people who needed it and not because of political leanings.

People gave you that money specifically for the club and its projects.

Discussion on writing sem,Housesize3,"no complete theories here either but speaking as a senior who got back into reading and writing recently and is loving it (despite hating writing sem when i took it):

* endless revision in a genre that doesn't have super-obvious payoff. I bet if you count up how many words we write (text messages, social media dms, emails included) people write a _ton_, but it's way more fun to revise something you have a really deep understanding of than do a mock-research paper on a subject that twelve other ppl are doing.

* required for everyone means that you kinda have to have a one-size-fits-all which isn't great

* could be partially a self-fulfilling prophecy; believe writing sem is bad, treat it unseriously, voila! it's bad

* most ppl who take the class are freshmen, who were trained in high school to write in a weird imitation of literary critics from past centuries. They didn't go deep into the details of other formats like blogposts or tweetstorms or even a chapter in a realistic fiction novel!

* many ppl struggle to find the time to read. i have never met someone i consider a good writer who doesn't read/ watch movies/ take in other forms of really good content. By good content I mean anything that you'd be willing to pay money to read. (Free things can still be good content; just that you'd be willing to pay for it if it costs money)

* Speaking of good writing, it feels uncool to talk about your writing positively! Especially if it's about a personal topic. Because talking about your writing positively is what narcissists do, right? But...telling ppl to be humble isn't going to discourage the narcissists but rather the humble, slightly-too-introspective nerd from talking about their writing. The beautiful thing about writing is that if your writing is good, and you know it's good, then IT'S _GOOD_. I think in writing sem, for some ppl it's really easy to try to be overly humble about stuff you write bc other ppl read it.

* for the writing noobs (like i was and still partially am tbh): people don't write enough. the class has a ton of revising the same paper over and over again to the point where it feels awful to read, whereas when you're first starting the strategy that generally worked for me was to aim at being prolific, not at writing a single best piece. I didn't know where the bottlenecks were going to be until I wrote and revised 11 thousand words across nine essays in a week for fun. Obviously that was a bit overkill for most people and I'm at a much more sustainable pace now, but that short period of time taught me a lot about it that I'd never have learned otherwise.",13,,False,ff5wvi7,False,False,1579612940.0,2020-01-21 07:22:20

With that said, it doesn't quite reduce down to finding people with shared interests. That seems to work for consumption stuff where you just search online for whoever, but for creative hobbies the first step appears to be to create. I've found it easier to make friends who have shared creative interests with me when I already have a body of work to show them. And it's this different approach to finding people that makes me want to draw a line between the two and not reduce the people-finding process to ""just look for people who like what you like.""

Fair point about consumption hobbies being more popular, comparing the number of musicians to the number of Netflix-watchers for instance. With that said, it's been my experience that there are tons of scenes hidden in plain sight for the creative-hobby-folks; the tricky part at first is to find where they are.

"Anyone ever approach girls on campus, make small chat then ask for their number, IG or snap?",graciechu,"as a girl idk how i feel about this tbh

it's lowkey terrifying to have a random dude come up to me and talk to me when i'm alone, especially on an open city campus where i have no clue if you're a student or not. if a random person tried to talk to me on locust i would turn up my music and start walking faster lmao. people will either think you're trying to sell them something... or you might get pepper sprayed. at best you're going to get a bunch of fake phone numbers.

there have been so many cases where women literally get murdered for ignoring a catcaller or turning a guy down that even if i think you're probably a nice guy, the fear is still there in the back of my mind.

if you're going to do this (which you probably shouldn't) : don't do it anywhere that a girl would feel cornered/like she doesn't have some way to escape. make sure you're not blocking her path or trapping her. if someone says no, back down immediately. don't press her, don't persist, don't pester, it just makes her perception of you WAY worse and you're definitely getting a fake phone number.

there are way better ways to meet people. i get it, dating apps are bullshit. but join clubs, talk to people in your classes, make friends in your hall. even just asking to sit at someone's table at houston or starbucks and starting up a light conversation if they're not too busy would be better. best way is by making friends, so you can expand your network, meet more people, and organically make connections. you'll probably have more success with someone who knows you as a mutual friend of someone they trust than with someone who only knows you as a stranger.",57,,1577135502.0,fbshdtk,False,False,1577055241.0,2019-12-22 16:54:01

Colleges Hoped for an In-Person Fall. Now the Dream Is Crumbling.,InternationalCupcake,">Such announcements have been [widely predicted](https://www.chronicle.com/article/This-Will-Be-One-of-the-Worst/249128), even as some presidents declared that they planned to bring students back for fall classes. [In planning to reopen](https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Great-Reopening-Debate/249014),  colleges have cited the benefits to in-person learning, the disparities  in technology access off campus, and detailed safety plans. There is  also a clear [financial incentive](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Next-Candidate-for-the-Fall/249155) to bring students back; fees for housing and dining are significant portions of operating budgets.  
>  
>But  in the face of rising cases nationally, and as faculty and students  raise safety concerns, colleges have said they can’t pull it off.  
>  
>The Bay Area, Christ said, is not “at a phase at which higher education is permitted to open under public-health orders.” And [earlier this month,](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/07/08/social-gatherings-produce-increase-in-student-covid-19-cases/) Berkeley announced 47 new student cases in one week, with most connected to Greek parties.  
>  
>Berkeley  typically has 6,000 classes in the fall, but the university was  planning to offer only about 300 face-to-face classes in a hybrid model,  Christ said. In-person instruction, Christ said, would have been  reserved for courses that would be difficult to replicate online,  including complex labs, performing arts, and field work. But the  prospect of students, faculty, and staff members returning in the fall  constituted what Christ and her team began to describe as a “mass  migration event.”

What do you like about online Penn classes?,Realistic-Storm,"PROS

Some exams (depending on the class) are open book/open notes and though the exams may be longer or more in depth, some professors give you much more time than normal. 

I liked the flexibility of online lectures that were pre-recorded since I could go at my own pace and pause as I saw needed. Actual zoom meetings for me seemed pointless for some classes, but I only had one zoom lecture-based class and the rest was just based off of pre-recorded material. 

I definitely liked the aspect of being at home. My first semester was definitely an adjustment period and I spent most of my time in the library and ended up doing miserably anyways. I got my shit together at the beginning of the second semester and managed to do really well even on campus and when we came home I found it a little easier ish to focus on doing school/studying since

 A) didn't have to worry about my schedule clashing with my roommate   

B) sweats literally everyday 

C) I was able to sleep more, but also put more time and effort into work when I felt like it was necessary

 D) was more inclined to attend zoom office hours 

E) the comfort of knowing that you're kind of in your own space and as a freshman no more dining halls and communal showers and more room to actually practice self-care when you need it

CONS

In order to really do well in online classes, discipline is definitely a must. It's easy to procrastinate and push things off when you're at home. I found myself waking up early and cracking out my work before the afternoon slump or working later at night when there was no distractions around. 

Another con is missing human connection. I barely had friends/acquaintances freshman year since I was in a study slump and I was glad most of my hs friends were home when I was as well, but quarantine made it impossible to see them. If we are indeed online, I definitely would hope for study dates with friends and such

One last con: lack of ECs. Some of my activities were able to shift online, but I was left without a bunch of clinical work and research which could definitely hurt me in the future when it comes to grad school.",18,,False,fszjevu,False,False,1591374464.0,2020-06-05 11:27:44

I really got to see what his research is about and what his interests are. I am not an anthro major, so i really enjoyed getting this perspective.

My in-major classes were all seminars, and I enjoyed the more casual vibe of our meetings.

I got accepted to do a Master’s degree in the Fall. I will be deferring to Spring 21 so I can start on January. I’m an international student, and just want to make sure I get the best possible experience, as I’ve worked hard to get accepted in Penn. 

I weighted my options: 

Going in the fall where I could possibly not have the full experience, or wait a couple of months more that perhaps could guarantee that I get what I’m looking for.

If deferring meant to wait ANOTHER YEAR, I would start this September even if it ends up being online, there’s no way I’m waiting that much. But for what is essentially about 3 months more, I am willing to wait.

If sh*t hits the fan in the following months, and somehow the situation hasn’t improved by then, I will try my best to go in January, or as a last resort, I will start online. Here’s hoping this won’t be the case!",5,,False,fsdk6zi,False,False,1590887362.0,2020-05-30 20:09:22

"What do you guys think about the Fall 2020 semester? Will it be online, hybrid, or in-person?",kendell212,"If you’re an incoming international student, there’s not even a guarantee that you’ll be able to come into the country. Visa appointments across the world are on hold and people are still trying to get their I-20s. To qualify for CPT, you do need to be present on campus for one academic year. However, certain programs allow you to do CPT before one academic year and you can check with your school to know if your program qualifies. Therefore, trying to come for the fall semester to meet the requirement of one for academic year makes sense. Many international students have already notified their schools and programs and deferred. 

Gutmann’s been really vague with these emails lately... but I hope the fall semester will be in person. I want to see everyone again! However, more and more it seems unlikely. Most international students who make up more than 30 percent of the student body are still waiting for their documents to be processed and shipped and even then there’s no guarantee they’ll be able to get a visa appointment (some countries need to wait until late August which leaves no time to receive a visa). And then the travel ban complicates things even more. It would be unfair for internationals to be excluded from the fall semester if classes were held in person. I do hope things get better. 😢❤️

My advice would be, you should wait and try to fulfill all your requirements (I-20, F-1 visa, pay the SEVIS fee, etc) if you’re able to with the chance you’ll be able to enter the country. If you manage to get the visa, but can’t enter the country, then the visa will still be valid and you could defer if you wanted to. The last day to defer is the day before classes begin for most programs and you’ll be issued a new I-20.",2,,1590989104.0,fshxhrv,False,False,1590988150.0,2020-06-01 00:09:10

What to wear to frat parties,karma_cloud,"The style changes depending on warm weather&Darties (daytime parties) to the fall and winter. 

Girls usually wear shorts and a crop top and white frat sneakers/vans/converse in warm weather.

Most girls have a “fracket” (frat jacket) that is cheap and you don’t mind bringing for the walk from your dorm to the party and possibly losing or having stuff spilled on it when you’re in the party. 

Guys wear more preppy stuff like shorts and a t shirt or tank during warm weather. Sperries or sneakers/vans. In cold weather just jeans and a t shirt, idk maybe khakis? I’m not a guy so I’ll defer to the male stylists out there. 

Overall, definitely casual. Stuff you don’t mind getting drinks spilled on and shoes stepped on. Girls tend to be in more revealing outfits but absolutely wear what you feel comfortable wearing.

Questions about Penn Clubs,PM_ME_FAVORITE_PUN,"Clubs usually meet on weekends or sometimes a weeknight. Depends on the club but definitely the higher end consulting clubs can have under 10% acceptance rate if not a lot of current members leave. I believe all the clubs you listed aren't quite as selective, but still wouldn't be a breeze. Applications will be due around the end of September (used to be earlier but Wharton made it a policy to stop people from stressing). You can start applying for bigger positions as soon as freshman spring, after being a general member of the club or board for a semester. Honestly most of club leadership except for the president/vp are usually sophomores. 

Wharton clubs are far from the only way to be involved your freshman year, though -- Greek life, intramural sports, cultural/for-fun clubs, and dance teams are some other activities I personally think are more exciting/rewarding than Wharton clubs. Two or three clubs is probably plenty.",6,,False,erc0310,False,False,1560699107.0,2019-06-16 10:31:47

Questions about Penn Clubs,TauntyBird,"Penn has a SAC (Student Activities Council) fair early on in the fall semester (and I think again in the spring) where all the clubs line up on Locust Walk and students can talk to people from clubs they are interested in and sign up for their email lists. Then individual clubs will start sending emails about first meeting dates and such. At the first meetings clubs usually go over the application process (if there is one). You can usually apply for positions in the club even as a freshman, the timeframe might be different based on the club though. 

I didn’t really join any Wharton clubs my freshman year, but I did join:

PClassic - Upenn’s high school programming contest organizers

UPGRADE - Game development club

SIGGRAPH - Upenn’s computer graphics club

Chinese Students Association (CSA) (went to some meetings)

Wharton Asia Exchange (WAX) (went to some meetings)

Penn Blockchain (went to some meetings)

Club meetings can take place at any time, but my 3 main clubs mostly met on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. CSA, WAX and blockchain had meetings or talks during weekdays but usually after classes.

How much time you want to put into clubs is up to you! Personally I spent anywhere from 6-10 hrs per week on all my clubs, maybe more if there were some social events. I also had personal hobbies I kept up with like drawing, and on the side I taught coding to middle schoolers every Tuesday. I would say feel free to sign up for/join as many clubs as you want, then narrow them down and just go to/apply to the ones you really care about. Also free food is a great incentive to hear about a club even if you are not sure about joining 😉",4,,False,erby1mg,False,False,1560697438.0,2019-06-16 10:03:58

Questions about Penn Clubs,gingerdg,"1. Yes, almost all clubs require an application. The exceptions are generally cultural groups (ex. CSA, PTS), SPEC (event planning branch of PSG), and major-related groups (ex. IRUSA, UES, Neuroscience). ""Exclusive"" depends on what you mean- all clubs are looking to actively recruit new members. The acceptance rates into clubs vary wildly. You likely will not get into everything but you should be able to find something

2. SAC fair for all clubs is early in the year although recruiting starts pretty much when you get onto campus. Many orgs will host late nights during NSO and other events.

&#x200B;

3. Varies- generally one chapter meeting, one committee meeting, and project work. 

At what time do clubs occur? Before classes, lunch, after classes? Or all three?

&#x200B;

4. Yes, be a member for at least one semester before applying for an executive board position. If you ever have doubts, ask one of the upperclassmen members. They will be happy to guide you.

5. Depends on the person, the advising office tells you 2-3, but many students do more or less depending on the luck of the draw during applications. Apply for what you would be interested in actually doing because likely not every club will accept. Clubs are great communities on campus and are awesome ways to meet other freshmen.",2,,False,ercspx0,False,False,1560720935.0,2019-06-16 16:35:35

Questions about Penn Clubs,gingerdg,"yep- you don't have to join whatever club you get accepted to. However, if you become known for doing that it can damage your application. For example, if you apply and get into a small club, and then for some reason back out, its possible if not likely that one of the people from that club or their friend can be interviewing you later on. The applications for the clubs are long enough though that you should only fill them out for the clubs you are legitimately interested in.

  
Some clubs limit re-applications. If you ever are thinking of reapplying, ask a current club member who you trust. See if they will support your application in the internal review or if you are not who they are looking for",2,,False,erecil6,False,False,1560780520.0,2019-06-17 09:08:40

Math 114 help,cool-beans-934,"Ahh I would be hesitant with everything you are reading here as the advice is outdated (sorry guys). Let me speak based on the new format that is the case in all MATH 114 classes.

For upperclassmen, Math 114 is now entirely based on what the Engineering section used to be. You will be watching Prof/g's videos and solving quizzes.

Structure-wise, you start off by learning about vectors, lines and planes. You look beyond the third dimension at times. Then you jump into a little bit of linear algebra before turning back to traditional calculus concepts in Volumes 2, 3 and 4 using some tools from Volume 1.

Do not feel like you should know this stuff - it is perfectly fine if you don't know and the expectation is that you don't. But if you watch the videos, attend lecture, recitation, do the prepQuizzes, utilize office hours where needed, you should be fine. That being said, the pace of the class is \*very\* fast so you will need to keep up (especially for the weekly quizzes).

Also, some students may have seen some components of this course in high school, as with nearly all intro classes at Penn. That knowledge won't be as helpful with the new model due to the extensions into linear algebra. Sure, you will need to work harder, but everyone will have to put in similar hours a week.",3,,False,g3zb2j0,False,False,1599225948.0,2020-09-04 08:25:48

Advice on returning to campus,4dwncrossedswordspzl,"I definitely relate to how you’re feeling—I’m also a senior and this is a decision I’ve been trying to make too but everyday I seem to change my mind on whether or not to go back. I also live in an off campus apt. with two friends and have a pretty good home life, so if I were to go back it would be to spend time with my roommates (we’ve all agreed to only socialize with each other) and to be close to the library to check out books (for my history thesis). But even then, most (likely all) of my classes have already sent out a notice that they’ll be conducted online, so if I were to go back, I’m also concerned that my roommates and I will get stir-crazy. Most importantly, I’m really worried that I might get sick and unintentionally spread the virus to one of my roommates/anyone really. This last point is something that has lately made me stick more strongly to the side of staying at home. I’ve tried to think about the long run (lol which is a hard thing for me to do) and given that the fall semester is really only around 3 months, I think that the friendships I’ve made with my roommates will still be strong even without those 3 months and that my schoolwork wouldn’t suffer too much in that period. Of course, this viewpoint is strongly tied to the hope that we’ll definitely be on campus for the spring, but sadly that isn’t a guarantee. 

But again, everybody’s different and might have different reasons for going back. I’ve read a lot of posts online on other threads about deciding whether or not to go back, and a lot of the time people will say not to because going back is selfish. I think there’s a lot to unpack there—I do think it’d be selfish if a person were to go back and socialize without respecting any social-distancing protocols whatsoever. But otherwise, I personally think that there are a lot of legitimate reasons for why someone should go back (and properly social distance!). It could be because they have a bad family life, their mental health would be much better if they went back, they’d be able to focus a lot better on academics (e.g. where doing well could be important for earning scholarships), etc. It’s also our senior year—lots of people are going back to try and enjoy what little time we have left as college kids, and I think that can also be a valid reason as long as people do it safely. So I would try to consider these things about yourself, e.g. academics, mental health, etc., as well as weigh that against the (potentially) heightened risk of getting sick and hopefully you’ll be able to make the best decision for you. I think one comforting thought is that it’ll most likely be okay either way you decide—we’ll get past these next couple of rough months and hope for the best after that.",14,,False,fyc7q0q,False,False,1594971551.0,2020-07-17 02:39:11

The TLDR of my thoughts on the matter:

Given what you described above, it would 100% be safer for everyone if you stayed home and not come back, and coming back would indeed be a selfish act. I empathize with you, it's not a situation I would want to be in at your age and I'm sure I'd have the same thoughts back then. But this is a time where we all need to make personal sacrifices for the greater good of the health of the community.

Transferring into M&T,mureytasroc,"CIS major in SEAS here.

I had a 4.0 GPA (more A+s than As) in my freshman year, took very challenging courses (spring semester was rajiv CIS 121, ESE 301, MATH 240, a grad level CIS class, a wharton class, and a half credit CIS class).  Had lots of AP credit so I could have completed the M&T coursework without ever overloading.  Was heavily involved in a few programming for social good and Wharton clubs.  Had other extracurriculars and put a lot of effort into my app.

I didn’t even get to the interview stage of the M&T transfer process (was recently rejected).  The fact is it’s so competitive that there’s really nothing you can do to secure a good chance of getting in (especially from CIS).  No matter what you do, it will be a Hail Mary.  That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t apply, just make sure you don’t obsess over it or expect to get in.  At the end of the day you can still take interesting/useful classes at Wharton as free electives no matter what.  And you are already at Penn so you don’t need to do any more clout chasing.

Enjoy your freshman year, make new friends, work hard in your classes, and do extracurriculars you enjoy.  If you want, you can apply to M&T because why not.

You’re also required to take 5 courses for your concentration, and the PPE department is very flexible in terms of what counts.

What are your perspectives on this?,hhammoud23,"As someone who also chose Penn over Michigan, I think a lot of it is based on their personal experience and isn’t really representative of the school as a whole. Many of their statements are true to an extent, but it’s easy to feel like Penn and the world as a whole are against you and blow things out of proportion.

For example, the food at Penn is atrocious, but I spent a week at Michigan for a program and their food/dorms were not much better, if at all. My advisors were difficult to handle at first, but that’s mainly because they have dozens of cocky kids coming in at the start of each year trying to make the same stupid mistakes (I want 7 classes! I want a dual degree!)

Also, OP says that most kids at Penn are cold and pre-professional. While I can’t argue that statement, I think that you will find your people in the places you are meant to be.

Important Changes to Our Operations for the Remainder of the Semester

 

The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, presents our world, country and University with a unique public health challenge that is all the more disquieting because of the uncertainties associated with its spread.  We write today with the latest update on the additional steps we at Penn will take in dealing with this unprecedented challenge, guided by current data and expert advice.  We will continue to communicate with you and update our plans as new data and evidence emerges.  Our primary goals, as always, are carrying out our educational, research and clinical care missions while ensuring the health and safety of our students, faculty, staff and visitors.

 

To help us achieve these goals under demanding conditions, we are compelled to make major changes to the final weeks of the semester.  We take these steps after much deliberation and with a determination to ensure that our students continue to receive the finest education in the world.  This cannot come without disruption in the normal routine of things.  Together we will work our way through these difficulties, guided by the inimitable spirit that makes this University so special.

 

The COVID-19 virus is readily spread through close human contact, which is a fact of life in a university environment, whether in classrooms, dining halls or at University events.  Eliminating large gatherings and creating social distancing are important steps to help prevent the spread of the disease.

 

To achieve that, we are announcing these measures:

 

•                     Spring Break is being extended for one week for all students, except for those students in health-related Schools and programs in which Spring Break has already occurred or who are actively engaged in clinical rotations.  During this time, the University will complete planning to migrate all classroom teaching to virtual instruction for both undergraduate and graduate classes beginning Monday, March 23rd.  Virtual instruction will continue through the remainder of the spring semester including examinations.  Graduate and professional Schools will notify their students about their specific schedules.

•                     In the critically important interest of public health, if at all possible, students who are currently out of town should not return to campus.  Students who are on campus should depart effective Sunday, March 15th.  University staff will be available and do their best to assist departing students.  We will work with students in the College Houses or University housing who do not come back to campus from Spring Break to facilitate the return of their belongings.  We will support those students living in the College Houses or University housing who are absolutely unable to return home for personal reasons.  For students on financial aid, we will work with you to ensure you are supported in this emergency transition.

•                     Medical, Dental, Veterinary and some Nursing students will continue their clinical rotations. Information about clinical experiences will be handled separately by the Schools and details will soon be provided in a separate communication from the respective Deans.

•                     Guidance on completion of labs and other non-classroom academic activities for graduate and professional students will be provided by each school.  PhD students who are on dissertation status or have completed their coursework will be advised separately in consultation with their graduate deans and the Vice Provost for Education, as we recognize individual research is different from classroom education.

•                     We are actively working with departments and programs at the undergraduate level to ensure comparable academic experiences are provided virtually.

•                     Whether students remain on campus or return home, all classes will be provided by virtual instruction, and on-campus activities will be limited.

 

Many details are still being finalized, so we ask for your patience as we work through the myriad issues involved in this major temporary change.  There will be ongoing communications as more details unfold.  We are determined that our efforts will be guided by a commitment to fairness in helping students complete the semester as seamlessly as possible.  We will work diligently to ensure that every Penn student continues to receive a high-quality Penn education, and to ensure that graduating students can do so on time and without delay or interruption.  As disruptive as this might be on the surface, we will do everything in our power to minimize its interference with learning, which is the reason we are all here.

 

The University has created a website (https://coronavirus.upenn.edu) to answer many of the questions you will have about this decision.  We will be vigilant in keeping the site updated as new events move forward.  Should you have questions not answered by this information, please email Coronavirus@upenn.edu.

 

Faculty with specific academic questions can receive guidance from their School Deans. Staff should not hesitate to contact their managers or the Penn Solutions Center at 215-898-7372 or [www.solutioncenter.upenn.edu]www.solutioncenter.upenn.edu.

 

In this stressful time, we want to remind all students that there are extensive support resources available.  One call to the HELP LINE can assist you in finding personal and mental health support.  Similarly, faculty and staff always have access to Penn’s Employee Assistance Program: https://www.hr.upenn.edu/PennHR/wellness-worklife/counseling-and-employee-assistance-program.

 

Our thanks to everyone at Penn who has contributed to the planning for the remainder of the semester.  This is a unique and difficult challenge.  To get through, we need to work together and look out for each other along the way.  We are one Penn community, we will continue to be one Penn community, and we are grateful for your partnership in helping us make the remainder of this semester a productive and healthy one for all of our students.

 

With all best wishes,

Stouffer is one of the less popular dorms because it has fewer people and is one of the less social dorms. But the vast majority of the rooms are singles, so if you put that as your first or second choice, you’d have a really high chance of getting a single. Stouffer’s right next to the Quad, so the proximity to dining halls and classes is about the same. Stouffer is super clean, and almost all of the bathrooms are rooms with a toilet, sink, and shower. They’re really clean, and you can close the door to the entire bathroom and have privacy. There are kitchens in every section (there are 6 sections) plus a main kitchen in the seminar room but ~24 people share each section kitchen.

single room as an incoming freshman?,an4lf15ter,"Yeah it is very possible! When it comes to facilities Lauder College House is probably the best, where you live in a suite but everyone gets their own room. Hill, Kings Court English, and LCH all have their own dining hall. Quad has one too but the food is pretty gross. English and most Quad rooms have sinks in them which are really convenient. Kings Court has a walk in closet which is nice if you have a lot of clothes I guess. Hill rooms are really small, even the doubles but the facilities are nice and it’s possible to just eat there every day. Gregory doesn’t have air conditioning which really sucks for the first few months but it’s in a suite style so you only need to share your bathroom with your suite mates like Lauder. Quad is kind of old but the rooms are nice, the bathrooms are the worst of the dorms but honestly aren’t that bad.

Best freshman dorms and work study jobs?,dftmckeon,"A lot of the stuff you’re mentioning depends on the person. 

In terms of dorming, I think that the Quad is pretty great for social reasons, but that Lauder and Hill are better locations for your classes and higher quality.

Lots of people have different perspectives on dining halls and meal plans. If you go 3x everyday, do the middle plan. If you think you’ll skip breakfast or something every now and then and want to buy coffees with dining dollars, do the least swipes plan. I did the least swipes plan and still ended with extra swipes. Some people say Hill is the best and others prefer 1920s commons. You’ll have to figure that out for yourself, but if you’re living at Hill, you’ll probably eat there most often.",11,,False,fbprual,False,False,1577024409.0,2019-12-22 08:20:09
Best freshman dorms and work study jobs?,catullusallust,"In KCECH, you apply to the dorm as a whole but can’t specify KC or English: KC has huge rooms, bay windows, and pretty good community (I stayed there my freshman year) but is considerably older than English and has communal bathrooms (3 per floor: men’s, women’s, gender neutral). English is newer, most rooms have sinks, but the rooms are smaller. It also has communal bathrooms. The dining hall in KCECH is good but small + odd hours.

Hill is also newly renovated, but the rooms are tiny (no more than 2-3 feet between beds). The bathrooms are communal but in a different way, with actual rooms with toilets/sinks/counters and separate shower rooms, all with doors, instead if stalls. It’s also way bigger than KCECH. The dining hall is nice with good hours but the menu is boring. 

I loved KCECH even if I didn’t have air (they do now). 

As far as cheap winter clothes, thrift stores are a good bet. Second Mile Center on 45th and Walnut, Penn Closet on Campus in Williams, or Philly AIDS in South Philly all have cheap clothes options.

Best freshman dorms and work study jobs?,hongbaabaa,"If you can get into New College (Lauder now I guess), I would. You have personal air conditioning that actually works like its supposed to. The bathrooms are private (you clean them yourselves) so if you're diligent about that your bathroom can be spotless. The other dorms have AC as well but I know my friends at Hill complain about it being stuffy and hot all the time. 

An $80 Columbia jacket will totally suffice. It's worth it to invest in it. 

New College + Hill + KCECH are probably the closest to your IR classes. 

As far as work studies you can have a rather involved high skill work study, or you can just work at the library or front desk at a building. The high skill ones might pay better and can give you some nice experience to put on a resume/ especially if you're interested in the subject. The latter is easier and you can usually do homework during the work study. There's an entire database of work study jobs so I'm sure you'll be able to find one that you like. I work at Penn law and it's fantastic. 

Dining: 

Hill has the most options but quality is worst (IMO)

NCH/ Lauder has a premium meal swipe thing (the same as the cost of a normal meal swipe, it's just one swipe) and the food can be pretty fancy. They have steak/pork chop/ seafood risotto/ duck, etc. etc. They change it up a lot. The thing here is that you only get one plate of the premium swipe meal, and there are a couple limited options in the NCH buffet (pizza/salad/ice cream/ vegetarian option) 

KCECH is the best dining hall in my opinion (plus the staff is super nice!)

1920 Commons delivers baseline college food like chicken nuggets/ pizza etc. at a good quality. You won't find anything fancy here but they do it decent. 

They also have late night meal exchanges at NCH between 8-12. Pretty good options here.",3,,False,fbx0rca,False,False,1577165046.0,2019-12-23 23:24:06

Best freshman dorms and work study jobs?,Jamesjet3,"Honestly each dorm has its own charm and you’ll likely enjoy your experience wherever you end up. I’m in the Quad and love the social aspect of it. Plus you cannot best the scenery/historical aspect of it. I mean I think it’s really cool to think that over a century’s worth of students have lived in our rooms— there aren’t too many places where you can say you roamed the same halls as figures like John Legend and Rod Rosenstein. 

I think Hill is good for the kids who are social but don’t like to party as much. But I have lived in Ware for a semester without partying so if you’re worried about getting caught up in party culture, don’t be concerned. They have a pretty well-patronized dining hall there.,

Kings Court is far away from most things but they have a bomb dining hall that a lot of people seem to forget about. Can’t really comment on social life there, but I think it’s a pretty close-knit community since it’s smaller than the other college houses.

Lauder is really modern and nice but it’s definitely not for everyone. If you’re looking for the Classic college dorm experience, Lauder may fall short of your expectations because it’s more like living in a hotel/fancy apartment building than a college dorm. That’s just my observation and I could be totally wrong but check out what others have to say before deciding for/against it. They also have a dining hall there, but I kind of don’t like it (total bias here lol)

Gregory/Du Bois are pretty similar to kings court  but they are farther away from where you’ll have most of your classes. 

Everything will have air conditioning by next year, so that shouldn’t be a concern. Laundry is free everywhere, there is cable tv almost everywhere if you want that. Sinks are very random— some rooms have them others don’t. I wanted a sink and didn’t get one but I’ve had no problem— just shave/brush teeth/wash up/fill water bottle in the common rooms/bathroom. 

To talk about work-study— 

The best jobs for a freshman are probably ones where you can do some of your homework studying while there. 

I know some of the dorms have student staff, so that’s always a good option. Lots of freshies go for the library as well! 

I wouldn’t go for a research position your first semester because it’s another stress/time commitment on top of what you’re already going to be going through as you adjust to life at penn.

Leave your ego/bad vibes about these people at the door and only give up on any of these after a half-semester evaluation of whether these are helping you or not.

During NSO, the vibe is generally inclusive and with the right group is a lot of fun. While you may be nervous, you warm up to them and they can be quite fun.

\^sums it up. A couple of notes: definitely be careful about consumption if its your first time, because they tend to pour more for freshmen. Also, be careful who ends up behind you, cuz yes people will be drunk and want to ""meet"" you, and NSO can be a vulnerable time for ""micro"" sexual assault. Know that you can say no, and always go in with a group and leave with at least one person who ideally are looking after you

Combined with the pre-professionalism of Penn due to Wharton, most students will drop the pre-med track after taking these classes, so you need to know that you don't be discouraged from your GPA.

As for campus climate, I love Penn because it's genuinely so friendly and spirited. Personally, I got involved in a lot of diverse organizations and was able to connect across campus that way, but I also met some of my closest friends by just striking up a conversation at a dining hall or the library.

Make a point to talk to people before/after EVERY class - even if it's about things you think might be lame it's better than nothing at all and eventually you'll get to the more interesting conversation - ask where they're heading and walk with them if it's on the way. Do homework with people (this is a big one I wish I started doing more earlier). Ask people to lunch/dinner. Ask someone if they want to go do that thing in center city that you've been wanting to do.

"Is getting rejected from 90+% of the clubs normal, or am I below average?",Phil_Pennster,"Very saddened to hear of your experience, OP, because it reminds me of the painful times I have felt the same way.  The actions and selections of exclusive clubs cannot be defended, and they have many characteristics in common with the bullying behavior that is only recently getting the attention it deserves in grade school.

All that being said, however, it is appropriate to put this problem in context and consider a couple of other perspectives.  First, this problem is representative of life.  If we could somehow magically eliminate the problem on our campus, we would inevitably encounter it in the world beyond and after Penn.  That does not in any way excuse or justify the behavior of clubs at Penn, but it merely acknowledges that the problem is not confined to Penn.  We will inevitably encounter club-like, and even bully-like behavior in our workplaces and in our communities.  What do we do about it?  I suppose we can learn how to avoid, adapt, or live with it.  If so, then is Penn a place where we should expect to be free from such challenges, or where we should learn to meet them?  I have acquiesced to the latter as part of why I hope to learn here.

Second, there is a rising tide of political correctness on the nation's elite college campus [(viz. the Christakis controversy at Yale)](http://reason.com/blog/2016/09/14/video-more-crazed-yale-students-attack-s).  The core question is whether one person has freedom to speak when that speech is perceived as hurtful to someone.  One might as well apply that to the club actions and selections described by the OP, which are clearly and truly hurtful to some.  Unfortunately, the situation at Yale has degenerated into name-calling and mob-like behavior - unworthy of an institution that should be at the forefront of answering the core question.  I earnestly hope that Penn does not follow suit.",6,,False,d7q0kvp,False,False,1474073218.0,2016-09-16 19:46:58

Routes 11, 34 and 37 ran through the Penn campus on Woodland Avenue and Locust Streets for nearly 65 years. In 1956, the trolley route was buried to enable the university to unify its campus.

Let's get a list of Penn Problems. I'll start.,MyPlantsHaveNames,"I agree that Penn's police force is seemingly omnipresent on campus and, in that way, does a great job of preventing crime on students. But, does an enlarged police force always work to stifle crime in areas of high-crime? I believe that the area near campus is generally low-crime, and particularly low in violent crime.

The trolleys are a completely separate entity from the university, as evident in your quote. Regardless, they are a positive force in community connectedness. They continue on to the 40th street terminal and branch out from there, servicing a large chunk of West Philly. While Penn students living in center city or West Philadelphia benefit immensely from the trolleys, the benefit from the trolleys is most palpable for residents of West Philadelphia. How would this garner negative association with the University? 

When mentioning why there was not an uproar when Penn displaced homeowners West of 38th St.: 

>This [non-uproar] upholds the notion that homeowners were given fair market value and renters found adequate housing elsewhere.   
>

I think while using eminent domain can damage the university's relationship with the surrounding community, it is a trade-off. The areas where residents were displaced are now home to a plethora of businesses and dorms full of students to finance those businesses. The transition from a commuting school to a residential school that followed the purchase of land west of 38th street ultimately benefited the community through economic stimulation. 

As for professors living outside of the city, I think that statement is unfounded unless you have applicable data. Regardless, I was more commenting on the employment of non-academic employees and how local residents benefit from the university's growing need for employees [to satiate the growing student body and growing campus].

Have you ever walked from campus to 69th Street Station? Probably not. Just like Mantua. No affluent Penn faculty member wants to live in that expanse of West Philadelphia, especially with children.

Closer to campus, the Penn Alexander School has transformed the demographics of the area. Clearly gentrified. Why? No penn faculty would want their kid to go to Sayre HS. I volunteered there last semester. Bet you didn't know that many taps there are spray painted red so that students know which water is safe to drink. 

>Testing of drinking water for lead has been conducted at all but one of 298 of Philadelphia's older school buildings, and so far, about 20 percent of the nearly 14,000 water outlets sampled have unsafe lead levels. The school district has shut off 594 drinking faucets and water coolers after they were found to have high lead levels, district officials told a City Council panel yesterday.

This is from an article nov 21, 2000. Ten years later? Still bad.

You think lead isn't a [problem](http://webgui.phila.k12.pa.us/offices/e/environmental/programs--services/lead-paint)? Thousands of kids get lead poisoning each year in Philadelphia.

Which faculty member is going to send their kid to a school with lead paint everywhere? Not my faculty. So they live somewhere with a better school, aka not west philadelphia, although that is starting to change with the Penn-Alexander school.

There are lots of other programs as well, but these make it really easy for students to get involved.

Tack on the fact that people will party regardless and there will be an outbreak within a few days. Even if not a lot of people are partying because of people's willingness to abide by the suggested 14 day quarantine. Even after that people are still going to do so. I say 3-4 weeks and we'll see cases skyrocketing.

Also, \~80% of the student population is projected to come back when surveying \~1000 students.

"If Possible, Please Stay Home this Fall for Your Safety and Others",singularreality,"""Folks who are prudent generally wouldn't return to campus"".  I respect your opinion completely.  I don't agree with it.   If the goal is that you, personally should not get infected or that you, personally, should not infect anyone else, then the only way to assure that is to stay home and quarantine and to do no more gathering etc... as compared to what you would have done if you had decided to attend Penn in person.  It is absolutely safer for you and those around you for you to be in an environment where you distance from others completely and that pretty much means stay home and stay away from everyone.  If the testing works... you test before you come to campus and you test when you arrive... and everyone starts off CV free except those that must quarantine and then you, for the most part, interact mostly with those that are very unlikely to be infected..  we have a good start.  If you go to campus and do the testing and you do not want to infect others then follow the testing guidelines and distancing guidelines and the mask wearing guidelines strictly (and some of you might want to put some peer pressure on each other for that, (more time on that then say the few of you that are social shaming each other for not being more politically correct than the next guy/gal).  If you all come together.. then it will be difficult for you to infect others and it will difficult for you to be infected.  Could you get infected, yes.  Is it rare for you to have a very serious illness from being infected, also yes.  Could you, also yes -- not to minimize this terrible risk (if you have a risk factor DO NOT COME TO CAMPUS)!  Is it possible for you to infect someone else, yes.  If you are living around those mostly in your age category, is it likely that you will not infect an older person, yes.  Do we expect a spike on campus even with the new guidelines etc?  I have to say that nobody knows but I do agree that there will be some infections and they need to be discovered early (that is what the regular sample testing is for --- it is frankly brilliant (if it works)).  

The precautions and steps being taken will likely severely restrict the spread of the disease unless persons simply do not give a crud and just do what they want anyway.  If those people are going to do what they want to do anyway, they are probably going to do that at home anyway.  I am grappling with the question that everyone seems to think is so clear which I do not think is clear which is:  Is it truly better to be at home. The density on campus obviously is very high, but what would it be like, health wise if you did not go back to campus?  For some, it is worse, not better... (if you go back to Texas of Florida right now for example or if you live in an apartment complex with many other persons in your particular apartment where several of the people work or go to school which might be open).  Ultimately, it is an individual decision based upon your risk, known and unknown, and balancing of two or three less than desirable choices.  This is serious stuff.  If you want to be safe for sure, and not infect others, for sure.. you gotta lock yourself down...  but where and how and what are you gonna due during that time and where are you getting your food and who are you living with and what are they doing and how big is your house.....?   Perhaps one can be prudent and return to campus... It depends on your particular situation.  Within a month of the campus opening, there will be enough testing to determine where this is heading and Penn could shut things down.  They could also expand and open up things because infections are way down... I agonize about this.. I don't mean to be didactic --I truly get more confused every day....but innovation and battling this thing with good practices and tried and true behaviors... will work --- maybe?

Penn projects $91M budget deficit for FY21 in addition to $47M loss from spring 2020,johnathanjones1998,"Notes from the article:

* for 2020-21 penn is projecting a $91M deficit. We're also ending 2019-20 year with a $47M loss.
* They mention some 15% increase in ugrad fin aid for 2020-21
* Endowment spending will increase by 3.7% to help minimize the 2020-21 deficit. Originally this deficit was supposed to be $148M, but they cut stuff (via hiring freeze, no salary increases, halting construction, restricting travel reimbursements) bringing it down to that $91M figure.
* Penn is more reliant on tuition (33% of budgeted income) compared to IvyPlus peers (23% of budgeted income)
* Penn will continue w/3.9% tuition increase for 2020-21.
* About 14% (quoted as less than 15% in the article) of penn's budget is paid by the endowment investment income (compared to 27% in IvyPlus Peers) and only 18% of the academic portion of the endowment is unrestricted (ie it isn't allocated to some endowed chair or grant).
* Penn will continue to follow its spending rule to ensure stable spending and purchasing power (so no more spending likely)
* Penn will likely see investment income downturn in 2021-22

Effectively this is a big statement that says ""hey kids, we're not going to spend any money"". There's also a nice big FAQ document here that goes into why Penn doesn't pay PILOTs.

I think best case we can expect is that Penn moves the deadline to the last day of classes.

Still, I personally think universal P/F is the best move here.

It's unfair to put the burden of choosing pass/fail on the students who are actually affected by the displacement, while giving the benefits of choosing the good grades that appear on your transcript (hence, altering your GPA) to those who aren't. Students who still do well in a universal pass/fail setting and want it to show it to professional schools can do so by explaining in their application, having their professors tell those schools what their grade would have been, showing it through their letters of recommendation, etc. Doing well in any semester takes effort, and this semester is no exception to that rule.

Wanting to raise a GPA for academic honors like Latin honors at graduation, Phi Beta Kappa, etc are selfish and readily dismissible as reasons to keep p/f (yet I've seen it a surprising amount!).

The fact that Harvard Med School put out a statement saying they won't take opt-in p/f requirements is irrelevant as far as I see it. They're the only school that I've seen put out something that says this, and I know people that have contacted many more med/grad schools that have all said they understand the circumstances and won't look down on it. So I do think this argument for universal p/f is very weak, and I'm surprised that the pro opt-in people haven't picked up on this more.

Double/triple A is entirely unreasonable. No respectable university will implement this policy, since it makes grades totally meaningless. Arguing for double/triple A just detracts from the legitimate and experimentally-substantiated case for universal p/f, since at this point even multiple schools in the Ivy League are using it. 

I'm stunned by the amount of people who are arguing that they were using this semester to raise their GPAs, so they want opt-in p/f. The fact that the College sent out an email that multiple FGLI students told them this and dismissed the massive burden placed on students that are affected by this is absurd. There is functionally no equality in the learning environments and resources that students have, and it's making college (largely) pay-to-win.

Joining clubs and teams?,,"There are plenty of non-competitive clubs at Penn.  Given the competitive nature of the debate society in worldwide events, it makes sense for them to be highly restrictive in the selection process.  I'm a current freshman and I had the most high school debate awards in the tri-state for a debate organization with 2500+ members, and even I got rejected from the debate society.  After hearing some things about the society after the fact, I was actually quite happy I didn't get into it.

If you're interested in non-competitive and informal debate, then the Polybian Society would be best for you.  It's like the debate society but without the competitive nature and all the negativity.  There's also the Penn Political Union, which is similar to the Polybian Society in that it is non-competitive, but its slightly more formal because, if selected to speak, you debate against well-known speakers (for instance Jeb Bush was the most recent speaker). The topics are restricted to politics in Political Union, while the topics are more philosophical in Polybian.  Anyone can join either of these clubs, and I've met some of my closest friends at Penn in the Political Union.

Depending on your interests, there will be clubs that are suited for you.  But if you expect to partake in teams and clubs for which there is a competition or an established hierarchy where you are being judged in the application process (i.e. executive board positions or limited membership spots), then yes, expect a competitive nature to that application process.

cis opportunities?,johnathanjones1998,"I'm guessing you're a freshman. If so, there are a few reasons you could be getting rejected from stuff. Going into details:

* For internships, you might be aiming too high/not at the right places as a freshman. Right now, it'd be a bit late for any of the big FAANG companies, but look into smaller startups. Big companies don't really do freshman internships unless they go through separate programs, but startups are willing to take anyone who codes if the startup is small enough. Plus you'll have a lot more ownership over a product in a smaller company. There's a CIS career fair that happens at the beginning of next sem I believe.  But there isn't really a huge pressure to get an internship freshman year. Just spend the summer building side projects or taking courses to get requirements out of the way.
* For Hack4impact, literally just make an interesting side project that is \_significant\_. I'm talking more than just a CIS final project. It should be something you build from scratch and intimately know why you made decisions in a certain way. You'd be in good shape for next year especially if you know how to make a functional full-stack react application with GraphQL + next js. They're looking for people who know JS intimately but have been losing talent to Penn labs. Similarly,  if you work on a solid web dev project, you can open yourself up to go into Penn labs as a developer.
* PennApps is just dead and very mechanical in some aspects. You have to put in your time in order to make a larger impact and its fairly bureaucratic. Idk if you're into that or not, if not just avoid it (note, I am biased against them since I didn't have a great experience in my year with them. that being said there are others who found it to be a great experience).
* TAing is fairly straightforward: spend time in the class w/current TAs + get an A. Once you get into higher  level courses, it's easier to become a TA if you get a good grade (since 100 lvls tend to have a ""who do you know"" component in hiring TAs).
* Research really depends. Bio labs will take anyone who knows how to program in R or some statistics python package. You won't be able to do hardcore cis research until you get into higher-level courses really (well you can...you just won't get much out of it).

If you are looking to take classes, take cis 19x (fill in ""X"" with whatever language you're interested in learning). Most of them will have a final project (esp javascript, python, android, ios) where you just build a project from scratch in that language. It's an easy way to get a side project under your belt.",14,,1575903959.0,fa9bum8,False,False,1575868135.0,2019-12-08 23:08:55

What should Madison Holleran or a student in a similar situation have done?,solo_monk,"I think everyone has made good points here so far. I think part of the problem is that at Penn and similar institutions, students are so insecure about their own intelligence and how they compare to others that they refuse to vent or open up to one another about the problems they're facing. I remember when I was at Penn (I was a sophomore when Madison died) and we would get an exam back, it was absolutely unheard of for anyone to tell you their grade. It was like we were all too scared to be seen as stupid if our grade was slightly lower than another student's, or below the average, or not high enough above the average for our own personal standards. 

Contrast that to this past year when I took some prereq courses at a community college, and it could not have been more different. After an exam all the students would ask each other what everyone got, and some kids would be like ""Damn yeah I got a 72, gotta study harder next time,"" or ""Wow I can't believe I got an 85 I really thought I was gonna fail."" It was just so much less stressful and less toxic than Penn, it really blew my mind. I don't know how it's possible to change that student culture at Penn, especially when everyone comes from a background of being the best of the best and that is likely what they formed their entire identities around. But I truly believe that is where most of the issues with depression and suicide lie at schools like Penn. It was definitely a major source of anxiety and depression for myself.

What should Madison Holleran or a student in a similar situation have done?,EulersPhi,"I agree with this. A lot of people struggle in college because they feel they are all alone, when in actuality like 90+% of the student body has similar thoughts about not living up to their potential. For me, joining a fraternity was the social scaffolding that I needed to help me be happy, for others it’s intramurals or just their close knit group of friends.

But also, I think that a lot of the stress and self-doubt that people go through in college is essential to becoming a resilient human. People don’t realize how intense and stressful and lonely college can be. After 18 years of being taken care of by your parents/family, you’re thrust into one of the biggest cities in the country and are forced to feed yourself, learn to socialize, complete harder coursework than you’ve ever been faced with, all while trying to develop and discover who you are. IMO college is one of the hardest things you will ever go through. But it’s also where you learn the most, about yourself and about the world, and I think it’s essential because of what you learn outside the classroom.

However, if you merely want to avoid making mistakes with your investment portfolio, which should be the first goal for all investing novices IMHO, find a fiduciary financial planner who will create a comprehensive goals plan with you. That plan should result in an asset allocation recommendation that maximizes the odds that you meet your goals given your risk tolerance. Asset allocation to broad diversified asset classes is about 85% of the battle in this regard.

Buffett has said you only need to read two chapters from the 1949 edition of that book to understand most of what you need to know as an investor: Chapter 2, which contains the parable of ""Mr. Market"" (behavioral finance) and Chapter 16 on the ""Margin of Safety"" (value investing).

Penn student researchers uncover the University's unaddressed ties to the slave trade,,"This is a very one-sided research project and article. The students appear to be intentionally going through Penn's history to find dirty laundry wherever it exists, rather than trying to tell a comprehensive story of Penn's involvement with slavery like they claim. Case in point: they only looked at the documents of 28 of the early trustees (so far — I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they will continue their research). I'm certain that these are people who their preliminary research revealed a) to have held slaves or b) to have been rumored to have held slaves. There were wealthy Pennsylvanians at the time of the founding of the University who held slaves, so that isn't really a surprise or interesting history.

Furthermore, this is only one part of Penn's so-called ""relationship"" with the institution of slavery. What about all of Penn students, faculty, and trustees who at one point in their lives were involved in the abolition movement? Pennsylvania being early to abolish the institution there are bound to be quite a few prominent citizens with ties to both the university and the cause of abolition.

Take for instance, Joseph Reed, who is listed as a slave-holder in this article. Nowhere does it mention that when Reed was governor in 1780 he was instrumental in passing the legislation which eventually abolished slavery in the state. This was some of first legislation of its kind making Reed and Pennsylvania pioneers in the cause of abolition. 

Ultimately, I fail to see the point of these sort of exercises in historical prospecting. It's anti-historical to go into the historical record for the sole purpose of seeking out transgressors against your modern conception of morality. These researchers are missing the forest for the trees. By refusing to tell an actual story about people, places, or events they omit all of the context that would give a full and accurate picture to Penn's nearly-non-existent ""association"" with slavery. If you go hunting for slave-owners in the 18th Century, you're going to find them, but that doesn't mean that Penn is somehow founded on slavery like this article seems to imply.",28,,False,dspgkvd,False,False,1516009276.0,2018-01-15 03:41:16

I believe clarifying this statement is important in its own right. Their thorough research is an important part of the story. Of course it was ""one-sided""--it had a specific purpose in mind. From the article, I don't see where they claimed to tell a ""comprehensive story"" (based on your flair you might know more about this than what is represented in the article?), but instead, as Dr. Brown is quoted in the article, 

>  “Penn as an institution has not thought, itself, about having a deep history of involvement in slavery,” she said. “These findings suggest that view might need to be altered.”  

To me, this seems like it's a solid research project that is furthering understanding about Penn's connection with slavery. ",3,,False,dspsjo2,False,False,1516031384.0,2018-01-15 09:49:44

What keeps you going?,,"A couple of things off the top of my head:

* Maintaining routine and sleep: These two go hand in hand. When I was at Penn I built a routine for myself and stuck to it with a pretty strict regularity. I made breakfast and had my coffee before class, ate lunch at one of a few favorite places, and knew in advance which nights of the week were for working and which for socializing. I found the regularity to be very reassuring. Some people might be different, but I am a creature of habit, I suppose.

    Central to all of this was sleep. In high school I slept poorly and irregularly for a lot of reasons, mostly because I didn't impose any discipline on myself. After high school I went hiking for a while and became addicted to a good night's sleep. At Penn, pretty much no matter what I was in bed by midnight every night. I consciously decided that if something was not done by then, it was definitionally of a lower priority than going to bed. Aside from very rare occurrences (1-2 times per semester) I refused to work late into or through the night.

* Having good, supportive friends. I spent most of my freshman year pretty miserable, in retrospect. At the time I didn't have enough context to really know it, but I didn't have a really strong social circle outside of my freshman hall and the few clubs I had joined turned out to either not be a strong enough community for me or to be a huge hassle. Protip: don't join the DP — they worked me to death for a semester before I quit and all of the awesome social experiences don't seem to include freshmen all that much. When I quit the DP, I joined a club that was much more my speed and had people who socialized with one another on a regular basis. I realized I was much happier because I was a part of a community that cared about me for more than the copy I could write. 

    Through my new organization I made pretty much all of my closest friends at Penn. It also served as a shelter from the pre-professional storm, since most of the people I was around weren't really interested in the ""who got the best internship"" game in all its mind-numbingly boring iterations.

* Not taking yourself too seriously: Very little of what you do at Penn is actually important. Obviously you should go to your classes and pay attention, etc. etc. The point is, you're preparing yourself to do something important down the line — its not intrinsically important. The same goes for your clubs and extracurriculars. Basically the highest stakes you'll ever face are whether or not people like the event you put on. It's not like we're talking life-and-death here (well, unless you're in MERT, in which case you should take your job seriously when you're on duty).

    So work hard and do well, but realize no one really cares how well you're doing besides you, so its okay to take a breather every once in a while (and not in a work-hard, play-hard kind of way — in an actually relaxing for a change kind of way). Don't get worked up feeling like you have to do everything all the time. Penn breeds some really bad ""keeping up with the Joneses"" attitudes about work, partying, and (perversely) stress. It's really helpful to separate yourself from that as much as possible.",12,,False,doqm0g5,False,False,1508707284.0,2017-10-22 16:21:24

However, I will say this is a tough issue for me to comment on, because I am white and might not have noticed issues of race that would be apparent to someone who is BIPOC.

However, that is not to suggest people who express racist views in diverse frats shouldn't face consequences and criticism.

I 100% agree with you that frats need to take active stances against toxic masculinity, both as part of their stated roles to better young men, and as part of their role as shaping campus culture. My comment wasn't intended to suggest that they shouldn't.

Sometimes I do wonder if Greek Life can even be saved. Is there a space for single gender-exclusive spaces inside the current culture? Or will they always perpetuate sexism, racism, homophobia, and discrimination based on wealth, just because they provide ""safe spaces"" for those opinions to be held without pushback? I don't know.

(Amy Wax) Penn Law Professor Wants to Make America White Again,Temper03,"I'm going to wade into this debate (and probably regret it) --

I'd just like to say that I've read Professor Wax's original comments, and I think there's a ton of desire-to-incite-a-reaction within them, especially given the context of the room she was saying them in.  I also recognize (from my friends in Law School) that dealing with the younger student body can be frustrating for a professor -- I've heard in particular that in Penn Law class debates, it's tough to find students willing to debate socially-frowned-upon viewpoints (such as anti-gay marriage legislation), even though a law school needs controversial debate to thrive.  Ok.

That being said, I strongly get the view that Professor Wax is purposefully making controversial off-the-cuff statements and then deflecting criticism through the wording -- as baiters on Reddit as known to do.  Do you want to argue that plenty of people in the world ""want to immigrate to countries led by white men""?  Sure -- but let's break that down, because a few years ago, America was led by a black man (""mixed"", but seen by the general public as ""black"").  Ireland and Portugal are led by elected people of half-Indian descent.

&#x200B;

So surely it's not just a matter of who's at the top, right?  And if someone is ***choosing*** to uproot their life to become an ethnic and/or linguistic minority -- historically a very ***very*** bad option -- surely it's because they value the same traits that those countries promote?  And what are those ""white"" values that they desire?  Equality before the law, anti-racism, progressiveness, human rights.... things that someone like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren really exemplifies.  So if someone thinks those traits are better than those in their home country, then sure, they want to move there.  That makes them more ""Western"" than people who live in a ""Western"" country but argue for a theocracy or dictatorship, right?

My parents were a religious minority in their home country, and so chose to come to America because they strongly believe that religious minorities should be protected.  I think that's **very** American.  I don't particularly care whether it's ""white"" or not, ""Western"" or not, call it whatever, but it's surely American.

Amy Wax has been known before for making inaccurate off-the-cuff statements and then deflecting criticism -- i.e. saying that ""no Black student has ever graduated in the top 25% of Penn Law"", and then deflected that statistic as ""an opinion"" when the dean of the Law School said that's certainly false.

There's an interesting study in Management Psychology from Dr. Johnson of UColorado that organizations that say they value diversity tend to look down on ""diverse"" workers as less-competent, because they assume that they ""cut the line"" to get in, even if they are objectively better-performing than non-""diverse"" workers.  You can see this in plenty of colleges, where minority students are often assumed to have ""gotten in"" based on affirmative action, even if their SAT scores for example are higher than the average at the college.

I think that's what's happened with Amy Wax -- she's a bit blinded by her belief that Penn's verbal commitment to ""diversity"" means that any non-white person in her class, regardless of achievement, is less than the white non-diverse student.  Of course, it's possible she's extrapolating her personal belief from her classroom (coupled with her frustration that even ""white"" students in Penn Law may be reluctant to argue conservative viewpoints) to the school, and nation, at large.",3,,1566666113.0,exzg0la,False,False,1566665531.0,2019-08-24 11:52:11

It is possible to double count and cross count enough to be able to graduate in four years. The lowest CU paths are about 43 CU, which is about 5-5.5 CU per semester.

* Virtually all street opioids are now fentanyl or stronger analogs. Pills are counterfeit. This is done at a level much higher than your dealer.
* Coke is intentionally adulterated with fentanyl, not merely cross-contaminated.
* Solid fentanyl is insidious. Such a small amount of powder can't be evenly mixed into a large batch, and there are so-called ""hot spots"". Your buddy does a line, their buddy does a line, and when you do yours, by chance, there's an extra grain that makes you OD.

- Even in the example screenshot, the Cafe at McClelland is spelled ""Cafe & McClelland"" and the description has an extra space at the beginning.
- The content is also lacking as a lot of food places are left out (e.g. Sitar, Qdoba, many campus cafés). This defeats the purpose of the app.
- Also, it would be ideal if the campus menus could be imported into the app instead of having the user be redirected to the web page. Menus of non-campus food options would also be nice to have.

Want to be friends?,Housesize3,"Wanted to take a moment to point out that this is among the most well-written ""want to be friends?"" posts I've ever seen, and definitely the best one I've seen on this subreddit. There are many ways to make friends on the internet that are less direct than ""want to be friends?"" but for anyone who does plan on writing something like this, take note: this is how it's done.

What I like most about the post is that it lists what OP likes, each interest a prompt that helps get the ball rolling. It contrasts quite a bit with many posts where there's no prompt beyond ""want frend"", which puts the responsibility on other people to not only reach out but somehow guess at how to start and hold a conversation.

Unpopular Opinion,Jamesjet3,"I have to agree. 

Wharton is the gem of our school and that generates both pride and controversy. I’m not Wharton but I don’t *discriminate* against Wharton students just because they’re in Wharton. I do get a bit pissed off by the institutional neglect sometimes experienced by non-Wharton kids though. 

I think it boils down to this— There’s some nastiness at Penn. I’m not going to sugar-coat it. All of us are going to interact with haters at least a few times.  It just so happens to be that Wharton kids or wannabe Wharton kids are an easy target for that hate, since they’re perceived to be part of something that gets more recognition. 

My advice is to avoid the people who bring others down and to surround yourself with kind, positive people at Penn. There’s a lot more of them than there are mean and nasty people. Some of the meanness has been ingrained into the culture at Penn and that’s not okay. We are one. We should lift each other up, not bring each other down. 

What’s important is that people like you are talking about this. We need to have these conversations to keep each other in check and make sure everyone feels valued at Penn.

Vandy has mandatory on campus housing four years so they’re expanding the freshmen dorms to include two more buildings and then approving more off campus living requests for upperclassmen and also looking into off campus vandy controlled buildings which was pretty vague.

Gap Year and Financial Aid Volatility,BrazilianPandemonium,"From [this page](https://ask.admissions.upenn.edu/hc/en-us/articles/360040924092-COVID-19-Updates-for-Admitted-Students) it seems that you would have to reapply for financial aid, and go through the process of getting the visa documents in February 2021.

It might also be worth considering if you will be able to attend Penn physically at all in the fall, given consulate/embassy closures and travel/entry bans currently in place.

Penn Admissions itself reminded international students (admitted through ED) a couple of months ago about the possibility of taking a gap year [(link here)](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/coronavirus-international-students-penn), so I would assume they would be accommodating

Most likely is that people won’t really know what’s going on — the administration is like that even when there’s not a global pandemic ;) Remember to ask follow-up questions.

Penn’s Decision re: Fall Abroad,chbmbb,"Imo, Penn is delaying decisions as the admin is still waiting for an okay sign to re-open campus whether that be a successful reopening of schools in other countries or the whole Ivy League coming together to push for re-opening campus.

Having another sem online increases the chance for more students going on leave or taking a gap year, which is not what Penn wants because they need to get money from tuition, dorm fees, and dining fees. 

I am sure that Penn admin knows deep down that re-opening campus for Fall 2020 is unlikely and quite counterproductive. Here are all the reasons why:

1. There are members in the Penn community who are more susceptible to the virus and are at high-risk if a mass infection happens on campus. If old or immunocompromised members of the community get sick from Penn’s re-opening, Penn could be facing a costly lawsuit.

2. Penn has international students. Currently, there are travel bans/advisories to or from the US to several countries and people are required to isolate and quarantine for 14 days upon arrival to foreign countries. This means that there needs to be enough space for international students to quarantine in solitude for 14 days, which is something that Penn cannot provide. International students can’t immediately go into their leased apartments/houses or dorms upon arrival to Philly, so where do they stay for 14 days? Inn at Penn? I don’t think so.

3. Pres. Gutman’s email from earlier mentions that even if the campus re-opens, big classes will still be online. I really don’t see how that is any better than just taking classes online remotely. Office hours will most likely still be limited so that’s not a good enough argument to vouch for having online classes on-campus. And even for seminar classes, we all know that having people face each other in poorly ventilated rooms talking to one another is a welcoming ground for the virus to spread. 


The pros really don’t outweigh the cons for Penn to re-open campus. Clubs will most likely still not be able to meet, dorms will be deadly as social distancing measures cannot be kept properly, and classes will be no more effective by having students listen to online lectures on-campus. To me, it just seems like Penn is waiting it out to see if magically a vaccine will be developed (which will not happen by fall) so that it can invite students back to campus and have us pay dorm fees and dining fees.",0,,False,framgjm,False,False,1590022014.0,2020-05-20 19:46:54

Best Dining Halls at Penn,suburbanoutfitters,"Tier 1: KCECH, Hillel, and Lauder

KCECH – kind and caring staff, usually not crowded during breakfast and lunch (never too crowded during dinner, either). 3 words: Fried Chicken Friday! Veggie options and smoothie bar are also amazing. The hidden gem of Penn dining... but not for long after this review.

Hillel – sure, an extra few dining dollars, but not too crowded either and the food is fresh. Great for if you are dairy free or vegetarian as they switch between menus to keep it kosher. There's also hummus and great desserts, and a few times a year the free Shabbat is not to be missed. If you have dietary restrictions, check them out because the staff members tend to be more knowledgeable about what ingredients are in the food!

Lauder – doesn't have as many options, but where else can you get plated gourmet dining hall food? I also enjoy the smaller vibe since it feels more like a cafe than a messy, crazy dining hall.

&#x200B;

Tier 2

Hill – more variety than at the previous tier and some food is made to order. Can get old pretty quickly, but it has something for anyone. Some super nice staff members, but some super rude ones too.

&#x200B;

Tier 3

Commons – a lot of food and that's pretty much it... always read the menu to find our what's for signature and expo before you go, unless your favorite foods are burgers and cereal. Cleanliness is also a little suspicious here. A few pluses are its large salad bar and yogurt bar.

&#x200B;

Best dining plan is no dining plan. Dining dollars = US dollars with limitations on where you can use them. Honestly, Dining dollars are a complete scam.

I also went home a decent amount and probably would’ve used more swipes (didn’t come close to running out either sem) if I hadn’t been home some weekends.

Also: make sure u check out NCH! check the menu ahead of time and definitely give it a try when they have something you like.

Why do most Quakers recommend taking the BFF dining plan (most dining dollars/least swipes)?,TauntyBird,"I still ended up with some leftover swipes and dining dollars, actually. I was originally planning on exchanging up to 30 of my left over swipes each semester (each swipe -> about $4 dining dollars, a ripoff but then again the whole dining plan is a ripoff since I wouldn’t have used those swipes anyways) but Penn only lets you do the swipe conversion in the fall semester. They only let you do the swipe conversion in the spring if you buy a dining plan for the next school year 🙄 So in hindsight I could have gone with the least swipes plan and probably would have been fine; I even had a lot of dining dollars left over second semester. I just got the middle plan to be “safe”, and it worked because I never needed to go out and buy food (if I did it was because I was really tired of dining hall food).

I think it also depends on your schedule. Fall semester I did have time to eat 2 meals a day in dining halls so that’s what I mostly did and used up most of my swipes with a few left over. Spring semester I had to eat brunch elsewhere on campus at least 3 days a week because of how my schedule worked out, so I had more swipes left over than expected. And that’s when I started using more dining dollars.

FYI: swipes dont carry over from fall to spring, but dining dollars do, and both dont carry over after freshman year. You can try out a dining plan for the first 3 weeks of fall semester and switch if you think it’s not right for you. And if I recall correctly you also have another opportunity to switch your dining plan right before spring semester again.",1,,False,epu0hcu,False,False,1559501308.0,2019-06-02 13:48:28

Best Place to Eat Around Penn,SKRules,"If you're want to go a step up from food trucks, I'll give you my low-down on West Philly.

Honest Tom's on 44th between Locust and Spruce has the best tacos and burritos hands down. If you're craving a bit more of a 'fine dining' experience, Mad Mex on Walnut between 34th and 36th is pretty good Americanized Mexican Food, and 2-4pm on Weekdays most of their menu is half-off. Awesome if you and your friends get tired of food trucks every day and have a late break in your schedule some day.

Pattaya at 40th and Chestnut is great, but a bit pricey to just go by yourself. A great place for the occasional dinner with friends though. Get chicken pad thai and laugh because at least 75% of their customers do the same thing.

If you want your dinner with friends to get a bit more fun, Tampopo at 44th between Locust and Spruce is probably the best place for a BYO if you want to stay in West Philly. It's probably also the best not-too-expensive East Asian restaurant that I've been to in University City.

Koreana behind 38th and Chestnut is pretty good, but I've heard some less-than-appetizing things about their cleanliness.

On the subcontinent, Sitar India at 38th and Chestnut is my favorite. For the buffet, at least - I don't think I've ever ordered anything at an Indian restaurant on campus. If you're cheap and asocial, they also let you do 'buffet take-out'. They give you a large take-out container and you can fill it up with as much food as you can fit and they don't even look at you funny. They also give you some tin foil to take bread with. I think they recently raised the price, but it's still <$10 for what's easily two+ meals worth of delicious Indian food.

For some low-grade Americana, I'm partial to Abner's at 38th and Chestnut - though I might be biased because I lived in Sansom. Still I think they have tasty pizzas, strombolis, and such. Better than Axis or Allegro, certainly. Don't go to Pizza Rustica - the owner is a terrible person, and the service sucks.

**Best overall**

I think it would have to go to either White Dog or Han Dynasty. Given that I generally have to be in the mood for spicy food for Han, I'd give it to White Dog. Almost everything on their menu is worth ordering. I'm sad that their happy hour isn't what it used to be. Their tartare was 5 bucks on happy hour until this year. At 10 or so on happy hour, still worth it. Delicious.

**Best value**

* Mad Mex happy hour, half off wings and beer, late night is half off most menu items and $7 big azz margaritas.
* Hummus - giant food that's fast and well-prepared. Some of the best falafel in the city in my opinion.
* New Delhi lunch buffet - $12 bucks gets you all the Indian you can eat.
* Koreana - cheap, solid Korean in a part of the city where there is very little representation. Squid noodles and their dol sot pork are my favorites. They also have bubble tea.

**Slightly off campus, worth going to:**

* Saad's Halal on 45th and Walnut. Some of the best Halal I've had in the city. Doesn't seem cheap when you look at menu prices but everything you get - even the sandwiches, can easily feed two normal people. Cash only.
* Vic Sushi between 20th and 21st on Sansom. Great BYO, crazy specialty rolls, very cheap solid quality sushi. Very small place and no reservations, so plan on small parties and waiting a bit Thurs-Sat evening.

I put it as one of my last choices and got in as a frosh but I have never left. It is absolutely one of the best dorm communities, and has a high retention rate. As opposed to the Quad, where you make friends with people in your hall because you guys are close to each other, Gregory people become friends because we see each other at events. Every week, we have AT LEAST 3 food events (study breaks and brunch) and 4 films showing. We have Eco Rep food events and raffles. There are DVDs you can check out and Kinect dance games to play. Trips include paintballing, skiing, visiting restaurants, Six Flags, movie screenings, apple picking, etc. Frosh live on the 3rd and 4th floor, and every month there is a birthday celebration event (cookie decorating, pumpkin carving, etc). If you make it to even a few of these events, you're going to meet people.

Now, the dorms themselves. Gregory has 2 buildings, Van Pelt and Class of 25. As a frosh, you'll be in a 4 bedroom quad with bathroom. There are also 2 bedroom doubles with bathrooms. You get your own room, but also have roommates! The furniture is pretty old, but Class of 1925 is due for renovation this summer (flooring, bathrooms) so you should apply there if you care about furnishings. Van Pelt is a larger dorm though, and the film screenings happen there. It's due for renovation next summer.

The cons of living here include the distance from class and the furnishings. If you aren't into partying or drinking a lot, Gregory is great because the majority of Gregorians don't seem to party. If you do like partying, there are a bunch of frats on this side of campus (and pretty much most restaurants).",3,,False,c8hzjyg,False,False,1361304456.0,2013-02-19 14:07:36

If you're someone who is afraid you might be scared to socialize a little bit, then the quad would be perfect for facilitating meeting new people. I will urge you against having a roommate.

1) It puts you in a group of students with similar interests (and is not any work, just additional events for fun).
2) The important one- it puts you in exactly the hall that you want to be in. For example, Goldberg Media and Communications was in McKean/Baldwin in Fisher Hassenfeld my freshman year. It was an awesome place to live (nice rooms, good community), and I was guaranteed a spot in the quad. Plus, it was a good program to be in. If you have a place you really want to live, find a RP that lives there and join it.

Also, Penn Preview days are key. You'll take a tour of the houses you are considering, and you'll be able to see inside a room, which we don't offer on tours (since they're so different even within the building). Check out maybe one or two of the quad houses, but definitely take a look at some of the other ones to make sure that they aren't what you really want.

I hear the Quad is nice, but if you like privacy or tend to be more introverted, try to get into a high rise. They have the nicest dorms, plus they're air conditioned so they are by far the most comfortable. But again, I didn't have that much of a typical ""freshman"" experience, but I didn't care.

Other notes:

Hill has tiny rooms and no AC.  Avoid.

Stouffer College House is actually 2 separate buildings - Stouffer Stouffer and Mayer Hall.

Stouffer is ~90% singles, ~50% freshmen.
Mayer is mostly upperclassmen, freshmen get triples (but have private bathrooms/kitchen) and all end up on the same floor.

It's a good way to isolate yourself in a room that may seem nicer than the quad at first glance, but is really just as small and cramped, without the character. 

Now, somebody who did FreshEx may be a better person to talk about it, but I have friends on the UA (student government) who have been discussing ditching the program since it gives students a bad impression of what the freshman experience really is.

The benefits of the high rises:
-Kitchen
-Nice Views (most of the time)
-Mostly singles, with multiple bedrooms (but some are still multiple people/bedroom)
-Closer to off-campus life
-Private Bathroom
-Can more easily live in the high rises in other years

Some of these seem really great. But here's why the high rises really are more for sophomores...
1) Kitchen- seems great. But you have a required dining plan that will be more than enough food for you. You probably won't really save any money by having a kitchen. 
2) Nice Views- Okay, some of them have really awesome views. That's great and all, but is it worth losing out on some of the other benefits of other houses (dining hall in Hill/KCECH/quad, views/community of the quad, etc.)
3) Mostly singles- The quad can give you a single very easily, all you have to do is ask. I had a single, it was great. But having a roommate can be good too. Having the high rise setup where you have a single, but multiple bedrooms is a great setup though.
4) Closer to off-campus life- cool, you have to walk a few blocks less to a party and back at night. You also have to walk a few blocks more every day to classes. The walk isn't really that significant of a difference though, a block or two overall doesn't matter too much at all.
5) Private Bathroom- Can be nice, but you have to clean it. I really did not mind the communal quad bathrooms at all- they're all 1 or 2 stalls and 1 or 2 showers, maybe 3 in the bigger ones. Mine was a 1 stall 1 bathroom shared with 3 people, so it was really just as private as a quad one- but we didn't clean it.
6) Can more easily live in the high rises in other years- This is actually a really good benefit. A lot of people try to get into the high rises as a sophomore and don't get it. It's really nice having the option to stay there. However, a lot of people want to live off campus with friends- especially if you join greek life and want to live in the housee. But, having the option is a pretty good benefit.


As far as the program itself, I have no idea what it actually does. If it's anything like other residential programs, it doesn't really do much. So it's not like it wil run your life, nor will it give you too much to do.

Tips for CIS120,johnathanjones1998,I don’t think I took notes for cis 120 since the lectures were very comprehensive and had an accompanying textbook specifically for penn. The only advice I would offer (and this is true for any cis class) is get started on homeworks early. Idk if you are a freshman or not but just start getting in the habit of doing that. It’s so much less stressful to work on an assignment over a week rather than the last 2 or 3 days.,8,,False,g1gqvxc,False,False,1597427282.0,2020-08-14 12:48:02
Tips for CIS120,cornflowerblue7,"IMO one of the most important things is starting early on the homework assignments and spreading out the work over the time you’re given. You might still get by if you procrastinate at the beginning, but content will get harder and you’ll end up in a bad place if you keep that up. 

Definitely utilize office hours if you need to (although sometimes there will be a long line of people). It also helps to find other people in the class you can talk to. 

As for handwritten or typed notes, I think it’s just up to you. I personally took notes by hand because I felt like it was a bit easier to annotate things and draw diagrams.

Everyone sign this petition for pass fail classes first semester!!,razburries,"Lmao don’t worry, your comment is not rude; it’s funny. Whats “dangerous” about this? He posted his name on the internet for people to see. His suggestion makes no sense and is insensitive because the whole point of extending P/F for this semester would be to give students the CHOICE to decide whether P/F would be appropriate for them based on their SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. Some students are staying home, some are on campus. Some may not be able to make a choice based on family or financial issues and this petition rightfully wants the university to sympathize with that. Everyone is faced with a different situation and optional P/F is supposed to grant students flexibility. If you are in a bad living situation and you RANDOMLY had to take your classes for a grade, wouldn’t you think that’s unfair especially when that means that people who are in stable studying environments are also RANDOMLY selected to take them for a grade and do better than you AND students who are also in a bad learning environment RANDOMLY lucked out and got the PF option? 

If he wants to take classes P/F, then the opt in/out P/F option from last semester works just fine for him. He can pick what he wants to P/F. Expecting that this works for everyone else is insensitive as there are many students who are struggling financially, emotionally, and mentally during this time and giving them the option to decide what is best for this is appropriate rather than screwing them over due to chance.

Everyone sign this petition for pass fail classes first semester!!,razburries,"I understand. I’m assuming you are a high school student (please let me know if this is wrong) but I’ll explain how people view Penn during this time. 

Yes, of course being accepted to Penn is a wonderful opportunity that I am forever grateful for it. I worked very hard to get into this school, and I know that luck was also a factor in me getting here. However after you get into the school, you have earned your spot there and it is now the university’s responsibility to provide you with the best experience possible. Just like any other school, public or private, prestigious or low ranking, we pay tuition to trust the school we attend with our education and student life for 4 years. Penn is just as responsible to treat students fairly as any other school. 

Once a student at Penn, you realize that Penn is not a school you put on a pedestal because there are flaws in its administration and student life. It is not perfect. It does not deserve all of the praise it receives in the public eye once you learn that it is a greedy institution with a president that makes $4M a year and refuses to pay PILOTS to make up for all the untaxed land it owns in Philadelphia. The wide range of demographics in the student body favors certain groups over others and there are a few bad seeds thrown in there. Penn is great, I do love this school, but it’s not perfect. I’m sure I would love any other school I could go to also, but no school is perfect. 

Regardless of how much one pays to go to Penn, we are still trusting the university with our education, a huge part of our life. Obviously, most people wouldn’t have many complaints besides high tuition or menial issues during normal times, but Penn honestly hasn’t done the best job possible to show care for its students during this pandemic, and that’s why a lot of people are upset. Many students have been displaced to poor environments that are not suitable for learning, and because they chose to trust Penn with their education, Penn is responsible for sympathizing with their struggles and trying to make the best experience possible out of a disaster. Remember that there are very very wealthy people at Penn and very very poor people at Penn. When we were sent home in the Spring, Penn created optional pass fail policy to accommodate the disparities caused by the drastic change. We all come from different backgrounds and admissions is not an even playing field. 

This is synonymous with other efforts the university makes during normal times to even the playing field of all students who come from different backgrounds including providing communities for FGLI and international students, CAPS for those struggling with mental health problems, and free tutoring services. During normal times, the administration makes its best effort to give every student at Penn the same opportunity for success, and being such a great institution, we should expect the same from them during a time like this.",5,,False,g0rb6ib,False,False,1596860147.0,2020-08-07 23:15:47

I think it boils down to the amount Penn gives you. I know that for my PennGrant is covers a huge portion of my fees and I can get a grant increase to cover insurance. If I were to stay at home, then this grant would be significantly lowered and most of my indirect costs, etc might not be covered. I receive a generous refund and will expect one in the fall for dining, so that helps cover those indirect costs etc.

What are some of the pros and cons of returning in the fall?,johnathanjones1998,"So, I think from your post you're more or less answering the question (given that you mention being at home is suffocating). Regardless of what decision you make, you need to be comfortable with the fact that all your classes may be online or basically have minimal in person sessions (and even if they do have those sessions, they'll be burdensome to say the least). You are the only one who can really weigh whether that's worth it over just staying at home. The primary factors to consider are a) productivity and b) social life.

For productivity, just track how you were doing in courses before and after Penn forced people off campus (and of course adjust for workload when making that calculation). eg for me, I actually found that it was really nice to work from home since I had minimal distractions, didn't have to walk anywhere to go to classes, and could easily record zoom sessions if I just wasn't able to pay attention + not really miss out on anything. Of course, this is just my experience and may not apply to you!

For social life, you'll need to talk to your current friends and ask whether they'd be coming to campus or not. Furthermore, you'd need to ask yourself whether you'd be fine with minimal parties/gatherings outside of a few people at most.

One last thing: no one knows whether there will be a second wave or not. If there is, it is more likely than not that Penn will not hesitate to kick people off campus again. You need to make a judgment and see if you're willing to put up with that or not.",3,,False,fw760o4,False,False,1593289037.0,2020-06-27 15:17:17

DP Columnist Breaks Down the Cost of Each Sorority,FightingQuaker17,"> In November last year, the former Vice President of Finance of Delta Delta Delta sent an email to members of the sorority who had not paid their dues, stating that their names would be announced at the beginning of chapter each Sunday unless they took care of their outstanding balances. This is in accordance with Tri-Delt’s national policy, former Tri-Delt Social Chair and College sophomore Kabele Cook said. Cook mentioned that Tri-Delt is working on a new accountability plan. McVay noted that she was unaware of this practice, and policies regarding dues vary from chapter to chapter. 

>Still, this method of socio-economic shaming speaks to the financial exclusivity of Panhellenic sororities.  

This was her strongest point IMO. My wife (then girlfriend) was on the board of a sorority when we were dating, and some of the things I learned about the inner workings of recruitment were especially atrocious. At the same time, her sorority experience was definitely worth the dues she paid into it (from working as a research assistant)  on both a social and professional level.

In general, if you have access to a wired connection, use that. APN is a good supplemental connection but it can't work to the point of everyone at Penn being on it, which is how everyone seems to think of it.

Basically, if everyone used APN when they actually needed it versus all the time, your issues wouldn't exist. C'est la vie, I guess.

ELI5--The SAC moratorium,SKRules,"This is a pretty tall order, but I'll attempt to tackle it. First we need some background on SAC.

Unlike many schools, student group funding at Penn is done by a branch of student government called Student Activities Council.  They get over a million dollars a year.  Getting ""registered"" as a group at Penn (through the G.O. Penn system) is trivially easy, but that doesn't really get you anything.  In order to receive any support from Penn (in the form of money, access to help at the Office of Student Affairs, certain special privileges, etc.), a group has to be ""SAC-recognized"".  This is often *non*-trivial.  Normally, SAC requires groups to have been around at least a year, have a constitution, decent membership, formal leadership composed of ~6 people, etc.). I think some of their requirements are bit too stringent, and it certainly doesn't make starting a successful group any *easier*, but while it's a bit of a hassle it's normally not too bad.

Now, who decides what sort of policies, monetary distribution and budgetary decisions SAC has? Most things are voted upon by the SAC General Body, which is composed of representatives from each SAC-recognized group, and a lot of the behind the scenes stuff is done by SAC Executive Board, which is elected from within the SAC general body.

On to the moratorium.

Nearly two years ago, SAC let a bunch of their student groups get into a fairly serious amount of debt. This is because they let groups spend on credit to pay for events, and then pay back that debt with ticket revenues.  I don't think the exact details are known, but this process went bad and a bunch of groups got into a lot of debt.  Something needed to be done.

Now remember, the people who were deciding how to handle this crisis were the SAC general body and exec, all of whom hold leadership roles in SAC-recognized groups who already get funding.  So the solution they came up with was the famed 'moratorium'.  They decided not to kick out any of the student groups who had overspent and not repaid, nor to impose heavy budget cuts on those groups.  Instead, they decided to stop recognizing any *new* groups, which prevents their outflows from growing from that source.

Recently there's been a movement on campus criticizing SAC on a few grounds.  The first is the moratorium in general - the thought is that this solution is unfair to students who are not part of well-established groups, and a better solution would be to impose cuts across the board.  The second complaint is that SAC is very secretive - they don't disclose details of meetings, executive decisions, policies, etc.  The third is a more general complaint on the setup of SAC being prone to these sorts of problems, which suggests that a better solution is necessary.

That's most of it right there. SAC leadership has been very vocal recently about their rising facilities costs - what they must pay Penn to use Penn spaces - and have cited this as a reason for the moratorium.  While this *is* a problem, it's separate than what solution is undergone as a result of budget crisis problems, whether they be caused by group debt or rising fees or what have you.

For full disclosure, I should 'out myself' and mention that I wrote [this opinion piece](http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/10/mismanagement-101) last week, so I am a bit biased.

I’m leaving Florida, and I stop by Publix for a snack

I’m leaving New Jersey and stopping by Wawa.

The chances that I come into contact with someone who is a carrier at Publix/Wawa are much higher from Florida than New Jersey.

Why is it more expensive to stay home?,Physical-Mood,"I'm not sure if I perfectly understand it but I'll give it a shot. 

There is a difference between your expected cost or EFC and the actual billed costs on Penn Pay. So for example, there is about $1000 for books included in your financial aid award. You are not actually charged for that obviously. I would say to imagine your FA award as if you cannot afford to pay anything to go to Penn: to make sure you don't have to pay a single dollar, they have to include all related costs like books and travel in your total cost. But you are not actually charged for them; they are just related costs to going to college. 

So, for people who have high amounts of grants and financial aid, the grants end up covering most or all of your billed costs. Then your EFC includes some of the related costs, which don't actually end up being things you have to buy. I spent nowhere near $1000 on books. 

The idea is that let's say my EFC is 10k. My FA covers everything except for 5k of actual charges like housing/dining/tuition, which I am then billed on Penn Pay. But because of the way they calculate the total cost of going to Penn, they expect that I'll pay various different sources (bookstore, airline, etc) another 5k when all is said and done with the semester. Therefore, they think I'll spend 10k total. Whether you actually spend another 5k in those related costs, who knows, but that's what Penn has to do in calculating all costs relating to coming to Penn.

So, when you stay home, your grant amount is reduced because your total cost goes down. But because your total cost goes down while your EFC stays the same, more of what you have to pay becomes actual billed costs. Therefore you end up having to pay Penn more.",12,,False,fzworf6,False,False,1596226611.0,2020-07-31 15:16:51

What are the best work study jobs as a freshman?,PizzaPenn,"There's no inherent difference between workstudy and non-workstudy jobs.  It's just a matter of where the funding comes from. A lot of departments prefer to hire work study students because it saves the department money, since half of the student's salary comes from the federal government. 

Penn is encouraging remote work whenever possible. I've heard about no absolute restrictions on on-site work, tho. 

""Best"" jobs is pretty subjective. It depends on what you want to do. Do you want a job where you get experience working with a professor and learning to do research? Do you want a job where you get to interact with lots of other people? Do you want to move around? Or Do you want a job where you sit on your ass and do nothing and have lots of time to do your homework?  Do you prefer to work with your hands or your brain?  Are you more interested in the sciences? arts? humanities?  All of these options exist.

What are the best work study jobs as a freshman?,pyre_teh_god,"My recommendation is to work at a library, although Van Pelt is more work than the other libraries (Fine Arts, Biomedical, Anthropology etc). The flipside of this is that the libraries will often only hire work-study students, so you have to be a little lucky to get the library job, if you're not work-study. There is a lot of work opportunity within these libraries. Some of this work (esp at Van Pelt) is actually fairly difficult, such as processing dissertations etc. You want to work at desk or shelving, although there are some other easy jobs within the library too.

Many freshman dorms have work in them, such as working at the Mirage/Oasis in English House or the 'Grotto' in Riepe. I'm not sure if these jobs will be available next year, given the Covid situation, but these are easy ways to earn money. You do lose these jobs after your freshman year however, so they don't carry over like some other employments.

Finally, the nicest job on campus is working at the Kelly Writers House. You just have to be on site, and responsibilities are limited. Because working at KWH is often just a hang-out, it can be pretty clique-y.

However, M&T is much more structured and gives you both a traditional engineering education and a traditional finance education (and not exploring their intersection as much). Does that make sense?

You can also apply to NETS and try and apply to M&T although that process is much more difficult than applying to NETS. As for job recruiters, it’s been my experience that there is almost no difference between CIS and NETS for success in acquiring internships. If anything, NETS might be better in terms of helping you build relationships with other students or professors who can help you and or refer you (because there are way fewer NETS students). Plenty of NETS kids work at big tech companies or fintech but that’s also the case in CIS — it really is what you make of it, your major doesn’t really impact your chances too significantly. Everyone pretty much takes the same courses and your performance in class, extracurriculars, and interviews is really what will make the difference.

If you just want to work in finance and take a more analytic role, then you should pursue a degree in Wharton where they will teach you the ins and outs of finance but skate by a lot of the math and technology that plays a huge role in finance (especially at hedge funds, less so at big banks).

Susan Meyer is the undergrad chair for the department and she is such a gem. She’s always available and really has your back. She’s also very flexible with fulfilling requirements. 

The teachers are all some of the best I’ve had at penn, and are very accessible and good at explaining abstract topics in an understandable way. The TAs though, are the best part I’ve found. Most philosophy classes have a recitation (usually on Friday, sorry) and they’re amazing! I’m currently in a review session led by my philosophy TA who’s leading his SECOND 4 hour Q&A session for our exam so he can make sure all the students had opportunities to ask all their questions.

How is the Philosophy Department Here?,pyre_teh_god,"One thing about the philosophy department here is that, like almost all the rest of the country, it's highly analytic. This is great if that's your preference. However it's fairly difficult to study continental thinkers like Heidegger, Adorno, Deleuze, etc, at Penn and most stateside colleges. There's one continental course offered a year in the department, and it's going to be a survey class for a while now I believe. Other than that, often times your only opportunity is courses in English or Comp Lit.

I'm sure you have some specific predefined philosophical interests. Depending how specific they are, the best advice I can give you is to watch what other subjects are offering. Comp Lit, English, History, and the languages will sometimes have classes on subjects that the Philosophy department does not.

"Anyone have experience with Penn Law submatriculation program, MA/JD?",movingforward91,"For submatric? What did the program/law school/grad school say when you asked them? If you aren't sure who to ask, I can try to point you in some direction. I would imagine there being lots of institutional support staff sitting around being paid to help you answer questions like these.

I'm at the law school by the way (2L). Also congrats on getting into Penn undergrad. You should be very proud. I think Penn Law student life is a hyper-politicized and immature shit show, but going through it is the only way to reach the other side.

As for getting into a top law school, I don't know how much internships matter, but getting over a 169 and keeping a GPA over 3.3 should do almost all of the work of getting you into a T13. Pay some consulting schmuck a couple grand to polish off any typos or awkward sentences in your application if you can swing it. I went into credit card debt for this, as a low-income applicant without any savings, and I still think it was (barely) worth it.",3,,1588095937.0,fov4in3,False,False,1588095253.0,2020-04-28 12:34:13

"Anyone have experience with Penn Law submatriculation program, MA/JD?",movingforward91,"It's T13 now, because UT Austin and Georgetown take a cliff dive in employment numbers, as well as they fail to meet the definition of T14 (i.e., they fail to have never fallen out of the T14).

I'm not sure what you mean by ""safe."" Depends what you think is safe. That's entirely subjective. For me, someone is safe for the T13 if they have over a 169, have over a 3.3, and submit an application that has had any typos or awkward sentences polished out.

Just because the median GPA for an incoming class is 3.8+ and LSAT 170+ does not mean that a ""typical matriculant has a 3.8+ and 170+."" That's not how statistics works. The aggregate cannot be applied to the singular. Further, medians are not ""averages."" That means we do not know what the typical applicant looks like.

If you submit a polished application and have a 3.8 and 170, you'll be expecting either a T6, or a T13 with scholarship, roughly speaking.

Most of these law schools admit like 20% of applicants, including Harvard. Don't underestimate that statistic. This is nothing like getting into an Ivy League undergrad (single digit percentage acceptance rates), with the exception of comparing Yale Law (10%) or Stanford Law (12%) to Darmouth undergrad (9%).",4,,1588254651.0,fp21zg1,False,False,1588253462.0,2020-04-30 08:31:02

Bombed the first chem 101 midterm with dr d. how do i fix this?,," When you talk to your professor, I always recommend owning up to what happened.  ""I didn't do as well on this exam as I had hoped.  I had another midterm and feel that I didn't study as much as I could have.  I am going to Weingarten and the Tutoring Center to work on time management and to get additional help with the material.""  

This shows that a) you're an adult who takes responsibility for your performance and b) you are proactively addressing the issue and you have a plan.  Professors love to help this kind of student.

""These are the concepts that I had the most difficulty with on the exam (or specific questions).""  

This shows that you're respecting their time (and yours) by coming in with specifics and not just throwing up your hands and going ""What do I do?  I don't know what happened.""  Come up with a list before you go in.  This list will also be useful when you go to the Tutoring Center.  What did you not understand?  What did you think you understood but didn't?  What did you not study that you're wondering if you should have focused on more (ex. definitions, formulas, rote memorization etc.)?  Put that on the list.

""Do you have any recommendations for additional resources I can use to better understand this material?""

Some professors have great additional material or advice for how to get the most out of their class.  It might be things that you've never done before or didn't work before - try it now/again.  Sometimes there's a study technique that didn't work in high school, but is great for undergraduate content.

Re: not studying enough because of your second midterm:  Get thee to Weingarten regarding time management.  If this is your first time having your own schedule, they can really help you nail down techniques and methods to come up with a viable schedule.  Because it's always going to be two midterms or finals or projects due on the same day.  One of the hardest transitions can be going from someone who can study for an exam in a short period of time and getting an A, to really needing a week or two to get there.

Tutoring is free at Penn: https://www.vpul.upenn.edu/tutoring/
If your house also provides it, you can check that out too.  The Tutoring Center is free.  GO NOW.  Because they can run out of tutors for 1:1 sessions if that's what you're looking for and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people are going post-midterm.  And if you don't get a tutor that works for you (great tutors and great students just might not be great for one another), ask for another.",2,,False,f23uzfr,False,False,1569938304.0,2019-10-01 08:58:24

Considering Penn: Need Help,moonlightstreetlamp,"I agree with the other commenters, but I also wanted to give some insight as a current biophysics major. I came in thinking that biophysics is just about studying muscle movement and neurons firing, but it is so much more than just that. That is to say, biophysics is really about all of physics and physical models applied to biological systems. I found biophysics to be a way of studying physics without the dryness of talking about particles or recording numbers from a machine. After taking Phys280, our undergraduate biophysics course, I realized how broad the field is. You can study enzyme action in cells using topology and statistical mechanics, you can model bacterial populations with simulations, you can use optics to understand advanced microscopy or eyes, and so on. The last example in particular is the subject of all of Phys280, taught by the absolutely amazing Phil Nelson. I definitely have not have had a more intellectually stimulating and engaging class than 280.

&#x200B;

On a more academic level, I would definitely recommend checking out the course requirements for the biophys major. You'll find that it is a mix between the physics and biochemistry majors, and you can easily double up on majors with just a few extra classes. You'll have Prof Nelson as an adviser, which is a really underrated plus. Doing the biophysics major would also fulfill pretty much all of the premed requirements, with the exception of maybe psychology and an English class, I think. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I don't mean to convince you otherwise if biophysics is not really what you want to study. This is just coming from my experience, previously thinking that biophysics was just looking at fish swim in a tank. I wouldn't worry too much about what particular major you have. Like another commenter said, you'll find a job regardless of what you graduate Penn with. It's definitely more important to find study what you find exciting. 

&#x200B;

In terms of departmental reputation, Hopkins physics might be a little better known than Penn physics.

I speak for Penn since that's what I know, but I'm sure it's similar in JHU. It is \*very\* easy to change your major or transfer schools within Penn. Had a friend who applied to do chemistry, ended up switching to fine arts. Another went from pre-med to econ. ​ 

Take some biophysics classses your first year. If you hate it, they'll still satisfy some of your requirements when you switch majors/schools. Also take neuroscience and engineering classes, to see if you like it. You can't transfer during your first year so use it to experiment. Many SEAS classes are open to SAS students. 

Also talk to your advisor. Email them beforehand so they know what to expect and can research it, then go see them. It'll be much easier if your advisor knows that you're hesitating and is there to support you.

Considering Penn: Need Help,moonlightstreetlamp,"Heh, if I'm not mistaken, that's from the Vagelos MLS website, since it sounds exactly like something our adviser Ponzy Lu would write.

I wouldn't worry too much about the curving at this stage. If you are passionate about physics and you like understanding phenomena on a fundamental level, I'm confident that you're grades will look fine. Also, your sources are a little suspect, since the intro physics classes curve to a median at a B (standard pretty much everywhere), and the upper level classes are more generous than that. The physics department tends to be very reasonable about grading and curves in general (the chem department, on the other hand...). 

Vagelos and premed are definitely possible, about half of MLS students go to get an MD or MD/PhD. Also, the GPA requirement for MLS is a 3.5, so you sort of have to do well to be in the program (the way I phrased it makes it sound intimidating, but don't worry about it so much at this stage). People frequently drop MLS because they think it will decrease their grades too much to get into medical school, but that is a concern to have in your sophomore year, particularly because the freshman year will get you through your physics, gen chem, and maybe some other med school requirements already. Additionally, MLS is pretty flexible, especially if you're a physics major (physical chemistry is just quantum taught by chemists without hard math, etc), so it is really a personalized discussion to have with the two advisers.

Edit: You can still have Phil as an adviser in MLS. Even if it's not officially, as long as you are a biophys major or if you even take his class (which you 100% absolutely should), he will be happy to help you out with everything.

Going off on what shiinzou said, there are engineering-only sections for some of the general engineering requirement classes (i.e. chemistry, math), but they are not necessary to fulfill engineering requirements. I am in chemical engineering, and I took the College version of general chemistry freshmen fall. Also, the engineering math section is a new thing, so you would not be at a disadvantage if you took the college version. 

Most of the engineering majors take similar classes in freshmen year, so if you are determined to major in engineering, but don't know which you want, it's pretty flexible during freshmen year (and even sophomore year, to an extent).",1,,False,ele1j5r,False,False,1555806179.0,2019-04-20 19:22:59

Considering Penn: Need Help,moonlightstreetlamp,"The chem department is somewhat notorious for curving low in the gen chem/organic chem classes. It is generally rumored that gen chem tends to be curved such that the median grade is at the boundary of C+/B-, and similar for some orgo sections. This can vary by professor, but these are generally loathed by premeds. However, premeds around the world hate organic chemistry, and the gen chem classes here are particularly tough (probably to weed some folks out). As an MLS student, you'll be encouraged to take the honors chemistry sections Chem114/115 and Chem116 instead of standard gen chem, especially if you have a strong background in chemistry. These classes are generally more interesting and prepare you for the sort of thinking that will benefit you in classes down the line (physical chemistry basically) because are based in derivations and laws. Most MLS freshmen take these. If you've taken AP/IB chem in high school, these honors chem sections are probably worth your time, if not for the fact that they curve much much more generously (median grade at B+/A-). 

&#x200B;

The fact that Dr Lu doesn't like premeds has turned into more of a myth nowadays. He has warmed up to the idea very much, given the inevitable percentage of premeds populating his program, and he might just make one or two judgemental comments but otherwise advise you the same as any of his other students. That is to say though, you should have an interest in research, or be prepared to do research for most of your time at Penn if you enter the program. If you don't give a rat's ass about research, the program might not be the place for you. Many students do in fact find this when they enter the program, hence the \~50% drop rate in the first semester (about 60 students to 30). 

&#x200B;

This is sort of up to my personal opinion from seeing my premed friends drop or stay in during their sophomore year, but I think that second year is the time to consider what MLS is doing to your GPA for a number of reasons. First, as Dr Lu says, freshman year is a reflection of how good your high school was, and the years after are a reflection of how smart you are (since many people have to adjust to college intensity/workload freshman year, but after that everyone is on a level playing field). This is honestly a pretty fair statement, and using your freshman year as an indicator for your performance for the rest of college might be misleading. Additionally, after freshman year in Vagelos, you will have taken two semesters of intro chemistry and physics. By this point you will know if you are a) good at these subjects, or at least able to work hard and get a grade that you are satisfied with, and b) if you actually enjoy these. You might notice from looking at the MLS curriculum that it is all physics and chemistry. This fact is unescapable, it is the basis of the program. Organic chemistry and physical chemistry, in fairness, are nothing like gen chem, so it's possible that you might hate gen chem but love these (or vice versa), but freshman year in MLS serves as a good barometer for how you feel about subjects in the coming years. Once you get into sophomore year, you have this information and you can choose how to proceed from there. There is also the logistical reason, which is that you need to have a 3.5 minimum by the end of sophomore year to stay in the program. This is the selection criterion for who gets to stay for the summer, and it is decided during sophomore year (Ponzy gives strict warnings and hovers over you if you are slightly below 3.5 before end of sophomore year, but this is the point where you'll actually get kicked out for it). 

&#x200B;

Freshman year of MLS is really where your course is not flexible and pretty much set in stone. The MLS curriculum pretty much covers the biochemistry major, so your major is already covered. If you're doing more majors, you can choose when to take those classes at your own discretion (which semester you take them is generally up to you). Likewise with submatriculating, you can choose to take your master's classes whenever you want. The curriculum is not very flexible, but you can notice that as you get into junior and senior year, there are hardly any classes on there, and you can take whatever you need for your majors. Core classes get thrown in there somewhere. If you need to do a language, they become a pain in the ass, but if you come to Penn being able to place out of a language, or at least start a few levels higher than the first, it will really help you out. In that sense I highly recommend taking the SAT IIs in your language of choice, if it's accepted by the department. You are right that the curriculum of MLS tends to be rigid, but there are some changes that you can make if you sweet talk Ponzy (take organic chemistry freshman year and skip intro chem altogether, replace Phys240/250 with another physics class if you're doing the phys major, replace physical chemistry with quantum physics).",1,,False,elngmlm,False,False,1556109451.0,2019-04-24 07:37:31

I'm a junior at a public high school in Georgia, who might be on the lower end of making it into UPenn. I want to know if I should attempt it or not.

Sophomore year all but one of my courses were honor courses, with one AP class (APUSH), which I got a 5 in on the final exam. My GPA was 4.1 and my class ranking was 35 out of 330. My extracurricular activities are currently: 

* Junior Classical League, which I am the treasuer of

* Garden Club, which I am the president of

* Mock Trial Team

* National Honor Society

* Environmental Club

* Model UN Team, which I am the Captain of. 

I also did varsity tennis for the last two years, but don't plan on pursuing that this year. I have been in the above clubs every year of high school with the exception of NHS (they only accept Juniors and above) and Environmental Club, which I joined recently. 

I am currently enrolled in the IB Diploma program, which essentially means that I am taking six AP classes, although they're called IB classes, and are arguably harder. The diploma should boost my GPA to around a 4.25, if I continue on the path I'm on now. As for my SAT scores, I am in the 92nd percentile, which isn't too great compared to many UPenn students. I am studying hard for the next SAT opportunity, where I hope to do a fair amount better. 

If UPenn is looking for a ""story,"" as I know many Ivy League types do-- then I can give them details about how I lived on a boat and sailed around the world from the age of 8 to 12. 

Looking at the above information, do you think I stand a chance at acceptance?
Thanks!

I've been set on UPenn since about halfway through my junior year. It was the first school I fell in love with and the one that convinced me that it was worth a try to attempt to go out of state for Uni. Prior to UPenn I had always kind of accepted that I could never afford to study outside of my local community college, and that my grades didn't exactly merit scholarships. (I didn't try much in high school the first 2 and a half years)

Ever since then though I've been working my ass off, I have been taking honors high school courses since middle school but now I'm doing more than just passing. I did dual enrollment at my local college and took credit courses every evening after school for a couple of semesters. (My college GPA is a 3.5)

I've taken
AP Psych 10th grade (4)
APUSH 11th grade (5)
AP Lang 11th grade (4)
AP European History 11th grade (3, which was a miracle because there was no teacher for 3/4ths of the year)

And I'm currently taking 
AP Macro
AP Gov
AP Art History
AP Literature
AP Human Geo 

I received a travel and tuition scholarship to attend a summer economics seminar my 9th grade and 10th grade summers. 

Then junior year summer I received a scholarship that covered tuition, room &amp;amp; board to a politics, philosophy, and economics seminar in Germany (Theodor-Heuss Akademie, an academy located in Gummersbach)

I'm president of my high school debate and MUN club and have won awards throughout all 4 years (it's the one thing I put a lot of effort in during those years I didn't care about grades)

I've been heavily involved in my high school's culinary arts programs all 4 years.

I specifically want to major in the PPE program at the College of Arts and Sciences and I'm extremely confident in the essay that I wrote for the writing supplement.

I scored a 31 in the ACT (which I am proud yet disappointed in, the score would've been higher if maths wasn't my ultimate weakness)

I took 4 different subject tests
Math Lvl 2 (score is embarrassingly low because I was super unprepared)
US History (700)
Literature (710)
Spanish writing (800)

I guess the main reason I'm posting here is because as under qualified as I feel, I am still extremely proud of all that I achieved once I actually began to apply myself. I had no motivation throughout most of my high school career, and I wish I could go back in time and slap the shit out of myself. Yet, I'm still proud of the fact that I at least managed to pick myself up these last few months. 

I hope that I receive that letter of early admission. But I am conscious of the fact that people more qualified than me have failed. Wish me luck :)

What does it mean when someone says they are a 'Wharton graduate'?,Ninjaboi333,"Hi, Wharton class of 2014 (undergrad since it's relevant) and a Filipino as well so this has been blowing up my Facebook feed as well.  This is *probably* a bit more than you need but I don't usually rant on Facebook so I'll just do it here. 

Penn is broken up into 12 schools - 4 that offer both undergraduate and graduate degrees, and 8 that offer graduate degrees only (the grad school only ones are the Vet school, Med school, Dental School, School of Social Policy, Graduate School of Education, Law School, Design school, and Annenberg School of Communication).  The 4 undergraduate schools are the College of Arts and Sciences, Nursing, Engineering and of course Wharton. 

When you apply to Penn you have to select which specific school you apply to. You cannot enter Penn without being part of one of the four schools.  I was lucky enough to enter Penn as part of the Wharton school.  My best friend/roommate started off in Engineering and later transferred internally to Wharton.  Penn also gives you the option to get multiple degrees from different schools while an undergrad - my roommate for example ended up with both a BS in Economics from Wharton and a BA in Math from the College of Arts and Sciences. 

For an ELI5 Example - think of Hogwarts. You cannot be part of Hogwarts without being sorted into one of the four houses.  If Wharton is Slytherin, then when Draco Malfoy graduates from Hogwarts, he also graduates from Slytherin. 

I guess to actually answering your question - it is not incorrect to say I am a Wharton grad if I only have a Bachelor of Science in Economics (which everyone gets and which I currently have).  Since we have ""graduated"" (ie completed all the courses and requirements to receive a diploma from the university) then we are considered graduates.  We are referred to as undergrads while we have not yet completed said requirements.  So while I was still spending long nights in Huntsman Hall, I was an undergraduate. Now I am a graduate. If I got back for my MBA I will be both a Wharton graduate and an MBA student. Once I complete my MBA I will be a Wharton graduate twice over - once for my undergrad and once for my MBA.

Going a bit deeper into the MBA question, we don't usually assume that the person has an MBA.  In general there are usually about 2500 undergrad students currently enrolled and about 1800 MBAs so odds are when you refer to someone as a Wharton grad they're more likely an undergrad than an MBA to be honest.  We usually refer to Wharton graduates who have an MBA degree as Wharton MBAs and Wharton graduates with an undergraduate as Wharton graduates. In fact, it is usually the case that if you graduated from Wharton, Wharton kids will specifically say that they graduated from Wharton rather than saying you graduated from Penn, in order to distinguish.  Bit of a elitism to be honest, but it comes with the territory. 

Fun fact - when I told my lolo/lola that I got into Penn they thought I got into Penn State until I clarified I got into Wharton.

What does it mean when someone says they are a 'Wharton graduate'?,pennmc,"I can corroborate that pennwharton18 is indeed correct (I'm a Wharton senior). Personally, if I were to split up my classes, I have taken only 1 year of non-business classes and will have taken 3 years of exclusively business classes (I have two concentrations, which is pretty common in Wharton).

The reason so few undergrads get an MBA is because (1) we already have Wharton degrees, and there's a huge opportunity cost to getting a grad degree and (2) the curriculum is extremely similar. In fact, undergrad classes are typically more competitive, and multiple professors have remarked to me that undergraduates in general perform better (though part of this is likely due to the fact that MBAs don't report grades).

Of course I can't speak from experience about the past, but it's my understanding that it's generally always been like this. Wharton has always been business-class heavy, and the curriculum is necessarily similar since many MBA's are taking the first business classes they've ever taken.

Prof's are different between undergrad and MBA classes. Undergrads typically aren't allowed to take MBA classes because they are so much easier (I'm not kidding).",2,,False,cy24i8s,False,False,1450353172.0,2015-12-17 05:52:52

Struggling to stay afloat as an engineering freshman,communityDOTsolar,"Everyone is going to have a different solution. Mine was to download/torrent/register for all the teacher manuals of the textbooks online, and then shrink sample test problems onto the allowed ""cheat sheet"", in hopes that the test questions would be similar. This was a good enough tactic to barely pass all my lower level classes. 

This was not the best way to manage things. It isolated me from study groups and I feel it stunted my academic advancement. Instead, I would encourage you to take full advantage of the TA system. Also, swallow any pride and ask to join a pre-existing study group of your peers. Treat your homework like a job, and you'll catch up.

Also, don't be afraid to fail a class. If you're like me (50% financial aid, 25% loan, 25% parental help), then you might dread the thought of having to take an extra semester to load you and your parents up with more debt , or be perceived by your peers as ""dumb"". That's all horseshit. Penn engineers have stellar career opportunities regardless of gpa or needing an extra semester or two to graduate.  Getting discouraged and dropping out is the worst thing you could do.

As an upper class man, I took advanced linear algebra for computers and found myself using those skills to complete homework assignments in many engineering courses which my peers struggled with. Eventually upper level design classes helped me drag my otherwise terrible gpa out of the gutter. It doesn't get easy, but it gets easier.

You could also find some money for a student tutor. Many professors often suck at teaching advanced math that comes naturally to them.

I remember getting a 1/10 on a calc III midterm and still getting a C on it because 15% of the class got 0/10. Just rest assured that knowing PowerPoint and being good at computers is more important for most actual engineering careers than fully understanding the level of advanced math you learn at Penn.",1,,False,cwfyhac,False,False,1446046353.0,2015-10-28 10:32:33

How does independent study work?,johnathanjones1998,"From the CIS side of things, you reach out to a professor and draft up a basic outline of what you're going to do. In seas, they actually have a committee that reviews each of the independent study proposals and approves it or sends it back asking you to come up with something else to study. You do your study, and then at the end of the semester, you produce a report and give it to your professor -> then just get a grade.

In biology, the process is similar, but a little bit more formal because a fair amount of people do independent study in their junior/senior year. The general outline is the same, but with more paperwork and a couple more deadlines to keep in mind. 

Overall, contact the department you are interested in doing independent study in and see what their policies around it actually are. I doubt that many would prevent you from actually taking it if you are not in the major (and if someone asks, you could always say you're interested in pursuing that major in the future and wanted to dip your toes into some research first).",4,,False,g1wxzrw,False,False,1597699925.0,2020-08-17 16:32:05

Note taking: iPad vs Notebooks,mandmthrowawayzz,"Yes! I recommend the latest Pros but Apple has a handful of options.

The other iPads (including the Mini) support the first gen Apple Pencil now so whatever is within your budget.

I think the regular iPad is specifically targeted at college students and cost as much as ""paper replacements"" like the Remarkable Tablet, except with more functionality relevant to school (e.g. taking notes on slides, writing papers, Zoom).

I personally got the pro for the USB C functionality (all my devices have it), the high refresh screen and because I liked the design more (I hate bezels).

But DONT FORGET to add a matte screen protector! It makes a huge difference. I hate the feeling of writing on smooth glass and the protector makes it feel like paper. Get any cheap brand with decent reviews on Amazon. Paperlike is overpriced and not worth it at all imo.

For note-taking apps, Goodnotes and Notability are great but honestly you can't go wrong with plain old OneNotes. Especially since we get it for free with our Penn emails anyway. And it works really well with both handwritten notes and typed out notes.

Finally, if you have a Mac and/or an iPhone it really is a no-brainer. Apple's seamless integration is unparalleled. And having something like an iPad can be useful especially with remote classes.

Note taking: iPad vs Notebooks,MajinOver9000,"Absolutely recommend iPads. After getting one, I never used notebooks ever again, nor did I use Google Docs or Word to take notes. If you get an iPad, get a note taking software such as Notability. You can type, dictate, write (using an Apple Pencil), etc. on the sheets in Notability, and when you finish, you can convert the files into PDF. It's also convenient because you can store and organize notes from all of your classes in different folders per class. My teachers allowed us to use a note taking software (when we transitioned online) so it was easy to write exams and then submit them as PDF directly. 

I second what the others said about considering higher storage. You're going to be taking a lot of notes, and that too for all classes on your iPad. That eats up space quite quickly. Since Penn gives free Box accounts to all students, you can use Notability to automatically back up your notes to Box or Dropbox (or whatever cloud storage service you use), and free up iPad space.

While I’m a huge fan of iPad and believe that iPad is far more convenient and enjoyable than traditional pen-and-paper, I would never call it a necessity, because it’s clearly that you can do all the works on paper just like how people did before. Also, I have to admit that, it’s really case-by-case and subjective. Because some people don’t like writing on the devices.

My suggestion is that, you may borrow the iPad and pencil from your friends to try for several days IRL. I did that before the final purchasing. 

The key is not your major, but your learning style and note-taking system. IMO, the iPad is very good as a platform for handwritten projects, including but not limited to your classnote, reading, and assignment. However, if you don’t write that much, I doubt it’s very useful. 

Notes that, for me, the iPad is solely for handwriting and I prefer do other works mainly on my Mac. However, some people use iPad do everything, PDF, novels, videos, games, GTD, notes, codes, latex, etc. Again, it’s very subjective.

has Penn ever requested government assistance before 2020?,johnathanjones1998,"So...it depends what you mean by government and what you mean by assistance.

PA state govt' actively funds the UPenn vet school, Philadelphia:[https://www.thedp.com/article/2017/10/penn-vet-will-receive-30-million-in-state-funding-after-all](https://www.thedp.com/article/2017/10/penn-vet-will-receive-30-million-in-state-funding-after-all)

I also imagine that Penn get's a fair amount of kickbacks from the Philadelphia city govt' because it is a major jobs provider in the area. But this is primarily done through policy that applies to everyone (but could have been originally made to benefit Penn/other large philly universities in some way).

On a federal ish type level, Penn receives a ton of funding via NIH (and similar fed research orgs) grants and that basically alleviates a lot of the research expenditures since a fair portion of labs are self-sustaining based on the amount of grant money they bring in from federal (and external) organizations. Pell grants and federal work study programs are also provided to Penn by the govt. Penn also spends a fair amount of $$ on lobbying for various political causes, so they are probably getting some degree of kickbacks as well through other policies. Also...by being recognized as a 501c3 nonprofit, they are exempt from federal taxes (which basically saves Penn on the order of billions a year).

&#x200B;

If you're asking something along the lines of what happened this year with the $9.9M CARES act fund, I'd honestly consider it along the lines of a grant similar to the NIH/Pell grant type stuff above (ie its federal). I don't think Penn actively requested that money ([well...at least harvard said they didn't request it](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/harvard-trump-coronavirus.html)) and was instead just allocated to us based on the provisions from the CARES act itself (I think like $14B was allocated to all higher ed institutions and was split based on amount of fed financial aid awarded to students in the institution). Of course, we returned it [due to some backlash](https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/04/cornavirus-aid-relief-cares-funding-penn-ivy-league) (but damn $9.9M would have been nice just to distribute to all students).

But the bottom line is that Penn receives a significant amount of aid from the governments (city, state, federal) it interacts with.",12,,1595748275.0,fza3kpk,False,False,1595746282.0,2020-07-26 01:51:22

Advice for a Non-Drinker at Penn,stringandshoelace,"I'm a current sophomore. I don't drink or smoke and I'm not a part of hook-up culture. As a freshman, you won't have it yet, but you'll slowly begin to gain some backbone. This is not meant to be patronizing; I'm truly being honest here. Freshman year is a tough time for adjustment and figuring out who you are. Since high school, I was lucky enough to be a good conversationalist. At Penn, I am one of the most social people I know and they are all pretty diverse- I have close friends that sleep around, I'm good friends with plugs, while at the same time I have friends who are celibate and friends who hate smoke. 

I live life without judging the decisions of others and, through that same facet, I expect my friends to not judge me. Never carry friends that don't allow you to be comfortable in your own skin. GO TO PARTIES, PLEASE HAVE FUN while keeping your grades up. But beware, parties and night-time pressure is real and even your own guidelines might bend. It helps to go with friends that don't drink either in order to abstain from any pressure and not feel all the way left out. If you choose to drink, that's perfectly fine too, but I suggest you make sure your first time is in the privacy of your dorm building with trusted friends so you familiarize yourself with how you are under the influence.

Spring Rush,dhenry2217,"Please please don’t make your decision based on financials. As somebody who came onto campus in the exact situation and ended up being president of a fraternity I can tell you for sure that money shouldn’t be an issue. 

Dues are negotiable in every organization and, in fact, living in a chapter house is astoundingly cheaper than any other on campus option. It is worth noting, though, that if you don’t live in the chapter house and you’re a member you get charged an out of house member fee.

My advice: go to open rush, get some free food, talk to some brothers - if they like you and you like them you’ll get a bid and you can talk over financials when you get there. If that time comes they’ll really want you to join and will be more than willing to make concessions.

Elixr has a new location on Market. Solid coffee, and they support our Penn Coffee Club, so even more of a reason to go there ;) (give me a DM if you want to join the club)

Ultimo's flash-iced coffee is excellent. Their best location is in Graduate Hospital, a short stroll or bike ride away. 

ReAnimator is pretty solid, but their customer service is ehh. Still worth giving it a shot. It's on 45th I think (contrary to popular opinion, it's plenty safe to go that far west). 

Avoid Saxby's. All I can say there. 

If you like dark rich coffee, give La Colombe a try. Same with Rival Bros. 

Square One is very tasty and is led by people who have excellent experience in the coffee industry. They also support Penn Coffee Club, so I especially encourage you to try them. 

I hear Joe Coffee is good. I have a bag of beans coming in this week but have yet to actually try them.

"ordering textbooks.. what is ""calculus lab 1 semester access"" and ""top hat access card""",moonlightstreetlamp,"That probably refers to an access code for MyMathLab and MyEconLab, which are online homework websites. You can probably buy those from the book store or direct from the website. They may also come with the textbooks, if you're ordering those.

As a note since it seems like you're an incoming freshman, consider waiting until getting here to order books or course materials. You may switch courses early in the semester, and some classes don't actually require the listed textbook. Of course the bookstore website says that every book is required because their job is to sell you brand new $200+ textbooks, but some professors don't really use it or they provide enough resources that having a textbook isn't really necessary. Also, tons of people sell used books online or at Penn for cheap (that calc textbook, for example, is sold for dirt cheap between Penn students because of the excess supply of them). If you want to buy new books and the excitement of college is getting to you now, go for it and buy away.

Do you mean is it looked down upon to do online interviews or in person?

If you can get an in-person interview, it's definitely preferred, but skype interviews work just fine and are necessary in places with a lot of applicants/few alumni or places with low population concentrations. I've done a couple of online interviews and they went very well--just make sure you and the interviewer are on the same page with what technology you will use.

If you are asking about the online program in general--I really don't know anything about it, but I wouldn't think people would look down upon it. A Penn Masters Degree is a Penn degree. The strength of the program will matter more to people than whether you took it online, I imagine.

1) For god's sake don't get into an intellectual debate with your interviewer. 9 times out of 10 you will come out looking like an asshole. Just speak your truth, be an advocate for yourself, and be prepared

2) I don't care too much for a reschedule or two. Things come up, that's fine. Don't give a shit how people dress as long as you don't stink. The OP is absolutely correct though, preparation is key. Going into an interview, I know nothing about you but your name and what high school you attend. When I ask you to tell me about yourself, consider that context (and don't tell me about your test scores, I don't care). Most of the people I interview are fantastic in many ways. For me, the ""Why Penn?"" question is huge. If your answer isn't specific and could apply to several different good schools, you're kind of screwed since 1 of the 4 questions that Penn asks us about interviewees is essentially how well you would fit in at Penn and how you would contribute to the community and in what ways. I can't advocate for you if your answer is too general. Asking questions is important too, but answering the 'Why Penn?' one well is much more important for me.

Important note, given the differences between what I am saying and what OP said: Your mileage will vary between interviewers--another reason why preparation is key.

"I'm a Penn alum who volunteers to conduct admissions interviews, AMA.",FightingQuaker17,"Useless information for an individual applicant and unhelpful when preparing for an interview. As you know, we don't know what the admissions' officers see, how they make their decision, and how much the interview comes into effect in individual decisions. What is available for applicants are interview guides from Penn and the specific instructions/advice given to all interviewers, which is publicly available online. Everything else is individual preference of the interviewer, which can only be so helpful since, as demonstrated in the thread above when you and I answered a persons question, interviewers disagree about what is most important. 

If you do have hunches, and that's all they really are, then it isn't ""inside info"" and just your opinion, which will differ from other interviewers, and shouldn't be a closely guarded secret in any case. 


EDIT: I was completely wrong to call that ""useless"" information. Personal experience can go a long way in giving good, applicable advice to prospective students. I would caution by saying that all interviewers are different and may have different preferences and ways of doing things, which is why it's important to prepare by looking at the interview guidelines.

It makes sense because everyone at Penn worked hard to get in there, but that means that you get a student body that's used to being at the top of their class.

But like one of my professors once said, half of the students have to be part of the bottom half (in rankings) and the other half will be at the top. For students that aren't used to being ""bottom half"" in academics, this can turn into a very stressful situation that they may not handle well. It also doesn't help that people who do well at Penn tend to be very vocal, whereas people who don't do too well tend to keep quiet about their struggles since there seems to be a stigma against failing at Penn.

How did you make friends at Penn?,Ohmyblast,"My hall didn't really have people that I could become friends with; they were all too cliquey. The three best friends/family I have made at UPenn were essentially founded on alcohol and the anime club. Legit used a girl for the ratio to get into a frat party and became the best friends ever that night. One of my hallmates also asked to go to the party with me that night, so he also became a best friend. My other best friend was met through anime club. The three of us always got food together and always hung out with eachother/studied with eachother/ played games with eachother. They have really become family to me.

And from having those three good friends, I also came to meet a bunch of other cool people that they knew through classes and what not. More people I constantly hung out with resulted from taking many smoke sessions at the BioPond. The drug culture, albeit not the best culture to get into, allowed me to meet many people, a lot of whom I have become great friends with. 

Basically you do not want to trap yourself in your room if you want to meet people. Academics are extremely important, so make sure you are not engaging in activities that detract from that too much such as partying and doing drugs, but also be open minded about ways to meet people. Classes are a good way to start meeting people along with joining clubs and doing work study as others have noted. Aside from that, you meet a lot of people basically by pearlgrowing; you have one friend who hangs out with another friend who you meet. And then you guys become friends. And they can introduce you to other friends, and the cycle continues. The key, however, is not to spread yourself thin and become friends with everyone, but rather to find a good group of friends who you become very close with. All the other people you meet will be friends that you can hang out with, but they probably won't be as close with you as your main group of friends.

How did you make friends at Penn?,adustydreamer,"Thanks for sharing this. That's what I really feel that I'm missing in my social life here - a ""family.""

We typically hang out around some other obligation or occasionally make a plan to do something/eat, but for the most part our encounters are pretty sporadic. And none of them know eachother so we don't all hang out together.

A part of me thinks it's too late for me to really address this - it's my last year here and it seems that all these ""groups"" are already formed and hard to penetrate or not a good match for me. But things do seem more promising for me then they have in past years and I think I'm more willing to put in effort and talk to people I don't know at events/class etc.

Cause you don't want to go up to a group and try to start a conversation out of fear the people will be like ""Who the hell is this guy?"" but I guess you do just have to kind of force yourself to do that. There are many great,kind people to meet, but it's up to you to search for them. If I wasn't on medical leave this year I would definitely be down to meet up with you and hang out and introduce you to people, but sadly I won't return until next year when you're gone :/ But with that being said, when you do hang out with some of your friends that you see sporadically, try and find a way to get them to show you their other friends. Family really develops when you constantly hang out with people and get to know eachother on an intimate level. Without that intimacy, you're really kind of just ""friends"".

a few more i cant remember right now

Standardized test scores: (this is where i do not feel super confident)

Old SAT: 2160
New SAT: 1430

Not yet received, but I think on SAT math II, chem, and literature i will receive at least a 760+, hopefully an 800


1. to any current students in any of the dual degree/ joint degree programs listed or any student enrolled in penn at any school, what were your stats compared to mine/ how do you feel about the decision of enrolling in penn?

2. even though my father never donated or stayed in touch with penn, will the legacy still help me in the application process? 

3. i know that it seems like my extracurriculars are all over the place, but it truly is bc i enjoy participating in every one of them. they arent college app fillers, but i do really have a broad range of interests and liked to pursue them throughout my high school career. do you think penn will assume i am unfocused/ all over the place/ not genuine?

4. Do i have enough leadership positions?

5. Do i have a wow factor? I think that my wow factor comes from the junior achievement side of my interests and the fact that i have run 2 separate successful businesses and i hopefully plan to start a small business before the end of high school. i am also a very social person and if i was to receive an interview i think that could be a wow factor as well.

6. Do you think that because im an asian female, i have smaller chances of acceptance?

7. my old sat score is so low bc i took them very late and that score is the last old sat that was given. i really think if i had one more shot at the old sat i couldve gotten a 2250+ as the first sat i took was a 2060, and by just studying a little more i increased my score by 100 points (no programs or anything, just self study). Do you think penn will know that and take it into consideration if they see that score?

8. i realize that my new sat score is also not up to par, but i had a very rough day that day and plan to get hopefully a 1500+ (i would want a 1550+). I also plan to take the act and would want a 35+. What new sat score/ act score would you recommend with all of my previous stats to really make my chances of acceptance a real possibility?

9. Are my chances too slim to be accepted into Wharton? Do you think I should apply to another school for better acceptance? and if i am deferred/ rejected ED, are my chances slim for RD as well?

Anyone have any good tips for NSO?,Navarine,"If you want to make friends, introduce yourself to as many people as you can off the bat. When I went to Penn a guy in my class spent the entire first week introducing himself to every girl in the quad. He and his roommate would just walk up to girls with open doors and say hi. You're almost guaranteed to be friends with everyone on your hall, but most people stop there and never befriend past the 10 adjacent rooms to their own. You can make numerous acquaintances across your whole dorm though.  By the second week of class you cant really do this anymore, because people don't feel the need to make friends with strangers anymore. For the rest of the year he would always know what's going on on Friday night and he always got a bunch of us formal dates and eventually introduced me to my long term girlfriend. 

For NSO specifically, I had the most fun just walking to different house parties with my friends. It was five years ago, so things could've changed, but almost every off-campus party was open to anyone. During the year you will frequently asked ""who do you know here"" or something of the sort. During NSO though, no one seems to care as much. I personally didn't go to a single organized event, save for the activities fair. The fair is just booths set up along locust walk, but you are guaranteed to find a club/sport you're interested in. ",15,,False,cbbyb6t,False,False,1375021191.0,2013-07-28 09:19:51

Penn Computer Connection - Thoughts?,The_Anti_FAQ,"Hey look, there are some business fundamentals everyone needs to understand, especially pennccx:

  You are a single brick & mortar site, and for that reason alone you will never be truly competitive on price, selection, or service

  The customers you do have are paying the ""stupid tax"" - the extra price paid by people who don't know their options or don't care about them.

  Penn computing has 2 alternatives to achieve uniformity of hardware used by students: enforce or incentivize.  I shouldn't need to explain the many reasons that enforcing it is a bad idea.  That leaves incentivizing, and that's where pennccx could make a difference.  Uniformity is going to cost something - face it.  Subsidize to the point where it becomes the cheapest option.  Some graduate programs here at Penn provide an entire computer to students.  Service it like you understand we can't afford to be without our machines for a day.  Why do machines from pennccx come preloaded with a bunch of bloatware we can't use, and not the things we absolutely need?

  You need a whole new business model.  
  Why not become a walk-in site for Computer Fixer?  
  Why not become a branch of MicroCenter, CDW, Newegg, TigerDirect, Staples, OfficeDepot?  
  Why not set up an Apple Genius Bar, or even better, a Penn Genius Bar?  
  Why not go ""cloud"" and offer access to servers with expensive software on them, or backup services, rather than stock your shelves with those absurd boxes of software?  
  Why not offer low-cost high-quality printing services?  
  Why not employ the students who know better than to buy things at your store to actually work at your store? 
  
  Hell, why not get a team of Wharton students to come in and give your entire business a make-over?

The longer you rely on a moribund business model, the longer you will rely on customers who are just too stupid or lazy to go anywhere else.  They may be a declining market.",4,,1347742281.0,c68n5av,False,False,1347741247.0,2012-09-15 15:34:07

For non-academic products, we use Penn's purchasing clout to buy products in bulk as often as possible to get you the lowest price we can.  The ""overpriced"" preconception is something we try to educate against every day.

As for our store location, we moved to University Square a few years back to make it as convenient as possible for incoming students to pick up their new computers and accessories when they arrived on campus.  The thought was that being next to the Penn Bookstore would make for a quick, one-stop visit.

Penn Computer Connection - Thoughts?,pennccx,"Thanks for your comments, and for raising some valid points.  While we don't have a dedicated ""Genius Bar"", our full-time employees are each enrolled in Apple training and certification programs to keep their knowledge up to date, and most have 10+ years experience helping members of the Penn community.  As mentioned elsewhere, the Computer Connection is a Penn department and the University has an extensive computing support network to help resolve student issues.  While we are primarily pre-sales support, we have support talent in-house.  If we aren't able to resolve your computing issues, we are able to facilitate getting you and the appropriate Penn resource together to get your problem fixed.

We partner with a company called Computer Fixer on Campus for hardware upgrades and the like, and while it may not be while-you-wait service as we don't have their staff on hand the entirety of business hours, we can facilitate memory and storage upgrades on your behalf.

Our computer specifications between the Penn recommended vendors of Apple, Dell, and Lenovo should be fairly comparable by system type.  We focus on specific configurations so we can maximize the discounted pricing each vendor can provide.  This means that while we won't have eight configurations of one particular model, the one we offer is at as low of a price as we can get (usually several hundred to about one thousand dollars below regular retail for the same config), and meets or exceeds the requirements for a four-year career at Penn.

1) Autographed portrait from the University President w/ reddit alien

2) An overhead aerial photo of your school taken w/ proof of intent for submission to Reddit (RC airplanes?)

3) Attend lecture for a day in a home-made reddit alien costume (to raise awareness for our humble subreddits)

Some school pride/history:

1) One headline article from your school newspaper detailing the Nasa Space Program's endeavors to send a man to the moon

2) A translation of home school's motto into english and at least 10 other languages

3) An authentic, perfect transcript (made anonymous and because hell, someone has to have one, right?)

Potential game winners:

1) Get apprehended trying or successfully replace at least 2 other prominent ivy school flags flying at their respective schools with a home school's flag (home-made with a reddit alien on it), and successfully fly the home-made flag

should i take a gap year,DubiousPlan,"Thinking back to my freshman year, the best parts were meeting people and the sense of freedom it gave. Online is not going to be anywhere near a decent replacement. The best parts of Penn for me just aren't there right now.

I feel for the people in your grade. You guys got dealt and terrible hand having some of the best parts of senior year cancelled on you and coming into freshman year online. 

In my opinion, taking the gap year is the way to go, even if you don't have a perfect plan of what to do. You probably aren't the only person among your friends taking a gap year and even those that are taking online classes likely aren't going anywhere. A year delivering pizzas or bagging groceries isn't a bad thing. In fact, it will almost certainly help you grow as a person and appreciate the opportunities you have when you arrive on campus. I'm glad I worked in food service and landscaping (even if it wasn't a gap year) before I showed up at Penn. It helped keep me grounded and steered me away from the rich a-holes who didn't really want to be my friend.

Lastly, a gap year doesn't necessarily mean you don't do anything academic. You're perfectly welcome to start reading about the field you want to study. Especially in social sciences + humanities, most of the actual learning is done via readings. Feel free to email profs for a reading list or what they assign for your course. They appreciate the enthusiasm and interest.

I hope this makes your decision easier and keep in mind it'll probably work out okay no matter what you choose. You're still going to Penn one way or another.",3,,False,g1vmo9r,False,False,1597681854.0,2020-08-17 11:30:54

When school went online, i realized I could no longer do so. I want to make sure I have time in my life to live through the college experience I want for myself. So I am taking a gap year. Do I have a job lined up? No. Am I trying to get one? Yes. I plan on spending my year or semester doing what I love and figuring out what I love to do. Life is long and there isn’t any rush. Penn is gonna be here this year, next year, and 100 years from now. So if you don’t think it’s the right time to start college, don’t. You don’t need anyone else’s approval but your own.

Thoughts on returning to philly even if everything is online,zh_13,"Well I don’t think there would be much of a vibe on campus anyway because it’s not like it’d be a good idea to hang out with more than a few people. 

I haven’t heard of anyone not wanting to come back for “no apparent reason.” It’s more like financial restriction due to no on campus housing and/or just think living in philly for an online education is not worth it. For me, there’s not that much logistic nightmare between living at home vs on campus. I’m assuming that’s the case for you too, so it can seem like a non brainer. But even for American students, they need to weight between the cost of staying on campus and seeing friends in person, or just keeping in touch virtually like they have been for the past few months anyway - which they may be perfectly fine with. Or it may be a bad idea for them to risk being on campus due to having high risk family members. 

I’m leaning toward the former, and I asked this question to see how many people may be in the same lucky situation. But I understand and respect people who choose the latter, even if they technically can come back. Doesn’t mean they don’t have or value friendships.

Any tips on how to do well in BIBB109?,rtc9,"I took it once and dropped because I was doing badly, then took it again and I did pretty well. The relatively unintuitive thing for me was that it can be really helpful to have a study group to share notes and study with for this kind of class. If you don't know anybody, you should introduce yourself to some people and propose this. Type up your notes in a shared drive or something.

Aside from that, the method that worked for me was just making sure to attend every lecture, then rewatch the recordings well in advance of any test, and do EVERY reading at some point. Take note of any lecture slides that require a diagram to explain. These are usually things you will need to spend a while studying on your own. You don't always have to ""keep up"" exactly and I prefer to cram somewhat, but you do need to give yourself reasonable time to immerse yourself in the content and understand everything. I learned after the first exam that it was best for me to pretend each exam was two weeks earlier and cram accordingly. Study by adversarially testing yourself on your weak spots until you get better but don't obsess over anything you don't get right away. You'll get incrementally better with each iteration of review.

Also, try to memorize the brain/neuroanatomy stuff ASAP so you can just focus on plugging the gaps later on. It can feel overwhelming if you are still trying to learn that kind of thing from the ground up right before a test. I didn't use any of the quirky memorization techniques the professor suggested, just looked at pictures and covered up words. The fact that part of the material was learning about learning actually made me better at studying. If anything isn't working for you, re-examine it and adjust your strategy. Force yourself to evaluate the causes of any mistakes you make on exams/assignments.",4,,1590580236.0,fryveu8,False,False,1590578416.0,2020-05-27 06:20:16
Any tips on how to do well in BIBB109?,publu123,"Hey! I used to tutor BBB109. Here are my tips: 

1. Don’t take it in the fall. McClean teaches it in the fall. She uses 100s of slides per lecture, and is extremely dry. In the spring, it alternates between Kane and McGurk, and both of them are two of my best professors at Penn. I had McGurk, and she taught the course with 8 slides per lecture, highly theoretically but with drawing and diagram making designed for you to truly learn the material. I took McClean for one week freshman fall and dropped that shit immediately. McGurk was MUCH better. 
2. Try to absorb in lecture, but honestly, you should listen to the lectures again, slowly. I personally made flash cards for everything (!!!) said in lecture, but you can also make colorful study guides. I think writing things down to force yourself to test understanding is really important. 
2. Get a tutor, go to the group tutoring they offer, use your TA and as a last resort your professor to ask questions weekly on things you don’t understand. Don’t get behind! This stuff builds real bad in the beginning.
