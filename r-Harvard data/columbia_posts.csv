kitachi3,"Hi team,

I'm grateful for everyone who's helped us in our efforts to mitigate the coronavirus so far, but I think it's important to reevaluate our circumstances now; I've changed my mind.

**Who can live on campus?**

Although NYC is doing well (as expected) with its phased reopening process, the virus is still a threat to campus life. Now, we will only allow CC and SEAS students who must be present on campus due to personal (WiFi, quiet space, etc) or academic (lab work, access to special archives, etc) circumstances to live on campus. Housing arrangements for GS undergrads haven't changed.

We'll reevaluate in the spring.

There are two main reasons for this decision:

1. Many of our students come from high-risk areas and would need to self-isolate for two weeks; that isn't realistic, especially for students who are leaving home for the first time.
2. Our social distancing protocol will also be intense; quality of life won't be all that great on campus.

**Will courses be virtual?**

As few undergrads will be on campus, all undergrad courses will be virtual.

Some CU grad schools are using hybrid or in-person models while also taking into account students who won't be able to attend in person due to travel restrictions. \~40% of grad courses will be hybrid or in-person.

Lastly, there is every reason to believe the conditions we're experiencing will continue in one way or another for a while. I'm optimistic, but we gotta be flexible. Let's think of this fall as a phased return of undergrads.

Cheers,

Prezbo",Translation of Prezbo's Update on the Fall Term email,207,1.0,i9r9ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/i9r9ve/translation_of_prezbos_update_on_the_fall_term/,20,1597458077.0,2020-08-14 21:21:17
blue_salsa_7,"tldr: if you don‚Äôt like Bollinger‚Äôs email about next year, burn Butler to the ground or something

Given the Bollinger email delay and the generally unorganized response, I think it is worth bringing this up. The University is not your friend. As much as they seem to care about your best interest, they don‚Äôt. They are most concerned with their bottom line. The bottom line obviously being money, but also retention rate, graduation rate, postgrad employment, etc. 

You might be thinking ‚Äúbut we have NSOP/Bacchanal/free laundry/or whatever‚Äù and I agree those things are nice. However, those aren‚Äôt from the school. You paid for those things with your 70k tuition. The meager tuition reimbursement is a great, recent example of the administration‚Äôs priorities. They simply didn‚Äôt care that you were paying through the nose for online courses.

Now the point of this rant: a professor of mine said something in our last meeting that stuck with me. She urged everyone to speak up if they took issue with the University‚Äôs return plan and explained that the professors have almost zero influence. As students, you hold all the cards and it‚Äôs your job to use them for your benefit because the professors can‚Äôt and the admins won‚Äôt. 

If Bollinger‚Äôs email sucks, make it known: what about it sucks, how it can be fixed, and what you‚Äôll do if it isn‚Äôt. Good luck

To be a reformer within an established tradition‚Äîand to make the tradition truer to its own principles and premises‚Äîis exceedingly difficult and rare in human affairs.  Ruth Bader Ginsburg was such a person.  She challenged and changed the legal system, especially with regard to matters of gender equality, deploying the finest of legal skills, and in doing so validated the law while making it immeasurably better.  Throughout her life and career she exhibited the essence of courage and the belief that reason and ideas can, indeed, improve the world.  We grieve this loss, especially at this moment.

kitachi3,"Hi team,

Times are tough--let's make the most of it.

**Academic Life**

We'll have a three-term cycle. Check out the academic calendar for more details about the timing; we'll accommodate summer internships by splitting the summer semester in half. Commencement is at the end of the spring term as usual.

Courses will almost all have an online option this fall and we intend to have face-to-face classes ASAP.

Faculty can choose how to best run their individual classes and are undergoing training about how to run virtual classes.

To stay up to date, check out the [COVID-19 Resource Guide website](https://covid19.columbia.edu/).¬†

**Undergraduate Residential Life**

We can only accommodate 60% of CC and SEAS due to social distancing rules, but will be able to accommodate the usual amount of GS students in off-campus Columbia housing. 

In the fall, freshmen, sophomores, incoming transfer students, and 3-2 Combined Plan students will be on campus. Students will extenuating circumstances can apply to live on campus as well. If there is extra space after accommodating these students, other students can apply to live on campus in the fall.

After Thanksgiving break, students will leave campus and finish the semester remotely.

Juniors and seniors will be on campus in the spring.

**Campus Life**

Everyone must wear masks unless they are by themselves in a room with the door closed. Physical distancing will be enforced on campus. Students will need to be tested for COVID-19 when they arrive and perform symptom self-checks frequently.

Y'all need to sign a [compact](https://covid19.columbia.edu/health-compact) about COVID-19 precautions.

All of this depends on New York moving to Phase 4 of their reopening plan as expected. If there is a change, new plans will have to be made.

Columbia Global Centers will be adapted and new Pop-Up Global Centers will be created to give international students in-person academic and peer engagement.

CC has partnered with Columbia Global Centers and Columbia World Projects to launch the Global Columbia Collaboratory, an academic experience designed to educate students about COVID-19 and its consequences.

GS is working with Mailman and the School of Social Work to create educational opportunities regarding justice and pandemic preparedness.

Engineering's Columbia Design Challenges will help students understand how engineering, applied science, and other disciplines can tackle issues such as climate change, social distancing, and pandemics.

There are counselors and specialists for students at the [Columbia Morningside](https://health.columbia.edu/content/counseling-and-psychological-service) and [Columbia University Irving Medical Center](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/student-health/mental-health-services) campuses, while there are resources for faculty at the [Employee Assistance Program](https://humanresources.columbia.edu/employee-assistance). [Religious Life](https://religiouslife.columbia.edu/content/contact-us) also offers pastoral counseling.

,"Email from Lee:

""Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:  


I am writing this evening to notify everyone that, because a member of our community has been quarantined as a result of exposure to the Coronavirus (COVID-19), we have decided to suspend classes on Monday and Tuesday. This suspension of activities will allow us to prepare to shift to remote classes for the remainder of the week. I want to emphasize that the individual who has been quarantined has not been diagnosed at this point with the virus.¬†  


Please understand that the decision to suspend classes does not mean that the University is shutting down. All non-classroom activities, including research, will continue in accordance with the new travel and events restrictions announced recently. At this point, just to restate what is important to know, we do not have a confirmed case of the virus on campus. This action is intended to prevent the virus from spreading.¬†  


This message will soon be followed by more specific information from deans and other University leaders, including plans for remote instruction beginning Wednesday and continuing until the start of Spring Break on Friday.¬†  


Let me say how much we appreciate the efforts of everyone who is helping us work our way through this challenging situation and your understanding and attention. As always, we are especially committed to providing updates as we have more information and recommendations.¬†  


Sincerely,

notia81,"the professor for IEOR ML decided to host the exam in his personal zoom room instead of the columbia email invite. All he did was post the invite on Piazza without giving any more detail about it. So obviously no one is going to compare the room numbers etc. This is also our first virtual class and it's our midterm.

We sit in the official columbia zoom invite room for like 30 minutes into the exam thinking that he was just late. Only to miss instructions about timings, submissions, etc... Panic search for any other zoom invite and then finally stumble into his personal zoom room to finish the rest the exam.

The professor then says he had no idea that there was another room.

TheMoreOne,"Gonna risk a nerdy post because I see a lot of discouragement around here lately, and a lot of focus on these little things along the way.  It's really easy to get wrapped up in the minutia of grades and assignments, and just how much this virus is messing things up, only to forget the big picture.  You're at fucking Columbia, literally one of the best institutions in the world, and you're here for a reason.

This virus came along and moved our cheese.  That sucks, and it's totally right to be discouraged and annoyed.  Online is nothing like the ""real"" thing, and with this P/F situation you may not receive the ""reward"" of the grade you've been working for this semester.  But you are still achieving the purpose of the reason you are here, to gain an education and pursue your dreams.  Just now you get to do it without wearing any pants.

I've attended various colleges, lived a life without any form of higher education, and I've seen first hand that the privilege that Columbia is (still) offering you is greater than the majority of people will ever see in their lives.  This will be but a little blip on your radar in a few years and a story to tell.

Ellipses_Points,"Posting this here mostly just to get it off my chest, but I also hope to get some advice from older alumni or my peers in the class of 2020.

These past couple days, I've felt more disillusioned about Columbia than I ever have before. Graduation, I worry, had the opposite effect than what was intended: I feel dispirited, under-recognized, and excluded.

Much of the problem surely has to do with this year's Commencement being online. I haven't seen most of my friends since mid-March -- I didn't get to hug them goodbye, share in their excitement for the future, or reminisce about the four years past. Instead I spent the moment I had thought about for years watching the TV with my mom and brother, trying to make the most of a very ordinary rainy day.

But all of that is, of course, only part of the story. COVID has taken something from everyone, and a couple days on the South Lawn listening to bittersweet speeches is a comparatively small thing to be deprived of. I am privileged to have spent the day with a healthy, loving family, in a home and livelihood left intact by the crisis. I am privileged even to have graduated, really.

There's something a little more insidious, though, that I felt creeping into the past couple days' festivities (if you can call them that). I'm not even sure this has anything to do with the pandemic, so it's really the thing I'm seeking advice about.

I majored in philosophy with the assurance that it's what I love to learn about, and has been since the beginning of High School. I've known for a long time that I wanted to head to graduate school after Columbia to get my PhD and then, hopefully, teach. When I got to Columbia, I found that there was a small cohort of students majoring in philosophy with the same goals, and that there was a general air of competition among these people. So I avoided them -- I never extended my familiarity with them beyond acquaintance, and I tried at every turn to avoid measuring my achievements against theirs. All of this was with the hope that I could do my own thing for four years and still do enough to compete with these folks for placement in a good graduate program (for which I will apply this year).

I worked my ass off for years, I poured my soul into a thesis that I suspect only my advisor read. But graduation -- especially that reading of the names of students being recognized for one or another special reason -- has made me feel like it wasn't enough. I didn't secure any sort of honors (college or departmental), I feel like I made no lasting impression on my professors or peers, and I feel no real sense of pride at all. My GPA was 3.68, which is not bad by any stretch. And yet I just feel steeped in mediocrity.

I'm not sure I'm even cut out for graduate school. I love Philosophy -- it's an enormous part of my life and sense of self. But the students in my department who have been recognized to such an extent by the university -- they love philosophy too, maybe even more than me. Maybe they worked harder, maybe they built lasting relationships with the professors. I don't know. But if *these* are the people I'd have to compete with in applying to graduate schools or securing a job in academia, I'm not sure I'd make the cut. Especially not with the incoming economic disaster.

So I guess I wanted to confess all of this, and maybe solicit some consolation from people who are feeling (or have felt) the same. The old adage has helped to get me through the past couple days, to some extent: *compare and despair*. I know that life sometimes deals you a hand of cards you don't like -- I'm just a little lost. Thanks for reading my whining if you made it this far. Stay safe and healthy.

EDIT: My deep thanks to everyone for their useful and compassionate responses so far. I really appreciate that you took the time out of your day to help me think through these feelings.

happyfish2019,"TLDR: looks like there will be both full semester classes and 7 week intensive options; a mix of in person and remote so students have the option of taking what is best for them; and they're planning on offering as many in-person things as they can. Still a lot of questions obviously, but it's better than what we knew before?

Dear Members of the Barnard Community,

I hope that you and your loved ones are well as the nation continues to weather the pandemic and struggles in its reckoning with the anti-Black violence made so visible by the brutal events of these past months. Please know that we are thinking about each of you and our future together. We continue to believe that Barnard must make a distinctive contribution to these historic challenges through teaching, learning, scholarship, and collective action, and in that spirit I write to you today to update you on new aspects of our curriculum and on our current plans for a safe return to campus in the fall.¬†

Faculty, staff, students, and administrators have been working in various capacities to help plan for the upcoming academic year.¬† As President Beilock mentioned in her [May 14 email](https://alert.barnard.edu/news/looking-forward-2020-21-academic-year), we will share a detailed plan for the Fall semester by early July. While many important decisions have yet to be made, there is significant clarity on several parts of the year ahead that I am happy to share with you now.¬†

Most importantly, Barnard will be open for some form of both academic instruction and student life this fall. We will offer as many opportunities for in-person experiences, residential living, and co-curricular activities as possible, subject to rigorous public health and safety constraints, including from New York State, New York City, local health departments, and the CDC.¬†

**The Academic Year Calendar**

Our [calendar for the Academic Year](https://barnard.edu/academic-calendar) is now set. As always, it is aligned with the calendar of Columbia University to ensure that all our students can take full advantage of the myriad options available to undergraduates at both institutions.¬†

Students will have the flexibility to plan their academic year courses over a significantly more expansive period of time that includes both the traditional Fall and Spring semesters and a new Summer term. There will be no extra tuition fees for summer courses.

The Fall semester will begin as planned on September 8 and will end on December 23. We will be flexible and supportive in offering classes in multiple formats. All classes will be offered remotely or in a high-flex modality that allows for both in-class and online delivery of instruction. We are making significant investments in classroom technology and in pedagogic training that will enhance the quality of all of our courses as they are delivered in this new format.¬†

The Spring semester will begin one week earlier than planned, on January 11, and Commencement will be held after the conclusion of the Spring semester in the last week of April. Specific dates for both the Barnard and University Commencements will be forthcoming, as well as a date for the in-person Commencement for the Barnard Class of 2020 that we were unable to hold this past spring.

The Summer term will be split into two unique six-week periods, which should allow students who want to take classes and pursue internship or summer employment opportunities the ability to do so. Each of the Fall and Spring semesters will also be divided into two equal parts ‚Äî Part A and Part B ‚Äî to enable students to take a host of immersive seven-week classes in addition to their semester-long courses. The goal of these immersive classes is to allow our students to take a reduced load of classes that offer a depth of engagement and learning over a shorter and more intensive period of time.

Detailed information on class registration for this new schedule will be available in early July.

**New and Innovative Curriculum**

Our exceptional faculty have been working to redesign aspects of our curriculum that¬† adjust to the three-term calendar and to the new immersive course format. As always, but in a more focused way than ever, they have also been developing new courses that will address the ‚Äúbig problems‚Äù we face in 2020. These courses will be focused on major challenges confronting society and the planet now and with an eye to the future.

As part of our focus on big problems, we will be offering a campus-wide lecture series that brings leading scholars and practitioners to campus virtually as we tackle as a community the key issues facing us today. Concurrent with this lecture series, we will introduce a new and exciting component to our First-Year Writing and First-Year Seminar classes that will bring students together in their sections to discuss the lecture and engage the content. Students will create a final group project that will be in dialogue with the lecture series and will be archived for historical purposes. Additional new classes will be created across the academic divisions that link to the College-wide lectures and address the significant issues of this challenging time.

We are excited about the new curricular options that will be available to students and energized by our faculty‚Äôs rigorous focus on best practices for online learning.¬†

While we wait for the fall, we know that many in our community are eager to address the injustices and inequalities that are currently playing out in the protests taking place in our country and the world. To that end, and as Vice President Ariana Gonz√°lez Stokas wrote in her [most recent message to campus](https://barnard.edu/news/work-racial-justice), the College will offer an ongoing time ‚Äúto reflect, respond, understand, enact, and reimagine racial justice at Barnard and how to work on anti-racism in our own lives and communities.‚Äù These virtual gatherings, which will begin on Monday, June 22, and will occur each Monday over the summer from 9 to 10 a.m., are available to all students, faculty, and staff, and will provide space for dialogue, support, and the study of racial justice. Please email [diversitycouncil@barnard.edu](mailto:diversitycouncil@barnard.edu) for the Zoom link and further details.¬†

**A Ramp-Up of Laboratory Research This Summer**

While the campus has been mostly quiet since mid-March, we are pleased to announce that we are phasing-in a gradual reopening of laboratory research for faculty, beginning on Monday, June 22. Our return to research lab use will require strict adherence to New York State guidance and our own detailed safety protocols. Our faculty researchers are excited to resume their research this summer with the goal of incorporating some student research into our science labs in the fall.

**Next Steps**

I know that you still have many questions about living and learning at Barnard for the forthcoming academic year. Please know we are working to provide you with this information as soon as possible. As we pursue the goal of being together on campus this fall, we are acutely aware of the unpredictability of the pandemic. In the coming weeks, our various committees focused on [fall planning](https://alert.barnard.edu/2020-21-planning) will continue to refine their plans in consultation with local City and State governments, as well as medical and epidemiological experts. Our goal is to be as flexible as possible in how we implement the 2020-2021 academic year as we focus on our shared pursuit of teaching, scholarship, and research.

Finally, we are deeply grateful to the many who have worked with us on every aspect of our return to campus. Their significant contributions to our collective efforts will continue to lead to strong decisions and, beyond that, help shape and define the Barnard community‚Äôs responses to the exigencies of this time. Our highest goal of this moment is to learn in and from these circumstances so that, together, we may be agile, resilient, responsive, and creative as we serve our society.¬†

clover-ly,"Presbo's email:

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

As promised, I am writing with an update on how the University needs to respond to the outbreak of COVID-19. We all know this is a rapidly evolving and very challenging situation. Yesterday afternoon, the World Health Organization officially declared this to be a pandemic. Thus far, we continue to have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on our campuses. Just to be clear, the principle that has guided us up to this point is to maintain the mission of the University as much as possible consistent with preserving the health of every part of our community. To that end, as of yesterday, we launched nearly 2,000 classes online and continue to prepare to teach classes virtually for the remainder of the semester.

In light of the spread of the virus, especially in the New York metropolitan region, we now need to take further steps. Specifically, in order to reduce the density of our residential environment, while respecting the interests and needs of students who have reason to continue to remain in residence on campus, we are instituting three critical decisions: (1) The University will remain open and functioning; (2) All classes for the remainder of the semester will be conducted online; and (3) We encourage any students who are able to move out of undergraduate residence halls for the rest of the semester to do so, and we are ready to help in that process. The Office of University Life and your school will follow up with more information.

It is worth repeating that our campuses will remain open. However, we have restrictions in place for those who have traveled to severely affected areas, as per guidance from the CDC. We will, as indicated previously, actively discourage congregations in large numbers. We also strongly discourage holding any events with over 25 people, at least through April 30th. All Columbia business travel, both international and domestic, is now suspended for all affiliates.

This is a hard time for all of us. We are concerned about every student, colleague, friend, and neighbor. Clearly, balancing all of the interests of all parts of the institution is an extraordinarily complex undertaking. I am so grateful to all of you and especially to those who daily help us chart the right course for Columbia through this crisis. 

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger","Online for the rest of the semester, students 'encouraged to move out'",82,1.0,fhhffd,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/fhhffd/online_for_the_rest_of_the_semester_students/,29,1584053184.0,2020-03-12 17:46:24

Quil0n,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

As one of the most perplexing and difficult semesters in memory draws to an end, I write now with some updates on the shape of the summer and the academic year to come.¬†

Let me just begin by expressing, once again, our genuine gratitude for the extraordinary ways in which every member of the University community has responded to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, first and foremost, of course, our colleagues at the Medical Center. This has been a spring for the ages, and my deepest hope is that the goodwill and collective effort manifested in this crisis will continue to sustain us in the months and years ahead. At this very moment, I am especially thinking of our graduating classes and of how our campus would ordinarily be filled with the anticipation of one of the most uplifting and magnificent academic ceremonies on the planet. Though we will all gather virtually for these milestone events, having to forego what we wish most for will only magnify the feelings of warm connection we will have in the years to come with the Class of 2020. As I plan to say on Commencement day, these strange and frightening times have most certainly deepened our collective appreciation of the University‚Äôs many vital roles in society, beginning with the search for fundamental knowledge and carried through to the care of humanity and the world.¬†

As disjointed as this moment has come to feel, as filled as it is with deep uncertainties, we must move forward. I write first, then, about the state of our research.¬†

Over the last several weeks, we have developed an intricate plan for returning to laboratory research that has necessarily been suspended. Following the guidance of our public health experts, and pending the approvals from the State to ease stay-at-home orders in New York City, we will gradually allow our faculty and certain graduate students to return to their lab research sites, ensuring, most of all, of course, the safety of our community. It is our hope that this plan can be activated as early as June. Ira Katznelson has communicated the details of our schedule and the conditions to our researchers.

We also have been intensely focused on the general form of our next academic year. We all wish to return to in-person instruction and campus life, and our intent is to make that possible as soon as it is safe to do so. The hard fact is, however, that we just cannot predict now when that moment will arrive. Yet, we can put in place structures that maximize prospects for that outcome and offer meaningful steps along the way. Our primary goal must be to create as rich an academic experience as possible, in whatever form that will take, while preparing to bring us back together at the earliest feasible moment. No doubt social distancing techniques will be with us for some time, which, of course, complicates the logistics of the return. Taking these and other factors into account, we have made one key decision: to prepare to use the three upcoming academic terms‚Äîfall 2020, spring 2021, and summer 2021‚Äîas a unit of time in order to provide us with the greatest amount of flexibility in organizing our educational experiences.¬†

By leveraging a longer period of time, we will be able to de-densify our campus so that all students may experience much, if not most, of their coursework in person over the arc of the three terms. While this is just the beginning of a University-wide effort to determine the specifics of the academic year, we now have the capacity to tap into the rich expertise and creativity of our University leaders and faculty to shape the substance and content of this one-time arrangement. By July 1, Ira Katznelson, our spectacular deans, and I will have more details to share about how the three terms will be composed.¬†

May is always filled with the sense of exhilaration of admitting new classes across our schools and colleges. It is natural to wonder‚Äîand we have‚Äîhow the understandable anxieties among our prospective students about how the current crisis will affect their beginnings at Columbia will in turn affect their college plans. Amid such uncertainty, it gives me great pleasure and pride to share that all we now know suggests we will welcome one of the most talented and formidable cohorts of new students this fall. As with their predecessors, these exceptional individuals will add immeasurably to the intellectual life at Columbia, perhaps even more than usual because they have already displayed a kind of courage and fortitude to maintain a steady course in the search for knowledge.

One can only feel a sense of humility in the face of the broad human response as we grapple with a threat as menacing as COVID-19. And one can only feel thankful for our universities and for Columbia, in particular. New York City is almost always the epicenter of crises that strike this nation, and Columbia University in the City of New York is, therefore, too. This is not exactly to be wished for, but it does create, over time, an intellectual character that is grounded in the hard realities of existence. And, on balance, inhabiting a space imbued with that character is where I would rather be. I trust that view is shared by everyone at Columbia.¬†

From the President‚Äôs House, Jean and I send you our very best.¬†

Temporary098,"Do y'all know that one African American woman that swipes people into John Jay? She has short hair and glasses. Well I think she is excessively rude. I understand that she deals with hundreds (if not thousands) of people a day, but there's no need to make me feel like an idiot or a child everytime I entire the dining hall. If she was just DMV level rude I would be fine, but this is next level. Here are some examples:

- Very recently I asked about the meal options for restrictive diets and she quickly said ""I'm not telling you, it's none of your business. It doesn't apply to you"". Immediately she assumed my religion and dietary restrictions based on my appearance. The options very well could have applied to me as I have both Jewish and Muslim family members. 

- Another day she handed me back the wrong ID and actually tried to argue with me that it was mine. I don't know what was implied by her assumption of my appearance again, but I don't think I looked anything like the person on the wrong ID she handed me. Needless to say I was offended and embarrassed by the scene she caused.

- Just today she tried to tell me that I was returning my EcoReps box incorrectly, when just days prior SHE is the one who rudely told me to do it that way. 

There are so many more rude things she has said and done to me in that short window of time from swiping in to exiting. 

And I'm not normally a complainer or one to get offended, but this is just irritating. I'm definitely not spoiled either. She just makes me feel stupid and uncomfortable while I'm just trying to eat.

Everyone else in John Jay is so nice. Particular the woman that works behind the grain bowl station and the woman at the action station. They really make up for the swiping lady's bullshit.

This phrase has sort of gained a bad rep at Columbia and it's often associated with ""high-ground"" pseudo-intellectuals who cherry-pick edge cases just to sound smart.

Also, make sure you understand the original argument before engaging (you can restate it just to check for understanding). Too many in-class debates start with unintentional strawman arguments. If you start firing away at the wrong premise, it can look like you're more interested in arguing than listening or developing the discussion, which isn't a good look.

biggestcuckalive,"I realize how stupid of a post this is but I don‚Äôt really care. Basically just what the title says. 

Everyone around me is passionate about something and has all these activities they excel at and derive pleasure from. Me, I‚Äôm good at my classes (high chance I‚Äôll finish the semester with a 3.8-4.0) and am part of the Music performance program and a religious club but apart from that I‚Äôve really got nothing going for me.

I think that I am a nice friend to my friends and a good girlfriend. But it doesn‚Äôt really feel those good qualities are even worth anything in today‚Äôs economy, plus it doesn‚Äôt make sense to expect someone to hire me because I‚Äôm nice lmao. 

I didn‚Äôt win any prestigious competitions and I don‚Äôt have an ambition to end gender inequality or whatever. I‚Äôm just not driven like that. I like to learn and observe and be privy to cool things but I don‚Äôt know if I have what it takes to actually engineer the cool things. 

I feel so hopeless and mediocre. 

I‚Äôm not stupid but I‚Äôm not a genius. I don‚Äôt have a plan for the future. I don‚Äôt know what I want to do career wise but it feels like the decisions are collapsing in on me. It feels like everyone around me has figured it out. People are landing internships already and building projects and portfolios and I‚Äôm just studying for my classes and watching TV. 

I just want to read books and enjoy my life. Columbia is such a high pressure environment and even though everyone is stressed I still feel isolated. I know logically I can‚Äôt be alone but I can‚Äôt think of a single person who might feel the way I do.

,"Dear Undergraduate Students,

We write to you to unequivocally denounce a deeply disturbing racially charged incident involving Columbia undergraduates that took place in front of Butler Library and JJ‚Äôs Place early this morning.

Many of you have heard about or seen the alarming footage online, which includes painful language directed toward students of color in our community. Although we cannot comment on the proceedings, this incident is already under investigation by the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, and we want to assure you that it will be investigated thoroughly, beginning with interviews of witnesses.

We are alarmed at the rise of incidents of racism and hate speech in our world today. It is more important than ever that we continually demonstrate our core values and restate our commitment to a diverse, inclusive community on campus. At Columbia, we stand firmly against white supremacist language and violence. As we said last week, our community will not waver in its support for those of any faith, race, gender, sexual orientation, background or identity.

We understand this may be a difficult time for you and your classmates. Members of our on-call team began to provide individual support as soon as we learned of the incident. If you need support this evening, please reach out to your RA, who will connect you to additional resources as necessary.

All undergraduate students are invited to an open reflection space tomorrow night, Monday, December 10, 6:00-8:00 p.m. in Lerner Hall 505, hosted by Multicultural Affairs, for students to be in community with each other. Additional areas of support will be announced as we are able to plan.

Our collective work toward peace, respect and understanding must continue, both within our community and society at large.

Sincerely,

Mary C. Boyce
Dean of The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science

Lisa Rosen-Metsch
Dean of the School of General Studies

James J. Valentini

,"Okay so here goes nothing. My father works at Columbia and was put on the Covid advisory board (meaning he's been working closely with prezbo). I'm honestly exhausted and going through a myriad of emotions right now, and feel like playing ringmaster with all of you reddit fucks. Believe me or not,  I don't care.

Also, I'm a third generation legacy, so Columbia is a family thing for me, so I don't feel as bad about doing this. Yes, I do have that enlarged chin and mushed forehead that shows incest is part of my family lineage. That's most of us at Columbia anyways. 

Here are the next semester plans:

1. No doubles. If you're in a double, you'll have to decide w your roommate who keeps the room and who goes into a separate lottery for the people kicked out. Same goes for the rare triple.
2. No students from some countries. Don't want to send anyone in a panic so I won't say what countries, but some are obvious as they have their own travel restrictions.
3. Large classes online, small classes in larger lecture halls
4. New York students stay home unless there's exceptional circumstances. Only applies to Manhattan and Bronx students.
5. Violent cleaning In the dorms tto prevent the spread of germs. Every Saturday
6. Low Beach, more like NO BEACH haha you get it
7. Club meetings, no more. Must all be done on zoom. 
8. Libraries? Nope. Only to get books and then you have to leave

hope this helped. you will all come back to this tomorrow, shocked ;)

After countless hours of analysis, debating, and deep self-reflecrion, I realized I lack the expertise to find the answer I seek. So, as a humbled and broken man, I come to here as a last resort in hopes of salvation. So my question is:

Where is the first place I should eat at after moving to NYC?

I am talking the best food! I want it to blow my hair back. I want to see God (even though I am not religious). After the meal, I want to be inspired to commit my life to building a time machine just so I can go back and relive the experience of tasting it for the first time over and over again.

this feeling of deep academic dissatisfaction and mediocrity is gnawing at me and it feels like an overwhelming and heart-beat skipping sense of d√©j√† vu from high school. I had 12 credits, 12 CREDITS, last semester‚Äîall introductory class‚Äîand I had a B+ average. Yes, a 3.33 gpa, everyone. First semester of freshman year. I am an international student majoring in philosophy. I have no fucking chance in the job-market. I am mediocrely intelligent at best. I am not beautiful, I am not rich, ad infinitum. I thought I tried my best last semester. I thought I was on the right path...but nothing NOTHING seems to ever EVER give me those sweet As that I feel I need.

I cannot believe that my friends, my boyfriend, and all the peers around me are just so capable. My boyfriend who barely studies past midnight, who does not give a shit about grades got on the Dean's List and I was struggling to get a full night's sleep usually. 

I can't help but feel that this is a diagnosis for how my life will be here on out. Wallowing in mediocrity, constantly comparing myself to others, constantly being proved right that I am, in the end, solidly and pathetically gob-smack in the middle no matter how fucking hard I try.

B00YouWhore,"Here's my TL;DW I sent to my homies and what the COVID testing was like for me (did it today) - hope this helps in some way.

If you wanna watch the whole YouTube vid - it was Zoom but then they gave a YouTube link so that's good - here it is:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzY1DW0lRQw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzY1DW0lRQw) 

I MAY HAVE MISSED INFO - PLEASE CORRECT ME - AND THIS STUFF IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE

In no particular order...

We will get free Columbia face masks (2 in a pack)

Dining will open as usual + Can order dining meals (for those with meal plan) the day before for in-residence delivery if requested

Dodge gym is looking at the new gym guidelines (33% capacity) with intent to open like other gyms across the city.

Libraries (6 of them) will open August 31st - Yes, Butler is one of them. Required that student takes gateway COVID test, sign compact, and have a daily green pass via app.

Study spaces are reserved (by appointment I think)

\-So far, Butler stacks will be closed (sad)

\-Open 6 days a week. Not for 24 hours but tentatively will open at 8am and work from there

\-There‚Äôs contactless scanning and book delivery offered on side entrance of Butler

\-Printing services will be provided (contactless)

\-Columbia COVID testing requirement is not met through outside test results. However the ramp up research test from previous months counts because it was through Columbia (Rationale: Columbia has the best tests - what they said, not me. I don't know crap.)

IMPORTANT:

If compact for social distancing, mask wearing, etc in the signed compact via the REOPENCU app is violated, there will be sanctions. These will escalate with multiple infractions that can result in loss of access to campus or even loss of residential housing.

Friday Sept 4 is the LAST DAY to get your COVID test. Do not wait til the last minute. There may be a crazy influx. There are many many appointments available now.

&#x200B;

MY COVID TESTING EXPERIENCE TODAY:

So I made the appointment via [covid19.columbia.edu](https://covid19.columbia.edu). I scrolled down to 5. Get Tested. Scrolled down to Appointment Scheduling. Clicked on Online Patient Portal. Logged in with UNI and entered date of birth. Clicked Appointments on left hand tab. Bubbled in COVID testing (I picked Lerner) and made appointment (within same hour. So many appointments available atm). They gave me a QR code to show at testing place (Lerner Hall for me).

WHAT IT WAS LIKE:

Went to Lerner and showed lady behind desk my green pass via the ReopenCU app (you get this by clicking you have no symptoms and is super easy to use since it remembers your UNI so login is fast). She asked for the QR code. I showed it and scanned my CUID to enter. Stayed to the right and walked down the ramp where I was directed to a check in station manned by person who scanned the QR and asked for my Date of Birth. Then entered the auditorium and confirmed my DOB again and signed the agreement to be tested. Went to station with lady in full body suit and face shield.

You blow your nose to get it moist (I think that's why).

Discard tissue in trashcan beside you.

Sanitize hands.

Receive a Q-tip and very easily rub it against the inside of your nose (towards face). It goes in only about half an inch and you twist it around a few times. Then you do it with the other nostril and give it back. Sanitize your hands again and you're good to go.

You leave through the side entrance where another person gives you a SPECIAL STICKER to go on the back of your CUID and you get a COLUMBIA FACE MASK. Each pack has 2 with two different designs. One with a Columbia Logo in bottom right corner and the other with the word COLUMBIA in the same spot. They are very cozy and have adjustable straps to fit to your face.

THEY DO NOT WORK WELL IF YOU HAVE GLASSES because there is no wiring to have it conform to your nose. My glasses fogged up immediately but I FIXED IT  in under a minute with a small incision to the inside top part of the fabric and fitted a paperclip into the stitching and now it conforms to my face with no fogging. Easy to do.

Hope this helps with any anxiety about the test. No blood. No crazy long Q-tip.

jacyf02,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:
 
This is the message I hoped never to have to convey. I must report the first deaths from COVID-19 within our own extended Columbia community. In recent days, we have lost family members, neighbors, and now at Columbia, we have lost valued employees and one of our own students. Of course, the mortality rate nationally and globally is staggering, but the shock is always greater when the losses occur within your own home and community. I am sure many of you are suffering under the spread of the virus, being personally afflicted or caring for those who are, all the while carrying on with coursework and other responsibilities. Please know we think about you and the burden of these experiences every day.
 
This past week, I, along with Dr. Lee Goldman, visited inpatient units, an ICU, the Emergency Department, and an outpatient tent at our Medical Center. It is always remarkable to see our faculty, students, and staff in the health sciences provide such superb care to the sick under unimaginable circumstances while at the same time seeking to rapidly generate new knowledge that can help others. These are among the most challenging conditions, filled with anxiety and distress, and everyone is rising to the moment. 
 
In the few short weeks since many of you left campus, several of Columbia‚Äôs most familiar sites have been commissioned into service, including Baker Field, where the hospital is in the process of expanding its facilities. Emptied Morningside campus residence halls are now being used by CUIMC and hospital employees to ease their commutes. Our Libraries and our Engineering School are both producing face shields. All this, along with the research we continue to conduct and the additional intellectual and physical resources we expect to devote to this pandemic in the future, makes us proud.
 
And, in the final weeks of the semester, it is heartening to know that the academic work of the University continues. We are currently teaching a total of 9,622 courses online‚Äîsomething we previously would not have imagined possible. Continuing with this effort to maintain the functions of the University into the summer, we now expect to offer over 1,800 courses online.
 
There are two additional developments to note here: With respect to Commencement, individual schools will offer virtual Class Days during that previously designated week. And the University Commencement ceremony will be recorded and shared virtually on May 20th. We still hope to have at some later time an in-person celebration, but it is, unfortunately, not possible at this moment to be more specific.
 
Lastly, there has been an outpouring of inquiries about what each person might do to help in this crisis. I am happy to say that there is now a consolidated list on our COVID-19 website of ways you might assist and contribute to others. We expect to add more opportunities as they arise.
 
I want to return to what I said at the outset. I wish I could do more than just express our sense of sadness and loss. I do feel strongly, however, that this is a period when the strengths of universities are manifest and should be recognized. We lodge the professions within our universities, in part because we value and benefit from their expertise but also because we want to nurture a sense of public responsibility as being inherent in these societal roles. The journalist who enters war zones, the lawyer who fights for human rights, and the health worker who braves dangers of infection to aid the ill, all reflect the commitment to the selfless dedication of expertise that universities naturally nurture. As always, however, it is one thing to affirm this commitment, as we regularly do, and another to live it, as we are now seeing so vividly in our Medical Center. It is, therefore, to be celebrated, as an example for us all to follow.
 
Finally, I would say, if ever there was a time that proves, yet again, that the subjects and preoccupations of the humanities are of transcendent importance in a good life, this is surely one of those.
 
From the President‚Äôs House, Jean and I send our warmest regards. 
 
Sincerely,

Dear Members of the Barnard Community,

Since we moved to virtual instruction in March, our most immediate priority has been keeping members of our community safe, which continues. At the same time, as an intentional community of students and scholars, we are anxious to recover the vibrant intellectual experiences that happen when we gather together in person.¬†

Faculty, staff, and administrators, with students‚Äô and families‚Äô input (including from the survey [launched on May 14](https://alert.barnard.edu/news/looking-forward-2020-21-academic-year)), have put in countless hours on several [working groups](https://alert.barnard.edu/2020-21-planning) to devise a plan that we are confident we can implement safely for the upcoming academic year. In addition to my service on education advisory committees in both New York State and New York City, we have been engaged in discussions with higher education institutions in the City and across the nation. Equipped with guidance at the [federal](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/index.html) and [state](https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/governor.ny.gov/files/atoms/files/Higher_Education_Detailed_Guidelines.pdf) level, and in close consultation with medical and public health experts, we now have the opportunity to begin a new journey together.¬†

This upcoming academic year will look and feel quite different. Nonetheless, our commitment to academic excellence and the student experience is stronger than ever, accompanied by a relentless focus on equipping our students with what they‚Äôll need to develop knowledge and create solutions to the historic challenges we face as a society. The following is a summary of our academic and operational planning.

**Academic and Co-Curricular Experience**

This moment in time demands that our students ‚Äî guided by their faculty and supported by their institution ‚Äî examine what the global and national crises we are living through reveal about scientific knowledge, existing power structures, historical value systems, and the institutions that produce and reinforce them. Many of our courses will ask questions about what our world will look like as we move forward. Students will be encouraged to take action ‚Äî with local government or community-based organizations, or on their own ‚Äî to effect change.

* This fall, all first-years will take part in a new component of the first-year experience called ‚ÄúBig Problems: Making Sense of 2020.‚Äù This course will have two elements: a series of lectures by prominent thought leaders who will contextualize the current moment and small discussion sections in which students will think critically about how COVID-19 and our country‚Äôs historical injustices have generated social, economic, political, and ecological upheavals.¬†
* Many classes across the curriculum will focus on the current moment, asking students to use different disciplinary lenses to interrogate and learn from this time in history, building off of similar classes in [economics](https://cep.barnard.edu/interview-belinda-archibong-assistant-professor-economics), [environmental science](https://cep.barnard.edu/interview-brian-mailloux-professor-environmental-science-and-co-chair-environmental-science), [anthropology](https://cep.barnard.edu/interview-paige-west-claire-tow-professor-anthropology), and other departments and programs.
* [ThirdSpace@Barnard](https://athenacenter.barnard.edu/thirdspace), a new co-curricular program available to all students, will consider and create possibilities for a new world in light of the societal fissures laid bare this year. Focused on three areas ‚Äî community safety, economic security, and education ‚Äî this program will introduce students to the work of changemakers (from politics to the arts and more) and facilitate projects and engagement designed to address challenges in their own communities.¬†

You can expect to see some changes to the class experience:¬†

* We have joined the larger Columbia community in making changes to the [academic calendar](https://barnard.edu/academic-calendar), enabling students to take classes over a Fall, Spring, and Summer term and to take immersive classes that occur in an A or B block for each semester.¬†
* All classes will be offered remotely, with many classes offered in a ‚Äúhigh-flex‚Äù modality that allows for simultaneous in-person instruction. Large lecture classes will only be offered remotely.¬†
* Any student who wishes to study remotely for all or any part of the year is welcome to do so.
* International students who study remotely will have opportunities to be involved in academic programming at the [Columbia University Global Centers](https://globalcenters.columbia.edu/) around the world.
* Students will be able to confirm and change their course registration in late July and August.
* Academic departments will host a Launch Week July 20-24 to help orient students to changes to the curriculum and new modes of teaching, including immersive courses, in advance of the re-registration period.

**Feel Well, Do Well 2020-2021: Health and Safety**

In 2019, we launched [Feel Well, Do Well](https://barnard.edu/health-wellness), an initiative designed to make students‚Äô health and wellness a college-wide endeavor, beyond just the Rosemary Furman Counseling Center and Primary Care Health Service. Although we did not know it at the time, starting a campus-wide conversation around health and wellness was a precursor to what we must ask of our community until an effective vaccine or treatment is found for COVID-19. Creating a culture in which everyone at Barnard understands how their individual decisions impact others and acts accordingly is paramount to the health and safety of the whole community. Collectively, we will do the following to keep our campus healthy:¬†

* All community members will wear a face covering in public spaces, maintain physical distancing wherever possible, and practice good personal hygiene habits, such as frequent hand-washing and covering coughs.
* A self-screening questionnaire will be completed by members of our community each day they come on campus; residential students will also be regularly screened via questionnaire.
* All community members will take part in a robust COVID-19 testing, contact tracing and isolation program to further monitor and manage the health of our campus.¬†
   * Barnard has partnered with [MiraDx](https://miradx.com/covid-19-testing/) and is consulting with experts at Columbia University Irving Medical Center to conduct regularly scheduled testing of asymptomatic people across our campus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.¬†¬†
   * All faculty, students, and staff will be required to complete an initial PCR test upon arrival to campus at the start of the school year and take part in testing at regular intervals throughout the semester.¬†
   * Regularly testing asymptomatic individuals helps us understand the prevalence of COVID-19 within our campus community and flexibly adapt as conditions change.
   * As always, for symptomatic individuals, diagnostic testing will be provided through the [Primary Care Health Service](https://barnard.edu/primarycare) for students and through one‚Äôs local health care provider for faculty and staff.¬†
   * All members of the community are expected to participate in contact tracing protocols to help reduce further infection once a positive case has been identified.
   * When positive or symptomatic cases are identified, everyone will observe our established quarantine/isolation protocols.¬†
   * Nonessential travel is discouraged for all students, faculty, and staff.
* Part of the *Feel Well, Do Well* campaign for the coming year will be to support a culture of change so that students, faculty, and staff stay home if they don‚Äôt feel well, protecting the health and safety of people on and around the Barnard campus.
* The College has developed a comprehensive set of cleaning protocols, with increased frequency as well as special attention to common areas, high-traffic areas, and bathrooms.
* Barnard is making improvements to air filtration and increasing outside airflow through building systems where possible.¬†
* To prioritize health and wellness for the Barnard and Morningside Heights communities, students, faculty, and staff are expected to acknowledge and adhere to a new community pledge that will detail personal and collective responsibilities for maintaining a safe campus.

**Campus Community & Living**

We know from public health experts that new cases of COVID-19 have the potential to occur whether students are at home, in apartments off-campus, or in the residence halls. De-densifying the residence halls will be important to limit any potential transmission of COVID-19. This, of course, reduces the number of students who can live on campus at any one time. Recognizing how important residential life is for many of our students, our plan ensures that students have the opportunity to live on campus for part of the year while following public health guidelines.¬†

**Fall Semester:** First-years and [eligible](https://alert.barnard.edu/campus-community-living) sophomores will be invited to live on campus and must complete a new [Fall Housing Form](https://barnard.starrezhousing.com/StarRezPortal) by July 20 to indicate whether or not they intend to live on campus.

Entering sophomore transfer students, junior and senior Resident Assistants, Orientation Leaders, students in other leadership roles, and students with extenuating circumstances (e.g., situations that make online learning nearly impossible, students who have academic work that is best conducted on campus in the Fall) may [apply for an exception](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfk00mJ0MQv7HE8I3mA6CTrS4AkTR_tyT3OxGyY9UT-eiadcQ/viewform) to live on campus, though housing is not guaranteed.

**Spring Semester:** [Eligible](https://alert.barnard.edu/campus-community-living) juniors and seniors will be invited to live on campus.

Entering junior transfer students, students in leadership roles, and students with extenuating circumstances (e.g., situations that make online learning nearly impossible, students who have academic work that is best conducted on campus in the Spring) will be given the opportunity to apply for Spring housing. Depending on public health and capacity, we hope to be able to safely accommodate many first-years and sophomores for on-campus spring housing as well.¬†

**Summer Semester:** Students who register for summer classes can apply to live on campus. Our goal is to accommodate all applicants.¬†

Students who wish to live off campus for the upcoming academic year can find resources on the [residential life website](https://barnard.edu/reslife/housing-options/off-campus). Enrolled students who live off campus are welcome to come onto campus daily (if local) ‚Äî whether to attend in-person classes or programs or use Barnard facilities, which will be subject to occupancy limits to ensure public health recommendations around physical distancing. As a one-time exception for this academic year, financial aid recipients who are not invited to live on campus can apply to transfer financial aid off campus if they plan to rent an apartment in the area.

Barnard is implementing a number of changes for students living on campus:

* All students will be assigned to single-occupancy rooms in the residence halls.
* Students will have assigned bathrooms, with drastically reduced density in corridors with shared bathrooms. Bathrooms will be cleaned with increased frequency.¬†
* Residence hall spaces and bathrooms will be set aside for student isolation as needed. Self-isolating students will have access to 24-hour clinicians on call and receive meal deliveries.
* In addition to testing upon arrival, residential students will be required to produce a negative PCR test result in advance of arriving on Barnard‚Äôs campus.
* Dining will be reconfigured to allow for staggered meals in a safe manner, with more grab-and-go options and limits on the size of gatherings.¬†
* Barnard‚Äôs New Student Orientation Program (NSOP) will be a mix of in-person and virtual programming so that students can participate wherever they are.
* Residential move-in will be staggered over several days, and depending on [New York State guidelines](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory), students may be required to quarantine upon arrival.
* Students traveling outside the tri-state area for Thanksgiving will need to check out of their residence halls at that time and finish the semester remotely; these students will be eligible for a prorated credit for room and board, adjusted for financial aid.

Given the unpredictability around the global pandemic, our goal is to be flexible in everything that we do. Our plans are dependent on city, state and federal guidance (including NYC entering Phase 4 of the [governor‚Äôs reopening plan](https://forward.ny.gov/) prior to the start of Fall term). We are prepared to ramp up (or ramp down) activities on campus throughout the year, guided by local conditions. While we see emptying our campus as a last resort, we have plans in place to do so if needed. By de-densifying students in the residence halls and campus more generally, and with an unwavering commitment from the entire community to public health and safety guidelines, our hope is to have a successful and productive academic year.

Finally, as an acknowledgment of the challenging economic times faced by virtually all families, there will be no increase in tuition or the comprehensive fee for the 2020-2021 academic year. And, as [announced](https://alert.barnard.edu/news/financial-decision-making-and-summer) in April, Barnard will cover the summer earnings student contribution for all students who receive need-based Barnard Grant Aid. Room and board will be charged based on the number of semesters a student lives on campus. All students are able to take classes over three semesters, even though they will be charged for only two semesters. Bills and financial aid award letters will be sent out in the next two weeks.¬†

I know you must have many questions. We have developed a [new planning website](http://alert.barnard.edu/roadmap) with detailed information that we will frequently update over the summer. We will also hold virtual meetings in the coming days to address specific details of our planning (registration is not required). Please use [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOvEMiTNfrASZRk_7FFcys-nl1Qd2ui0y18UzDvZ5d5P4EhQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit questions in advance of and during the meetings.

* [Link](https://youtu.be/tVGGxJytVHs) [for Thursday, July 9 at 8 p.m. EDT](https://youtu.be/tVGGxJytVHs)
* [Link](https://youtu.be/KSFxKS4e-AQ) [for Friday, July 10 at 10 a.m. EDT](https://youtu.be/KSFxKS4e-AQ)

There is no doubt that the upcoming academic year will require adaptability and flexibility from each of us. Nonetheless, if we commit to caring for one another, I am confident in our ability to have a truly remarkable year. Bringing our intellectual resources to bear, individually and collectively, on the challenges we face has never been more important. Our students need the extraordinary education Barnard offers to make sense of, take action, and thrive in these troubled times. And the nation and world need the contributions this singular institution will offer in the months, years, and generations to come.¬†

Looking forward to Fall,

clm100,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

It is with immense sadness that I share with you that Peter Awn, Dean Emeritus of the School of General Studies, passed away yesterday from injuries sustained when he was struck by a car last month.

Since his arrival on the Columbia campus more than four decades ago, no one has been a more beloved member of our community than Peter. The grief we feel at his loss is overwhelming.

This heartbreak is especially palpable for the General Studies community where, during his 20-year tenure as Dean, Peter came to personify the School‚Äôs character, its values, and its mission. In every way that mattered, he and the School were one. This unmatched legacy, in addition to his remarkable scholarship and teaching as Professor of Islamic and Comparative Religion, made Peter, without question, one of the essential leaders of Columbia University‚Äôs modern era.

The rare gift he was able to bestow upon generations of General Studies students was his unconditional belief that Columbia was better for their presence and his insistence that they believe this as fervently as he did. Peter recognized that General Studies represented the ‚Äúcutting edge of undergraduate education,‚Äù as he put it, and under his stewardship the School has been able to fulfill its promise. For him, that meant a student body comprised heavily of student veterans, first-generation students, and international students, whose age and life experiences would further diversify and enrich our undergraduate classrooms. It meant, also, establishing partnerships with Sciences Po in Paris, the City University of Hong Kong, and Trinity College Dublin. And it meant embracing both the nation‚Äôs oldest and largest certificate program for individuals holding an undergraduate degree and seeking admission to medical school and the School‚Äôs long-held relationship with the Jewish Theological Seminary.

In the difficult days since Peter was injured he received world-class care from the doctors, nurses, and staff at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. During this time, I have been able to meet several of his family members and friends who loved and admired him so deeply. They have learned over these past few weeks the very special place he holds in the Columbia community. On behalf of the entire University, I extend our deepest condolences to Peter‚Äôs sisters, Claudette Maraziti and Louise Crowley, his many nieces and nephews, and his lifelong friends Norman Laurila and Rob Westerberg.

In the months ahead, we will have opportunities to celebrate Peter‚Äôs extraordinary life and reflect on his many contributions to Columbia. For now, I can only convey this stunningly sad news and ask that‚Äîin the spirit of Peter himself‚Äîwe commit to helping each other as we grieve this enormous loss. Please do not hesitate to seek support from Counseling and Psychological Services, the Office of the University Chaplain, and the Office of University Life.

Peter will always remain in Columbia‚Äôs heart.

Sincerely,

emtrose,"Yeah.
So I started the application in December. At that point I had a job.
It was a very, very difficult job in a fine dining restaurant, but it paid me well enough, and gave me 30 hrs in 3 days.
Now I've been looking for something new. It seems like every restaurant job is now mandating a full-time schedule, 5 days a week.
This is not to mention that I will have to learn a new menu while also learning in Columbia. Before I went to college recently I spent 6 months learning the menu before I went to college. It can be very stressful and it seems that chefs will have endless excuses to fire someone with there being so many unemployed.
Additionally, most are only offering minimum wage.
I applied for multiple casual jobs on campus.
Unfortunately they told me none were available.
I'm looking for a job in other fields, entry level of course, and again, it's very hard to find something part time.
From everyone I have talked to, it's not realistic to work full time while even going part time at GS.
Ideally I would find a job that gives me two days consistently at 18-20 an HR.
Then I would live in a place in Harlem for cheap.
I have looked at a few off campus locations so far and they have mostly been disgusting but affordable in the 600-800 range.
I could afford that but barely.
I was hoping the school would be able to provide some assistance in finding a job, but due to the pandemic it's very hard to get in touch with anyone.
I have to say I'm just deeply disappointed.
Going to this school is a dream.
I hoped that there would be some viable way to do this. I'm considering trying to work full time while taking two classes. To give it a shot at all.
I really wish they offered more assistance. The only thing I can do now is defer and hope by some miracle I find a job willing to meet my requirements.","Accepted into Columbia, realizing it's not realistic to attend",58,0.97,gzpjat,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/gzpjat/accepted_into_columbia_realizing_its_not/,69,1591745996.0,2020-06-09 18:39:56

Sealas,"Long story short, President Bollinger has been dragging his feet accepting the CARES act money allocated to the university. They were waiting for clearer guidance about how to distribute the funds, and that guidance wasn‚Äôt released by the Department of Education until June 17th - almost a fucking month ago.

Teacher‚Äôs College and Barnard have already accepted the money, and have been distributed grants and funds to those eligible. 

I‚Äôve been in contact with the financial aid department and they said it‚Äôs solely up to the President at this point. I‚Äôve emailed his office, twice, to start generating noise about accepting the money. It would be helpful having other people email the President‚Äôs office to put pressure on them to accept the 13million allocated to CU. 

A simple email to his office inquiring about the University‚Äôs plans to accept the money, is the best shot we as students can do to actually get it done. An example could be:

Dear President Bollinger,

My name is:________, and I‚Äôm a student in(CC/SEAS/GS/ETC). After the department of education released their final interim guidance for the CARES Act on June 17th, why hasn‚Äôt the university released any information regarding intent of accepting and distributing the money to needy students? I, like many of my fellow students at CU, have been adversely affected in the mandatory relocation from Spring 2020, but also losing _____ opportunities this summer to contribute to my education. Rejecting those federal funds only makes our community far worse off.

Signed,

______

ivankasta," Here's the email I received this morning:

Dear Students,¬†

As we draw this academic year to a close in an manner that was unthinkable just a few short months ago, we are already looking ahead to the fall‚Äîand the academic year ahead. We‚Äôve been working to develop a range of contingency plans considering everything from technology to physical space; in-person courses to innovative virtual instruction and programming; housing to residential life.¬† While we cannot know for certain how events will unfold, I write today to share some details of our thinking and planning.¬†

* **The safety and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff are of utmost importance.** We are drawing on the expertise of Columbia University‚Äôs leading scientists and public health experts to ensure a safe learning and working environment. Doing so will no doubt require appropriate measures for physical distancing, protective equipment, and other safeguards.¬†
* **We plan to resume instruction in the fall in a hybrid format**, allowing for in-person participation to the extent possible under public health guidelines. We know that every in-person class must include a way for those who cannot teach or attend in person to participate remotely.
* **Fall semester classes for continuing students will resume on Monday, September 14**‚Äînot on September 8 as originally planned. The resumption of full-semester classes will follow one week of Legal Methods I and Introduction to American Law classes for incoming J.D. and LL.M. students, respectively. We are currently developing a revised academic calendar to account for these changes.¬†

Even in these tumultuous times‚Äîindeed, especially in such times‚ÄîColumbia Law School remains firmly anchored by its mission: to prepare the next generation of graduates to be superb lawyers capable of confronting the most challenging issues of our time, to generate new knowledge through the scholarship of our world-renowned faculty, and to draw strength from the deep well of expertise of our distinguished research university in this great city of New York.¬†

I am so very grateful for the ways in which we have come together as a community during this period of disruption and change, and I am heartened by the ingenuity, resilience, and sense of common purpose that you have brought to the challenges we have confronted. We will continue to share updates and information as new developments arise.¬†

With my best wishes,

Gillian Lester

Volition77,"Dear Columbia College students,

I am writing today with an important update to inform you as you plan for the upcoming semester. While the Office of the Registrar had scheduled the next registration period to begin on July 27, we have been informed that the University has decided to postpone the upcoming registration window by a week.

Because of the complexity of spreading the curriculum from two terms to three terms, and more recently, to establishing a range of in-person, hybrid, and online courses, more time is needed to allow the Registrar‚Äôs Office to update course schedules and course modalities on the Directory of Courses. This will allow students to make their plans for the Fall semester with the most updated and accurate information.

Registration will now begin on Monday, August 3, and your registration appointment times in SSOL will be reassigned for the periods of August 3 through August 7, and August 10 through 14. We hope that this additional time will also give you the opportunity to talk with your academic advisers and to let us know what questions you still have about the upcoming semester.

We appreciate your patience, as well as your eagerness to begin the academic year ahead.

Sincerely,

archimon,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

Next week I will be writing with an update on the University‚Äôs plans for the fall semester. Today, I write in response to the Trump administration‚Äôs recently issued proclamation expanding the existing restrictions on immigration to also cover non-immigrants who seek entry into the United States under certain visas‚ÄîH-1B and J-1, specifically. Unfortunately, even tragically, the new restrictions will make it harder for faculty, physicians, and research scholars to enter the United States. This has the potential to cause severe damage to our academic institutions and to the scientific community, in particular. I cannot overstate how strongly I disagree with these new restrictions.

They strike at the heart of how American universities function, at their basic character, and at the principles that have contributed to the enormous advances in knowledge over the past century especially. Our great research universities, like Columbia, are able to contribute to the public good precisely because of the commitment to be part of an international community of scholars and researchers. The search for knowledge transcends national boundaries, and the strengths of our universities depend on tapping into that collective quest. Besides negatively affecting the sense of shared purpose, these changes have very practical adverse consequences for public health, the economy, and general human wellbeing.

According to the American Immigration Council, over the past decade, eight companies that are currently trying to develop a COVID-19 vaccine (Gilead Sciences, GSK, INOVIO Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson‚Äôs pharmaceutical arm, Moderna Therapeutics, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi, and Vir Biotechnology) received approvals for 3,310 biochemists, biophysicists, chemists, and other scientists through the H-1B program. Additionally, the Council points out that an increase in H-1B visas could create an estimated 1.3 million new jobs and add around $158 billion to U.S. GDP by 2045.

These statistics, important but abstract, cannot fully capture the harm caused by the misguided changes in the nation‚Äôs visa policies. There will be very direct and difficult human consequences for members of our institutional family, affecting our international students, researchers, faculty, and staff who daily bring the world to our intellectual doorstep. They are our colleagues, neighbors, and friends. I am certainly committed on Columbia‚Äôs behalf to opposing restrictive immigration policies such as these and to continuing Columbia‚Äôs longstanding efforts to embrace the world, not turn against it, which only weakens us and inhibits the fundamental quest for human understanding.

Sincerely,

Lee C. Bollinger",Fall Plans Will Be Announced Next Week - Bollinger Email on Immigration Restrictions,46,0.94,hk0wjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/hk0wjl/fall_plans_will_be_announced_next_week_bollinger/,10,1593738410.0,2020-07-02 20:06:50

the1795," 

Dear Barnard Students,

We hope this email finds you and your families well. These past few months have been extraordinarily difficult for all of us, in different ways, but we are hopeful for the new semester, for coming together again, and for sharing what will undoubtedly be a historic year at Barnard.¬†¬†

While we‚Äôve communicated to you throughout the summer our plans to reopen the campus to students in a safe way, and about changes to the curriculum and Academic Calendar, we are now finalizing important details about the semester ahead. Collectively, we must keep in mind the purpose of the work we have done over the summer to prepare for the fall ‚Äî that Barnard can offer students an intellectual home and can serve as a laboratory of ideas for engaging critically with the pressing questions and uncertainties of the present moment. As you know from ‚ÄúLaunch Week,‚Äù new courses and curricular content will be devoted to addressing topics such as COVID-19 and both historic and present-day systemic racism. Difficult as it is, this moment offers both an opportunity and a responsibility to make a difference, and we have designed our curriculum to respond to the challenge.

Life on campus will be different in many respects, but much of what we all love about Barnard will remain the same. Innovations in our curriculum, the addition of new faculty and staff, the introduction of new modes of teaching, additions to the First-Year Experience courses, and safety enhancements to our campus and facilities, are a testament to our enduring commitment to all of you. In short, we‚Äôve very much missed you on campus and we can‚Äôt wait for you to return.¬†

Our [website](http://alert.barnard.edu/) contains a great deal of information that you will find helpful as you register for your courses and consider your options for the year ahead. We write to you today to offer guidance that will be especially relevant as you plan your Fall semester.¬†

**A Community Pledge**¬†¬†

Barnard is a special place because we are a community. Caring for each other comes naturally at Barnard, but in these times we must formalize our mutual respect and care. To that end, we are asking all students, faculty, and staff to sign a [Community Pledge](http://alert.barnard.edu/health-safety). With this commitment, we promise to abide by a set of rules for behavior on campus. These include requirements around the wearing of masks in public, hand-washing and sanitation, social distancing, the use of designated spaces at designated times, as well as other behaviors to help promote the well-being of all on campus. Residential students will complete the pledge when they receive their housing assignment later today. Non-residential students will receive an email later in the week directing them to the pledge. We ask you to rise to this challenge with purpose and focus and embrace the responsibility of care.

**Registration Details**

Given changes to the Academic Calendar and the addition of many immersive classes, all Barnard students are required to review their fall class schedule and make changes as needed.¬†

Key dates to keep in mind for registration are as follows:

* For continuing students, registration is August 3 - 14.
* For first-year students, pre-registration is August 11 - 14.
* For continuing and incoming transfer students, registration is August 25 - 27.
* For first-year students, registration for additional classes is September 4 - 5.
* Additional registration for all students is September 8 - 18.

We will be asking for your intentions and preferences to take each class in-person or online. This information will be critical in helping us assess which classes we will be able to prioritize for in-person hybrid instruction given limited space on campus and will be collected for both Barnard and Columbia classes. It is important to note that our facilities will limit the number of in-person classes, even for those living on or near campus. Further instructions on how to link your preferences to your registered classes will be provided in a subsequent message from the registrar this week.

**New York State Quarantine Requirements for Students from Impacted States**

New York State currently requires any person arriving here from one of the states on Governor Cuomo‚Äôs [restricted states list](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-travel-advisory) to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in New York. The governor‚Äôs executive order means that many of you will need to quarantine before moving into assigned College housing or before taking part in on-campus activities. Student leaders who are asked to move into campus housing earlier than August 31 (Resident Assistants, Orientation Leaders, select Global Ambassadors) may complete their quarantine on campus.

Students required to quarantine are responsible for making their own arrangements and will be asked to attest in writing to the fact that they have quarantined for 14 days prior to entering Barnard‚Äôs campus. The College will assist residential students by providing information about recommended area hotels (with negotiated rates). Residential students on financial aid will receive financial assistance to help defray the expenses associated with quarantine, and those not on financial aid with extenuating circumstances who will be quarantining off campus can also apply for assistance from the College. Details on hotels and obtaining financial assistance will be included in the email with housing assignments that will go out later today. Students are also welcome to quarantine in non designated hotels and in other locations in non impacted states, or with family and friends. We advise students and their families to consider what option is best for them.¬†

Although students will quarantine away from campus, the College will have resources available to assist with their quarantine needs, including accessing medical care when needed. More information will be available on [alert.barnard.edu](http://alert.barnard.edu/) closer to August 17, the date we anticipate many students will begin their 14-day quarantine. Throughout the quarantine period, students may also contact [arrivalquarantine@barnard.edu](mailto:arrivalquarantine@barnard.edu) with any questions, and their inquiry will be routed to the appropriate staff.

Please keep in mind that the governor‚Äôs list of restricted states changes frequently. We suggest that you refer to this list before making any travel plans or hotel arrangements, and we recommend that your travel plans remain as flexible as possible.¬†

**Student Move-in and Residential Life**

Campus move-in dates for students will be staggered from **August 31 to September 4**, with a limited number of move-in time slots each day. Only resident students will be permitted to enter the residence halls during move-in. Parents, family members, and friends will not be able to enter residence halls.

All students will be tested for COVID-19 upon their initial arrival to campus. Students will not be permitted to move about campus, and will be asked to remain in their rooms, until a negative test result is received (estimated to be around 48 hours). Boxed meals will be provided during the quarantine period, and activities and programs will be offered.

Residential Life and Housing will email all residential students detailed information later today.

**COVID-19 Testing**¬†¬†¬†

Like residential students, all off-campus and commuting students will be tested by Barnard for initial entry to campus. As part of the College‚Äôs comprehensive surveillance testing program, asymptomatic testing of all students will occur on a regular schedule, currently set for once a week but subject to changing guidelines.¬†¬†

An initial negative PCR test will be required of all students, faculty, and staff in order to have access to campus facilities and activities. More information will be provided about scheduling these tests, which will be available in late August. Faculty and staff will also participate in asymptomatic surveillance testing throughout the Fall semester. Barnard will provide all testing for both initial and surveillance tests at no cost to students, faculty, or staff.

The results of our community testing will be made available to the Barnard community on a weekly basis, including aggregate information on the number of tests and the percentage of positive test results.¬†

**Community Self-Check App**¬†

All students, faculty, and staff will be required to respond daily to several self-check questions to acknowledge that they are feeling well and that they have not knowingly been in contact with anyone who is symptomatic or has tested positive for COVID-19. The self-check app will provide users with a ‚Äúgreen light‚Äù that they may be asked to show when entering campus and will alert them to stay at home when a ‚Äúred light‚Äù appears. More information on this app and how to download it will be available soon.

**Contact Tracing**¬†

Barnard has built a contact tracing program that supports the efforts of the New York City Test & Trace Corps. Using training from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/05/11/free-contact-tracing-course-johns-hopkins/), and working closely with the College‚Äôs Primary Care Health Services and quarantine/isolation team, the College‚Äôs contact tracing team will reach out to Barnard students, faculty, and staff who test positive for COVID-19, as well as those who may have been exposed. Contact tracers will also provide information to help students, faculty, and staff manage their quarantine/isolation periods.

Barnard must notify the New York City Department of Health about positive cases. The New York City Test & Trace Corps will manage contact tracing for anyone outside of the Barnard community who may have come into contact with someone testing positive at Barnard.¬†

**Seasonal Flu Shots**

Students, faculty, and staff on campus will be required to get a seasonal flu shot. In addition to the usual benefits this vaccine provides, limiting our community‚Äôs exposure to the seasonal flu will be an important part of recognizing, managing, and limiting the spread and the health risks of COVID-19. In the coming weeks, we will provide additional details about when and where you can get flu shots on campus.

**Semester Contingency**

All students, whether residential, in New York City, or elsewhere in the country or world,¬† are required to complete a semester contingency plan in the event that the College‚Äôs operations for the Fall semester change. Information from this form helps the College best support students and allows students and families to plan in advance for unexpected situations due to COVID-19 during the Fall 2020 semester. Residential students will complete this form when they receive their housing assignment later today. Non-residential students will receive an email later in the week directing them to the form.¬†

**Restrictions on Travel**¬†

All students, faculty, and staff on campus will be required to follow College guidelines regarding College-sponsored and other travel.¬†¬†

Students will have the option of remaining on campus for Thanksgiving or returning home. Any student traveling outside the tri-state area will be required to move out of their residence hall prior to leaving for Thanksgiving, and room and board will be prorated accordingly.¬†

We understand that this email contains a great deal of complex information. As circumstances change, we will continue to update you. We remind you that important College messages will be posted at [alert.barnard.edu](https://alert.barnard.edu/updates).

NewsFragment,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community,

Having moved through detailed planning by the Education Working Group and having been approved by the University Senate, the contours and character of the 2020-21 academic calendar, attached to this message, now are set.

As President Bollinger announced last month, we will more fully utilize the familiar three-term academic year, not just the customary fall and spring terms but an augmented summer. You will recall that this schedule has been adopted in order to make as much in-person instruction and campus life possible as conditions allow by controlling density, enhancing pedagogical flexibility across different schools and programs, and working to ensure that students‚Äô plans for their education can best proceed. 

With these goals in mind, the calendar has been organized in the following manner:  

1. While the timing for the fall remains similar to previous years, starting the day following Labor Day (September 8), spring and summer terms will take place earlier than usual. Classes for spring 2021 will first meet on January 11; in the summer term on May 3. 
2. Each term will offer the optional possibility of immersive courses by being divided into two equal-length sequential blocks. This arrangement of A and B time frames will provide flexibility to faculty as they develop curricula for specific programs and for students as they select coursework, even as most courses are likely to take the more traditional full-term shape.
3. The earlier start to the spring term will allow a prompter opening for the summer term, thus assisting students who enroll in summer coursework (including those who concentrate their work during ‚Äòsummer A‚Äô) to have the ability to participate in internships, summer employment, and other seasonal activities.
4. Commencement events will take place following the spring term exam period, as is traditional, but earlier than is common, during the last week of April.

While schools may determine how to structure their academic programs, across the University all will adhere to the dates announced in this calendar.

More details‚Äîschool by school, program by program‚Äîwill be forthcoming, but this established structure is the framework within which collective and individual planning for the coming academic year will be proceeding.

Looking forward with anticipation, 

Ira

columbiatsj,"I (18F) currently have what seems to be a recipe for a great freshman year. I live in Carman, go out every weekend, am doing decently in my classes, i‚Äôm part of clubs I enjoy and have plenty of friends and a defined friend group. I would say that I currently have the most amount of friends that I‚Äôve had in my life. Despite all this, I‚Äôm deeply unhappy and lonely.

I feel like all my relationships here are superficial and surface level. Its November and the friend group I have only seems concerned about their high school achievements and I don‚Äôt really care about that anymore. They‚Äôre great people, but I just don‚Äôt click with them and I‚Äôm obviously the only one outside this dynamic.  They‚Äôre much closer to each other than with me and it‚Äôs sad to observe. Outside this group I have plenty of individual friends I get lunch with, study with, or party with, but those friendships are also at the beginning stages. I‚Äôve been here for almost a semester and I miss having friends I can rely on and confide in and be completely myself around. 

I‚Äôve called and finally met with someone at Columbia Health about this but they weren‚Äôt much help. They told me to ‚ÄúBe more social‚Äù, which obviously isn‚Äôt the problem.

uniquelyregion,"I know this isn't a unique feeling, especially not at Columbia, but what I need is advice and perhaps some assurance from people who have been in a similar boat.

At the moment I have a group of people whom I call friends, but my relationship to them feels empty and one-sided. I feel like none of them care about me, or about whether I even exist. If I were to magically disappear none of them would  notice, and even if they did they wouldn't care. Any contact with them has to be initiated by me; I'm not liked enough by any of them to be the one who's messaged first. Sometimes, even when I am the one who speaks first, I'm just ignored and forgotten about. It's the kind of thing where, if I stop contacting any of them, the relationship would probably end because none of them would ever initiate contact. They don't treat each other this way, but it is the way I'm treated. They would never exclude each other from a group event, but my exclusion means nothing to them really. I love them, but they don't seem to love me back.

I haven't felt this way before. In the past I've been lucky to have had friends who valued me, but at this school I've struggled. And right now it feels like I'm at a stage where everyone has already formed their own cliques--like there's no hope of meeting different people who're willing to make room for someone like me.

The typical suggestion is to ""join clubs,"" but it often feels as though people you meet in clubs want the scope of their and your relationship to be limited to interactions within the organization. ""Club friends"" are your ""club friends."" Are there groups on campus where people aren't like this?

I'm sorry if I come off as needy or desperate, but all I want is the feeling of belonging. All I want are friends who value my presence, friends who actually care and who want to be around me.

It is now the moment to focus our attention on how the University will operate in the coming academic year. As you might imagine, no decisions in our history have been taken with more seriousness, care, or rigor than the ones we set forth here and in following correspondence.¬†  


These have been trying times for everyone, albeit in varying degrees. For many, especially our students, lives have been on hold. Dreams have been upended and opportunities seemingly thwarted. It is and will remain our central goal to correct this. Unfortunately, no perfect path lies ahead; there are too many variables outside our control. But we will do everything we can, at every moment, to recapture the rich, intense intellectual life that constitutes our very reason for existence. The COVID-19 pandemic remains a major public health threat, and the challenges we face collectively, as well as individually, are daunting. Today it is time to move forward with what we believe to be the best possible plan for Columbia.¬†  


Academic Life  
As I announced previously, Columbia will operate on a three-term cycle for the [2020-2021 academic year](https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/academic-calendar-2020-21-0). Classes for the fall term will begin on schedule, September 8, but the spring and summer terms will be moved up on the calendar. Classes for spring 2021 will start on January 11 and for the summer term on May 3. Each term will offer the option of immersive courses by being divided into two, equal-length sequential blocks. The first summer term block will end on June 18 in order to allow students time for internships and other work. Commencement exercises will take place at the end of the spring term, during the last week of April.  


Across the University as we enter the fall term, courses will be offered in multiple formats, almost always with an online option, as we restore face-to-face instruction as soon as possible. We are now equipping our classrooms with new technology that will ensure a rich learning experience for students, whether they participate in person or virtually.¬†  


Faculty response to new models of teaching necessitated by the pandemic has been tremendous. We want to support faculty in every way we can. Training has already begun for all instructional modalities. As we move back into a partial in-person educational environment, questions will inevitably arise about who will provide this teaching. It is important, therefore, to say at the outset that the University will not prescribe an approach for individual faculty members. Faculty will have leeway to teach in person, online, or some combination of the two, in consultation with their schools.¬†  


Graduate and professional schools will have flexibility to design their own reopening plans, as they take account of the specific nature of their coursework and student and faculty preferences. It is nothing short of amazing to witness the creativity and thoughtfulness of our deans as they work with their faculties and staff to develop their distinctive approaches to reopening their programs. Each will shortly announce their decisions.¬†  


Thus, all students should expect in the coming days to receive additional information from their schools about the upcoming year. These school-specific messages, along with all related news, will be posted on the [COVID-19 Resource Guide website](https://covid19.columbia.edu/).¬†  


Undergraduate Residential Life  
One of the most intricate aspects of the reopening process has been configuring our residence halls to ensure that they are healthy living spaces. We have determined that we can safely offer on-campus housing to 60 percent of our Columbia College and The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences undergraduate students, who traditionally live in our campus residence halls. Additionally, we will be able to accommodate the same proportion of Columbia School of General Studies undergraduate students in off-campus Columbia residential housing as we have in the past.  


We are committed to offering CC/SEAS undergraduates the option of living on campus for some portion of the academic year. For the fall term, we will invite first-year and second-year students, together with entering transfer students and entering 3-2 Combined Plan Program students who apply for on-campus housing. Students with special or extenuating needs for on-campus resources may apply for an exception to live on campus.  


If, in light of public health conditions, we must continue on the current path of our 60 percent guidelines for CC/SEAS students in residence halls, first- and second-year students would depart campus at the Thanksgiving break, finishing their courses and exams remotely, and third- and fourth-year students would be invited to move into campus residence halls in early January for the spring term. We believe it is especially important for fourth-year students to experience their capstone term in person, if they are able to do so.  


We understand that many undergraduates will be unable to return to campus in person, due to the federal government‚Äôs deeply disturbing visa restrictions, health concerns, or other personal reasons. If first- and second-year student residence hall acceptances do not reach the 60 percent ceiling, additional students will be invited until we have reached our campus housing capacity. As I mentioned previously, we will give additional priority to students in any year who do not have access to the conditions necessary for academic success in their home environments. School deans will be in touch with further information about this commitment.¬†  


Campus Life  
While we will provide flexibility in teaching and scholarship and will seek to provide an on-campus experience to as many undergraduate students as possible, we do have to impose strict guidelines that will apply to all who live, work, study, and teach at Columbia.¬†  


Our recently adopted [campus health policy](https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/enhanced-health-and-safety-policy) will require that persons on campus wear a face covering at all times, unless they are in a private room with the door closed. Physical distancing will be enforced throughout campus, especially in classrooms and residence halls. Many University staff members will remain remote through the fall term‚Äîadditional guidance is forthcoming. All faculty and staff who have returned to campus after some research activities resumed on June 22 have been tested for COVID-19, and each day they are required to complete a symptom self-check. The same requirements will apply to students, and subsequent periodic testing will also be added. A detailed overview of public health protocols on campus is available [here](https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/covid-19-public-health-protocols).  


Finally, all students, faculty, and staff on the Columbia campus will be asked to sign a [compact](https://covid19.columbia.edu/health-compact) that encompasses two-way commitments from the University and its community members. This is an unusual step for us, but it reflects the extraordinary degree to which we are dependent on each other to remain healthy and to maintain any semblance of the university experience we all cherish and are together seeking to restore.¬†  


Please keep in mind that every decision we make related to resuming in-person instruction and residential life will be contingent on New York moving into Phase 4 of its reopening plan. We are required to submit to the State our own detailed reopening plan, demonstrating how we will operate and ensure the health and safety of our campus community and neighborhood. We expect to have final clearance from the State to proceed by the week of August 10. If New York City has not entered Phase 4 by August 15, we will determine if it will be necessary to make changes to our fall term plans.  


As I indicated at the outset, we are all painfully aware of how disruptive and dangerous the virus has been. The costs of the pandemic in human lives lost and unprecedented economic damage have not yet been fully grasped. The effects on our political culture have been profound, and it can fairly be said that we are reeling from the incalculable damage. None of us knows what trajectory the pandemic will take in the months and possibly years ahead, or when communities like ours will reunite in full form.¬†  


I know we all are committed to adjusting to the world as it comes, while holding dear to our purposes and values. Already we can see signs and examples of creativity that will sustain us not only through the crisis, but forever. This is a defining experience especially for the youngest among us, and all the intelligence and dedication we possess will be devoted to guiding them through it.¬†  


In this spirit, let me draw special attention to one group, in particular. We need to find ways to enable the international students who are in the United States to complete their studies here and to expand and deepen opportunities for Columbia‚Äôs large community of international students who cannot come to Columbia because of the pandemic. So, for instance, we are adapting our network of Columbia Global Centers and new Pop-Up Global Center locations to provide in-person academic and peer engagement for many of these students. This will provide a dynamic learning experience in their own or nearby countries and regions.¬†  


We are also trying to teach in the moment and to draw on the extraordinary array of intellectual talent in the University that can help us, and students specifically, interpret and understand the historic effects of the pandemic in the years and decades ahead.¬†  


Columbia College, in partnership with the Columbia Global Centers and Columbia World Projects, has launched the Global Columbia Collaboratory, which will focus on the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. This academic experience is designed to give students‚Äîindeed, all of us‚Äîthe skills, understanding, and ways of thinking that will be needed to lead a world so desperately in search of knowledgeable responses to endlessly complex issues.¬†  


Yet another example: The Columbia School of General Studies is working with the Columbia School of Social Work and the Mailman School of Public Health to develop a co-curricular undergraduate academy, which will begin this fall and will be focused on matters of justice and pandemic preparedness. It will look at communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including many of the neighborhoods surrounding our own campus.¬†  


And, the Columbia Design Challenges, which is offered by Columbia Engineering with partners across the institution, will provide students the chance to see how engineering and applied science together with other disciplines can engage with challenges such as climate change, social justice, and, of course, pandemics.  


Let me close by saying that I know this is and will continue to be an immensely difficult time, most especially for those whom the pandemic has affected directly. I want to take this opportunity to remind you that counselors and specialists are available for students on the [Columbia Morningside](https://health.columbia.edu/content/counseling-and-psychological-service) and [Columbia University Irving Medical Center](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/student-health/mental-health-services) campuses, and for faculty and staff through the University‚Äôs [Employee Assistance Program](https://humanresources.columbia.edu/employee-assistance). [Religious Life](https://religiouslife.columbia.edu/content/contact-us) also offers pastoral counseling. Your deans and other University leaders will provide additional information in the coming days and weeks. I also encourage you to visit the [COVID-19 Resource Guide website](https://covid19.columbia.edu/) to track related news and announcements. And, as always, I promise to be back in touch as developments warrant.¬†

## THE PATH FORWARD

One can only feel a sense of humility in the face of the broad human response as we grapple with a threat as menacing as COVID-19. New York City is almost always the epicenter of crises that strike this nation, and Columbia University in the City of New York is, therefore, too.

Here's what we're doing now to prepare for a safe return to campus.

Affectionate-Goat493,"So this is something that might be far from everyone‚Äôs mind right now, but I‚Äôve just been wondering about it. I eat maybe 95% of my meals in the dining halls alone. And I really don‚Äôt mind eating alone by itself. But I notice that a strong majority of people are eating together. And this makes me feel really bad, actually I cry a lot about it because it makes me feel worthless to have to eat alone while other people are able to consistently find friends who want to eat with them. And it makes me jealous too because I am so much happier when I‚Äôm lucky enough to eat with someone.

So my question is, how is this even possible that so many people eat together at meals? Like do you plan ahead? Do you go with friends from class? Do you run into people at the dining hall? Planning ahead seems like a huge amount of work to do once or twice a day. I sometimes see people I know in the dining hall but it‚Äôs only a few times a semester. And usually if I have friends in a class our lunch schedules don‚Äôt necessarily link up. So logistically I don‚Äôt even understand how this is possible. Please, tell me your secrets :)",Eating Alone at Meals?,36,0.92,hkeo33,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/hkeo33/eating_alone_at_meals/,12,1593789530.0,2020-07-03 10:18:50

However, I j don't know why I'm busting my ass to do engineering when people who take ""easier"" majors like in econ or finance can get through with relatively much healthier lifestyles, a bit less stress, generally higher-earning careers, AND they can still have their hair when they're 50.

mytinycactus,"Second-Year SEAS

Half the time I'm alright. The other half, I think about death constantly. I don't want to kill myself, and I don't think I ever will, but I can't deny how appealing it would be to not exist. Or to die for something that would have me leave a positive impact, instead of being such a drain to the people around me. It's been making me more and more upset lately.

If I told my therapist here how I honestly feel, I would be forced into medical leave. If I told my friends or family, they would just be scared and worried over a situation they can't control. They would try to help in ways that only makes bearing the pain and sharing it with others worse. I am all alone in this. It's consuming me.

I have a hard time socializing with others. I get anxious and quiet at parties. I can't stand the politics and the virtue signalling that seems to be so common around here. Yet I know I have a hard time placing trust in and appreciating people when I first meet them. I recently found my first good friend here, which I'm extremely grateful for. But it doesn't seem to have made a difference.

I'm doing worse and worse in my classes. I just dropped one, but I'm still falling behind in the others. I don't know what to do. I had such a great work ethic and enthusiasm in high school. But since I've arrived at Columbia that's slowly bled away. I'm losing my motivation and passion for the things I wanted to do in life.

I'm in my second year and I don't know how much longer I can carry my weight academically. I have little faith that these classes serve any practical purpose. They seem like a waste of my time. I just want the degree. I don't feel this way when I'm back home, but I don't have to deal with classes when I'm there. I don't see how taking a year off or transferring to another college would help anything. This is a hurdle I will have to get over sometime in my life. Now is that time, if I can make it work. And this really is such a wonderful city and a unique school. I wish I could figure this out.

Sorry to be such a downer. I know there are a lot of nice memes and neat discussions to be had. But I have no where else to turn and I'm starting to get desperate.

notleebollinger,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia server,

In early July, I wrote to announce our plans for how Columbia would operate in the coming academic year in the face of this mighty pandemic. That email, as you now know, was a complete lie. The goal underlying and animating that message remains the same today: to ensure the freshman class made their deposits before we announced our real plan. Between then and now the institution has dedicated every possible minute and resource to keeping up that facade.

In that July letter, I also indicated my need to evaluate the circumstances, and I committed to sharing with you a final assessment by August 15 if New York City was not in phase 4. It is in phase 4, but we ‚Äúre-evaluated‚Äù anyway.  While New York City is a pillar of health, the surges of the big not-so-good hunky pandemic continue to rage through the underbelly of Florida. This, unfortunately, has consequences for us Yankees. 

Though six weeks ago we told you that we could safely house 60 percent of Columbia College and Engineering undergraduates in our residence halls, today we have concluded that we don‚Äôt feel like it anymore.  

While I am supportive of the measures New York State and big papa Cuomo have imposed, and while I have no doubt that we could ensure a safe quarantine period from a public health standpoint, two weeks is a long time to endure isolation. Personally, I cannot stand being alone with the overwhelming pain of existence for even a single minute, which is why I have my servants entertain me by dancing the macarena at all times. Aye macarena indeed.  

Since undergraduate students are not living on campus, we have decided that all undergraduate courses will not be on campus. Since 1754, Columbia has had the physical capacity to conduct many undergraduate courses in person, even through the trying times of the Revolutionary War. We today are facing our own revolution of sorts, but students now will be living in so many locations such as the garbage can outside my mansion that online instruction is the only realistic approach. This means that, no matter where undergraduates spend the fall term, they will have a unanimously inadequate experience. But fortunately, there will still be the chance to hit upon thine juul while some of the finest minds in the world spend 20 minutes trying to turn on a webcam. 

Approximately 40 percent of all graduate courses offered this fall will be hybrid or in-person, including my sweet little seminar on Advanced Issues in the First Amendment in the Law School. In my opinion, the opinion that I have is that Advanced Issues in the First Amendment in the Law School is the most valuable class at the most valuable university in the most valuable city in the world. The First Amendment gives us the right to petition the government with grievances...but luckily for me, Columbia is a private institution, so please direct all feedback to [NielGorsuch@fiji.title9.org](mailto:NielGorsuch@fiji.org). 

That brings me to the last observation. There is every reason to believe that the conditions that we are experiencing now will continue in one form or another, in one degree or another, in one shape or another, for an extended period, or another. Even if one is, as I am inclined to be, optimistic about not being accused of misleading the entire student body for the sake of financial gain, we must be certain that we will be living with a significant degree of uncertainty for many units of time. Although this too is uncertain. Actually, I have no fucking clue what I am talking about. That means many things. I am plentiful. Watch me roar!

We should, accordingly, think of the decision about undergraduates and the fall term as just one part of the larger neoliberal exploitation of the proletariat, of which Columbia too is a part. We need to establish a sense of confidence among us, turn to our experts in public health for guidance, calibrate our peloton bikes, think in terms of what I think is right, and talk‚Äîagain and again through these impossibly long, meandering, and poorly written emails. Finally, as many of our rhythms of intellectual life such as the mambo are disrupted, we must make sure we are experimenting and learning from the vast array of teaching opportunities we will be exploring, along with our sexuality (Jean and I are swingers). 

This is a moment to give our primary focus to not getting sued, and I know I speak on behalf of the entire faculty and staff when I say this is being done. We know your lives are being shaped by this pandemic in ways you never contemplated possible. I never thought I could stand Jean for this many hours, or resist myself around her sexy aerobics leotards. Please know we stand here, ready to help you sign your deposits. And, a final expression of unending gratitude to all sheep within the Columbia community who are still paying me money.

mesientotriste,"Hey guys,

Long post ahead, TL;DR at the bottom.


I‚Äôve been feeling a little worse for wear this midterm season for a couple of reasons and I wanted to know your thoughts / advice on my current situation. 


Basically what‚Äôs been fucking me up most is that I received a bad grade in one class my freshman fall semester and it absolutely destroyed my cumulative GPA. The class was considered rigorous and in a subject (stem) not at all related to my major (humanities-oriented) if that‚Äôs important. I‚Äôm a sophomore in CC currently and I‚Äôm trying really hard in my classes this semester so I can nudge that number a little higher, but it seems hopeless at times because after two semesters I‚Äôm sitting at just below a 3.0. 
Honestly this has been killing my confidence and I haven‚Äôt told a single person except my mom (love you mom) because I‚Äôm just super embarrassed about it. Sometimes, albeit rarely, people will joke with condescension about how they know someone with a 2-point-something GPA and I‚Äôll just be chilling there like *yeah haha that‚Äôs rough hahaha* but on the inside I definitely shrivel a little. 

I‚Äôve been trying to hype myself up through the reassurance that if I get stellar grades for the rest of college I‚Äôll show an ‚Äúupward trend‚Äù which will indicate growth and ability to learn from mistakes. This is actually pretty much what happened in HS for me (got meh grades freshman year and straight A‚Äôs junior year), but from a career / grad school standpoint I can‚Äôt help but stress. I know for certain fields like finance they won‚Äôt even look at your resume if your GPA is below a certain cutoff, but to what extent are there exceptions to this via networking, professional/research experience and the like? And how does this vary among competitive fields? I‚Äôm feeling the same semi-desperation when it comes to grad school, specifically law. 

Coupled with this is the fact that I feel like an absolute retard in 1004 Java compared to the others in the class. I generally haven‚Äôt experienced imposter syndrome since I‚Äôve been here, but it seems like the class is easy for most people while I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding what are pretty abstract concepts defined using a ton of terminology I‚Äôve never heard before. I came into the class knowing literally nothing about computers and it gets hard not to psych yourself out and have spiraling thoughts along the lines of 

*dang seas and stem kids are way smarter than me and a stem degree probably seems way more impressive than a humanities one so I should switch my major to stem to be more eye-catching to employers even if its at the expense of enjoying school* 

... especially since I was pretty good at math and whatnot in HS but I just do not shape up to the level of talent in STEM here.

All in all I definitely just needed to throw a pity party for myself and I‚Äôm usually not this dramatic, but these thoughts are still frequent enough to give me a bit of a hard time if that makes sense.

Fed_Up_CS_Student,"**tl:dr theres a crazy guy on this subreddit spreading hate. Please stop replying to him in any form. Yeah it was funny but hes not worth it. hopefully mods ban this guy. Please dont reply to his future posts.**

&#x200B;

I don't know about other people, but I've had enough of this dude and his insecure whining. The terrifying thing is when you read all the posts and comments together I think he's dead serious and extremely insecure. He unleashed a torrent of discord between all these people and it's never going to stop unless we ban him ASAP.

It's all fun stuff, but at this point this dude's insecurity and tier lists are so stupid and only serve to sow division between the schools. He's literally trying to make the schools hate each other by pretending to be a law student. At one point he literally compared SPS hatred to racism in America. Who the hell does this?

To the people who have fun with this guy: Yes, he is indeed hilariously stupid, but it's not worth it to let someone like this have a voice. **I worry this guy makes SPS students feel attacked who just want to be in peace and have an education. To these SPS students, please know I personally do not look down on any of you for going to SPS. I honestly think the hatred towards the school is mostly focused at this guy and others trying to talk shit, but there are dicks out there who will be shitty to people based on their school. Not everyone will be like this I promise.**

SPS dude I know you are going to reply to this as the other CLS account saying ""What i'm not that Icy guy and fuck you for saying he should be banned for speaking the truth"", but please know you are probably going to reinforce a belief that you should be banned. You are objectively mentally ill. Please go to a mental health professional tell them all the stuff you said here on this reddit and expect the words to be hard to hear. I'm very serious. I don't pity narcissists like you in the slightest, but for everyone else's sake just get some help. You are a sad person with the mindset of a high school student raging at a video game they lost.

Everyone knows he's going to come on here again and the sad truth is he will actually try to actively dissuade impressionable people into avoiding other schools and hurting their reputation with new accounts, but if he shows up again just call him out and warn people away from his post.

For anyone whos confused as fuck about what I'm talking about see all this bullshit here:

Last thing: It's perfectly okay to argue that your school may be treated unfairly and a lot of the people against SPS may want to ease up a little on some posts. Yeah I get you are speaking about the school and probably not the people, but maybe ease up anyway. But people...... don't act crazy if someone doubts a departments prestige, regardless of school (assuming they aren't an asshole). I feel like alot of people on this subreddit worry too much whether their school is considered to still be in the elite echelon of Columbia. Chill. Be objective. Don't be assholes (but maybe if the person you respond to is clearly an asshole feel free to throw a jab in lol). Have fun.

1. Can a single PhD student live a decent life in NYC with a USD 40,000 stipend? Will I have to look for extra income to supplement this? Will there be leisure money left for me after all the necessities?   
2. In general, are Columbia PhD students competitive or friendly?   
3. Are there opportunities to interact with other grad students outside my department?   
4. If you are a PhD student, are you happy being at Columbia? What Columbia-specific thing do you wish you'd known before choosing Columbia?   
5. Do you like living in NYC? How often do you get to explore NYC for leisure?

pineapple_cai,"TA tips on Zoom?

Hey! This semester I‚Äôm TAing for an intro STEM course, and I need some tips on how to do this online. Typically during lecture, I would be sitting in the back listening and making sure students aren‚Äôt on their phones, etc. This year, however, the professor is going to be using breakout rooms a lot on Zoom and have students work with each other to solve some problems. Every time, I have to circulate around each room and see if anyone needs help. The problem is that the breakout sessions can last a bit too long (~25 minutes), and with only 5 groups and no one having any questions, it quickly gets really awkward for both me and the students, and I end up sitting and staring at the screen in silence for a couple minutes before moving on to the next group. I want to know how to make this less awkward since as a student, it definitely feels a little weird when the prof suddenly pops into the breakout room and watches you talk.

i'm an incoming first-year aiming for premed (possibly neuroscience as a major) and just had a BUNCH of questions (sorry for how many there are, lol!) if anyone doesn't mind answering them?

is it best to have classes back-to-back or more spread out? how do you guys like taking notes?

what classes would you recommend for taking first and second semester? and is it possible to start foreign language 2nd semester of freshman year, as opposed to immediately 1st semester as recommended? for gen chem and calc I , what prof do you recommend?

do you think it would be feasible to do a pre-med track WHILE pursuing both a neuroscience major and another concentration (i'm looking into human rights)?

how do you go about finding research opportunities on campus, and when (in terms of semesters) do you recommend for aspiring pre-meds to start research?

this is more-so open for everyone to answer but around how many clubs do students find themselves taking at once? i have my eye on 3 to 4 that i find interesting, alongside work study, but does this seem like i'm taking on too much at once? i'd still want some free time to myself haha

Columbia_University,"Butler Library is great. But sometimes you need more than the average student does when studying. Here are some tricks/tips:

‚Ä¢Butler is a 24/7 library, but [some rooms](http://library.columbia.edu/content/dam/libraryweb/locations/butler/Guide_Butler_Study_Spaces.pdf) are not.
 
‚Ä¢You can get into most of these rooms when they are not open by [carding](http://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Door-with-a-Credit-Card) the door.

‚Ä¢This includes Butler 601, 502, and the stacks. The stacks are accessible through the 9th floor (take the elevator to 6, stairs to 9). Once there, simply card the door in the middle of the long hallway. This will save many a student cramming essays, if locked out.

‚Ä¢The 9th floor of Butler also has kickass personal bathrooms which are never gross.

‚Ä¢7th floor of the stacks has double doors next to the computer that lead into a vent room from which you can see (and creep out) people on the third floor of Butler. Simply pull both doors at once.

‚Ä¢The group study spaces on the 4th floor have mostly been replaced by ""Group Party Rooms"", which are not allowed to be reserved, according to the signs. People may still [reserve them](https://roomreservations.cul.columbia.edu/), but if someone tries to evict you, simply point to the sign.

‚Ä¢Do not study in 209. Butler 209 is strictly reserved for socializing among Columbia socialites. The lighting is too dark, anyway. If you need to study, study in 403, or better yet, a group party room.

‚Ä¢If you truly hate yourself and want to make your studying as miserable and secluded as possible, consider the graduate student cubicles on the 8th floor, which are never completely full due to their soul-sucking nature.

‚Ä¢If you ever make it down to the 1st floor of the stacks, there is a large comic book stash on one of the shelves. Feel free to read all of them.

‚Ä¢It is possible to get on the roof through a window in 601. This is not the main roof but a good view nonetheless.

‚Ä¢The main roof is accessible through a staircase; you need a really skinny friend to climb around an enclosure and open the door.

‚Ä¢There are few things more satisfying than sliding down the stair railings from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor.

bluebreeze-,"1. Considering a few reasons, including that a more than significant percentage of the international students won‚Äôt rejoin because of travel restrictions in their country, visa problems, etc. 

2. Also the fact that there are students who are immunocompromised or solely don‚Äôt want to go back out of fear for a resurgence in COVID. 

3. Lastly, given the fact that Columbia will 99% give all students the option on whether to study on-site or online, it won‚Äôt make sense economically for another portion of students to pay over $5k in housing fees for one semester + food + other random Columbia student life fees. 

The remaining portion of students is quite small. Surely there will be students that will feel comfortable enough to go back and want to enjoy online classes, but to satisfy those students needs- there certainly wouldn‚Äôt need to be 3 semesters?

I don't get how people say it's ""easy"", let alone get As. I've struggled to get B+s. I hear this SO often around EVERYONE. And they all do better than me, even if I emulate how successful people study. Even my core classes have been super harsh. I got a 92 in CC both semesters but that was a B+ for my class. I showed my writing to many people and they all said it was A material not B+ work.

This past semester, I took some mid-level math classes my major suggests and did really poorly in them. Like B-/C+. The C+ had no curve. I literally studied my ass off. Every day. I asked for advice. I did every study method suggested. I did EVERY practice problem in the course and rewrote all my notes. I had a B+ in these courses until bombing the finals. Everyone else said it was a ""joke"".

The only way to recover is to get As in harder courses, but I really think that's unlikely for me. I feel like my dreams are completely dashed because now I'm not getting into any grad program.

Wokyourworld,"Hi,

I was recently accepted as a transfer to Columbia and Yale! I spent the past year on a leave of absence from my college pursuing my professional acting and recorded music careers, which have both made me happier than I've ever been. I decided to transfer from my previous institution because there was no artistic community / available courses in acting/playwriting/recorded music, and it was too far away from LA auditions (2-2.5 hours 1 way). I have way more friends and am more acquainted with Columbia (I'm from NYC) and am now tasked with the difficult decision between the two. At Columbia, I could feasibly still audition regularly. However, would I not get as good of an on campus arts/theater/recorded music community than at Yale? Are the connections to the music/theater/film industries stronger at Yale than Columbia? Additionally, I've heard little about people at Columbia pursuing a career in recorded (pop) music. Is there a community of non-classical musicians/producers on campus?  Any advice is appreciated!!

emtrose,"I wrote this letter to disabilities.

I was just a bit upset with things. My advisor told me that much of the challenge I brought up to him reflects a design of Columbia.

Now I'm a bit paranoid about what is necessary so far as obstacles and what is not.

&#x200B;

This is what I wrote,""

&#x200B;

This is not a problem I am bringing up with your service.

I have just had an absolutely terrible time with getting set up with the school.

I feel almost as if I have been communicating in morse rather than e-mail.

Initially I gave special consideration to the unique circumstances, but at this point, only a month from the start of the semester, I have to say I am deeply disappointed with how thoroughly unprepared I feel.

From the outset, I had to send countless e-mails back and forth, in addition to phonecalls, appts, with columbia admissions just to get basic information . The majority of information I gleaned came from manual navigation.¬†

With out any sort of correspondence much of the information was not concretely confirmed as relevant.

At this point I have many questions pertaining to what I should need to know.

It has been suggested that I take note of each issue and present it to my advisor during our very short appt. of 30 minutes.

The time limit means I will invariably be surprised by questions I did not get to get to ask due to priorititizing.

The process of registration for classed for an incoming student is dreadful. I did not know when to begin registration. I was not communicated the need for urgency.

Now I am registered in classes that do not work favorably with my schedule.

Additionally, there were multiple classes that explicitly asked first time students not to apply.

This is not at all welcoming.

It has been suggested by an advisor that part of this is by design, suggested as part of the challenges of attending Columbia. A sort of progressive overload.

I suspect that rather than adjusting to the circumstances the onus of responsibility to offset the lack of present faculty on campus has been placed upon the students as the challenges of attending Columbia.

This is entirely unfair as we also are navigating sickness, loss of work, etc.

We see in the The Working Poor by David Shipler who the imposition of red tape primarily affects, and it is not those with the luxury of time.

The whole partial online fall semester speaks ultimately to the commodification of the student body.

The implication that student health is secondary concern to the desire to learn demonstrates coercion of free will, a suggestion of choice.

I just wanted to communicate this to whoever will be my disability advisor to show where I am at with the process.

Thank you.""

ViccyW,"International student from Europe here. I'm a junior and was approved by housing to go back to campus, but I am not sure if I should. Covid is under control in my home country, and apart from having to wear masks in shops, public transit etc., life is pretty much back to normal here. I miss campus a lot though, and I just can't see myself doing another online semester from home. My family's home is getting way too crowded, and there's no way I'll be able to handle studying during a regular Columbia semester with all the constant interruptions here. I'm only preparing for internship interviews right now and I can barely get a few calm hours just for myself every week (imagine that during midterm season). This means that if I stay in my home country, I'd have to rent my own place somewhere in order to be able to study. 

I don't come from a rich family though and the 4000$/semester that Columbia gives us wouldn't be enough to afford rent, a working internet connection and food by myself. Columbia would probably pay for all of that if I came back to campus, but the situation in the US really seems to be too unstable. On the news scientists say a lot that they expect a second big wave in fall (in every country, not just in the US obviously), and I just don't want to be in the same situation again as I was in March, when borders were closing down and I had to worry about not even being able to get a flight back home ‚Äì¬†all during midterm season. In addition, I only have Columbia's health insurance in the US, so I have no clue if they even cover anything covid-related. From my experiences so far, it was already super complicated to find a dentist they would cover to help me with a wisdom teeth that hurt (and then in the end it turned out they don't cover dental surgery so I had to wait until winter break to get the surgery back home). I'm also worried that even if I don't get covid, I might get a different illness / injury and then what happens if all the hospitals in NYC are swamped with covid patients again, and I'm super limited by Columbia's insurance regarding which doctors I can visit and might not get the help I need.

I'm torn whether to go to campus mainly because of financial reasons but risk my health and well-being (and live in a potential lockdown again once the covid fall wave hits), or whether to stay at home where it'll be much safer (even in fall), but sacrifice the performance in my classes because let's face it, 4000$ / semester are just not enough to get my own place where I could study remotely in peace. I also thought about TAing or getting a job at home, but then I'd have less time to study obviously. 

I'd love to hear what other international students plan on doing in fall and why. Did you find a way to afford off-campus on finaid? Will you go back to campus?

shakeyjakethomas,"I was accepted at the university's M.F.A. for creative writing. Flattered to have been accepted, but scared shitless at the cost. Both the cost of tuition and cost of living. I would love to visit the campus and chat with current candidates, but I can't due to coronavirus. So here are my broad questions:  

1. Any M.F.A. alumni out there who can comment on getting hired somewhere (teaching college) after the program? 
2. Do grad students live in the dorms? What's that like? I'm old. 
3. Can anyone with experience comment on the atmosphere of the program and/or workshops?

mathguynumberone,"What are some possibilities of ""new ways of opening""?

&#x200B;

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:  


I am writing with another update, this time primarily to begin thinking ahead to the next academic year. Under the extraordinary and painful conditions of the pandemic, our minds are, by necessity, fixed on coping with the present. But, by inclination and by the sheer march of time, we also have to make plans for the future. We have collectively done so for this semester, and then for the summer, and now we need to bring our attention to the fall semester and next academic year. The purpose of this message is to say that this process is now underway.  


It is true that in a crisis, such as the one we are now experiencing, the almost incomprehensible variables and uncertainties that characterize the moment often make definitive decisions unwise. That said, I want to affirm that Columbia will be proceeding with the 2020-2021 academic year. Over the next two months, I and others will write with more detail about how we will do that. I have no doubt, however, that whatever form our pursuit and application of knowledge takes we will be called upon to manifest a steady and determined effort and to achieve the highest levels of creativity we can summon. We are open, but we are and will be open in new ways, including those we have not yet discovered. Some of what we will do will be new but will change back when normality returns, and for good reason, because these activities and practices have been developed and refined over centuries. I‚Äôm thinking here especially of the art of personal intellectual discussion. Other things, however, we will invent afresh, and keep, and the Columbia decades from now will be richer for them. You will hear from me soon about ideas that are emerging.  


Columbia is many parts. The colleges, schools, departments, institutes, and centers each will have somewhat different plans for the future given the different impacts of the circumstances in which they find themselves. Our central challenge, however, will be accommodating the undergraduate residential system in a period of ongoing risk resulting from COVID-19. Needless to say, we want everyone back just as soon as that can be accomplished with the level of safety we insist upon. As I indicated, we will know much more in the next several weeks. In the meantime, I have asked Ira Katznelson and Dr. Lee Goldman to expand our COVID-19 Task Force, which has been the bedrock of recommendations for the University in confronting the crisis, to have subcommittees address large issues of research, education, facilities, finances, and campus life. These groups are formed and will begin reporting back soon. I want to express our shared gratitude to the members of the administration and faculty who are literally devoting themselves to these institutional issues.¬†  


Just one more thing. I try in these notes to add something about what the University is doing so that we can all have a fuller sense of pride in Columbia. I‚Äôd like to speak about our nearby communities. We are trying our best to help those closest to us in these dire moments. Our faculty are lending their expertise on public health and other urgent issues through a local media partnership with the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. And our Columbia-Harlem Small Business Development Center (SBDC), which is connected to Columbia Business School, is helping hundreds of local enterprises to secure emergency federal loans. We have also offered two months in rent abatement for our small-business tenants, and we are preparing to launch a loan program, in partnership with the SBDC and the Business School, to help local shops, restaurants, and other small firms to reopen.  
   
I would like to close by saying that, while the virus continues to have its devastating effects on the lives of everyone, our medical and public health experts confirm that our policies and practices in New York City, the State, and the nation (as well as around the globe) are working, as witnessed in our own Medical Center, to reduce the escalation of severe illness to levels from which we can begin to bring our world back into some order. Especially for these individual acts of personal responsibility, we can also feel pride and hope for the future. For this, I am forever grateful.  


Again, from the President‚Äôs House, Jean and I send our warmest wishes.

GrowthMagnified,"Hey everyone, today I want to give all of you a strategy that helped me and my students overcome procrastination. (This is what I learned from my time at Columbia and just wanted to share it here to help all of you). As students a huge problem that comes up again and again is procrastination. We know we should be studying and getting our work done but it seems like we just can't get ourselves to do it. Instead, we find ourselves watching Netflix, or scrolling through social media. Even when we do our work, our mind wanders and it seems that the material we are studying is so boring that we would rather spend our time doing anything else because this is our professor's version of torture. I'm here to say it doesn't have to be this way. There are ways around procrastination but the first step is setting our expectations high and realizing what it will take to get there. Every semester, we set our sights on getting straight-A's and dominating our classes but every time we start strong and then fall into our same ways. We have to have counter measures for when those rough times hit. When we set our expectations we also have to set the expectation of how much work that will require. If we want straight-A's, we have to put in A level effort in every single one of our classes throughout the entire semester. Once we have that expectation that we need to put in A level effort we have to realize that there will be times, especially if we are just starting out, when we don't want to put in the work and we want to watch Netflix instead. Straight-A students know that these moments will occur and they understand that in those moments, despite how they are feeling they will take action. There is a great quote about this, ""Don't wait for your feelings to change to take action. Take the actions and your feelings will change."" This is exactly what we need to focus on. No matter how we are feeling, no matter our emotions, take that consistent action and once we start seeing the results, once we start dominating our classes and getting straight-A's our feelings will have completely changed and our success will be a habit.

This is the key note I want all of us to take away from this. Our success starts with raising our expectations and understanding the amount of effort it will take. Our success starts with consistent hard work. Once we have the habit of putting in hard work consistently, we will already be seeing results, and from there we can focus on working smarter by developing better study strategies such as time-management and active studying. The main thing that changed my expectations and my mindset around this was through mentorship with people that are where I wanted to be, and in addition to that, getting around students in my classes that were already dominating, we are the average of the 5 people we are around. I hope this helps and shifts some of your mindsets into complete domination of your courses.",Strategy For Overcoming Procrastination,24,0.84,ckuk71,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/ckuk71/strategy_for_overcoming_procrastination/,1,1564723448.0,2019-08-02 00:24:08

clover-ly,"From presbo:

Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

Anyone who has spent a long career in academia knows firsthand that fields, disciplines, and subjects evolve and change, as new opportunities for knowledge are revealed, as new people come into the academy, and as new generations of students enter the scene. Today, I am writing to share a profoundly important new chapter for Columbia University, in a field that deserves the scholarly brilliance and creativity that only we as a University can deploy.

At their core, all universities are public institutions, in the sense that we are created by public favor to enhance human understanding, educate our youth, and convert knowledge into public good. The genius underlying all of this is rooted in strong scholarly values that are reinforced daily, within the uniquely dynamic intellectual communities that universities represent. As scholars, we are inherently independent-minded, reflective, and committed to sustained and deep inquiry no matter the time frame.

But our legitimacy and, frankly, our intellectual energy derive from being more or less aligned with the world‚Äôs problems and needs. We are not free to ignore the issues of our age and pursue whatever we want. We are ultimately responsible to our societies and the world. To that end, we must answer the call to serve. And when necessary, we must evolve and change.  

At the beginning of the last academic year, I appointed a Task Force, led by Earth Institute Director Alex Halliday, to explore what more the University should be doing with respect to climate change. The fundamental question was, and is, whether the scale of our efforts (within our University and universities generally) in this area of massive human concern, is sufficient to meet the existential dimensions of the problem. In other words, as I wrote then, ‚ÄúAre we marshaling our academic resources in ways that are proportionate to the magnitude and gravity of the challenges civilization will face?‚Äù 

In addition, concretely, would our efforts be significantly enhanced by the creation of a school devoted to these matters? The answer of the Task Force to that question was yes, as is mine, and as was the unanimous vote of the University Trustees at our recent June meeting. It is my honor, therefore, to announce that Columbia is establishing the Columbia Climate School, the first new school in 25 years at the University, and an institution that I have every expectation will be the most important climate school in the United States.

The creation of a new school is an exceedingly rare and significant event at this or any university. The ability to hire faculty, to create a student body and grant degrees, and to nurture a strong community of intellectual collegiality inhering in the pursuit of a particular knowledge base is especially empowering in the academic universe. How this new School will evolve remains to be determined. However, we are hardly starting from scratch. Columbia is already at the forefront of academic discovery and involvement in the issues of climate and society.

The School, at least at the outset, will be somewhat unconventional in its structure, building capacity from a hub of existing, world-class research centers and programs, including the Earth Institute and its many centers: the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), the Center for Climate Systems Research (CCSR), Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), and more. Additionally, even at the present moment, virtually every school and many departments within the University from the arts and humanities to medicine and engineering, already support work in the field of climate. The new Columbia Climate School will be able to draw upon and reciprocate support for those efforts. It will, therefore, work in partnership with the deans and faculties of other schools throughout the institution. It is also notable that the School will be able to utilize the capacities we have created to be truly global in character and focus, especially with the vibrant Columbia Global Centers, and to bridge the world of scholarly endeavor with that of action and implementation, especially with the burgeoning Columbia World Projects and the other components of what we are calling the University‚Äôs Fourth Purpose‚Äîour mission of being more present at the intersection of knowledge and change.   

Inevitably, given the breadth of the phenomena, impacts, and human experiences associated with climate change, the School will figure out areas of special concentration. There already is a rich roster of strategic capabilities, with fields of expertise for which Columbia is currently recognized as the world leader (e.g., climate modeling and forecasting), and others that we will seek to develop further (e.g., food security). We recognize, of course, that climate change is not simply a physical problem but rather one raising a host of societal issues, most notably those encompassed by the principles of social justice. The School will open our eyes to the fact that the accelerating damage caused by climate change is likely disproportionately to affect vulnerable populations in regions at heightened risk of diminishing benefits of health and life. 

With the Columbia Climate School, we are moving to take on in a scholarly way‚Äîas only a great university can‚Äîan area of tremendous public attention and increasing concern, as enduring as anything else we might conceive of. Like the problem itself, this effort may seem daunting, but it is most certainly a moment for institutional pride.

Sincerely,

Here is the dilemma: I applied to both USC and Columbia. I‚Äôm from California and USC is significantly closer to home. But they haven‚Äôt released decisions yet, but Columbia has. Due to the corona virus, Columbia has sent me an email suggesting I should enroll into the mandatory University studies course for summer semester online. I‚Äôm assuming that means that I should send in my acceptance of enrollment letter and my tuition deposit, but summer semester is starting soon and USC‚Äôs decisions haven‚Äôt come out yet. I‚Äôm not sure if I should just forget about USC at this point and go to Columbia.

realfrequency,"I just got accepted to Columbia as an early decision applicant, but the financial aid package that I‚Äôve received severely threatens my ability to attend. 

Context: My parents are divorced, and I live with my mother more than 50% of the time. In cooperation with Columbia‚Äôs financial aid procedure, my mother filled out the FAFSA and my father filled out the CSS Non-Custodial Parent Profile. My mother made it clear from the beginning that she isn‚Äôt able to pay anything for my college education. She completed the FAFSA in hopes that we would qualify for grants. 

Due to my father‚Äôs income, Columbia did not give us any sort of aid, meaning that my dad and I would have to pay the full $80,000 per year. The problem is that, despite his income on paper, my father isn‚Äôt by any means capable of paying that kind of money. He financially supports his unemployed wife, my brother who is also in college, his mother, my mother, and his extended family. My father may be the most affluent person in my family, but we do not have generational wealth. He has people to take care of and bills to pay, not to mention that he is old and thinking about retirement. 

My question to y‚Äôall is, is there any possibility of me qualifying for aid? I haven‚Äôt formally appealed my financial aid package, and to be completely transparent, I‚Äôm ignorant to the logistics of the process. Is my situation even legitimate in the eyes of Columbia? 

ANY ideas, suggestions, or explanations would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask clarification questions as well. Columbia is my dream school and somehow I got accepted. The possibility that my ideal college experience may be inaccessible due to an inaccurate assessment of my financial circumstances is troubling. I sincerely thank y‚Äôall for reading this terribly long post. At this point, my back is against the wall.

Temporary098,"To start, I would just like to say that I'm not some clouty f-boy picking schools based on ""prestige"" or brands value. This is a legit question.

I come from a town full of pretty aimless people, so when I got my college acceptances I was immediately inundated with stupid comments. I eventually narrowed down my decision to Stanford and Columbia, but that's only because my dad wanted me to go to Stanford. The decision was easy for me. If you could take my personality and put it in school-form I don't think there could be a closer match than Columbia. I simply didn't think stanford was a place I could see myself living, let alone enjoy learning at.

Anyway, when I told people I picked Columbia the reaction was either ""oh cool so you're going to South Carolina?"" (I live on the border of Ga and SC in Georgia. Columbia is a pretty big city in South Carolina so I guess I could understand the confusion there), ""Oh where/what is that?"", and the worst one ""bro you're stupid for not picking Stanford"" (coming from a guy who is going to Savannah state but whatever). 

 It seems like people never consider how well you would fit in at a school before they start making judgements. I always have to tell them it is an ivy for it to register with them. But I don't really care about anyone's opinions, I know I'm coming to the perfect school for me. 

The word ""Columbia"" is used so commonly, with clothing companies, tons of cities, roads, counties, and even a homophonous country bearing the same name so I understand the name isn't as ear catching as somewhere like Dartmouth or Yale. 
I would just like to hear about other peoples experiences when telling people where they go/went. How well known and respected is Columbia?

ChemistFromTheD,"Where I live now, cooking at home is a much cheaper option. However, the grocery stores' (Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Fairway) prices I have seen in NYC seem to indicate that buying groceries might be similar in cost to eating out.

Thay might become remarkably inconvenient and cost me too much time.

Datathons are a new type of live-action competition for data-driven, analytically minded students. They are analogous to ""Hackathons"" for software engineers, but instead of building apps, contestants use real-world data to develop and substantiate solutions to a socially impactful problem. If you are curious to see what a Datathon looks like, we encourage you to check out these videos¬†from our past events:

The East Coast Datathon is hosted by Citadel LLC & Citadel Securities in partnership with Correlation One. The event will take place on Saturday, February 23rd from 8:00am - 6:00pm at Princeton. Please note that **we will cover the cost of travel and overnight accommodation** for invited Columbia students traveling to the event.

**Highlights include:**

* **$25,000 in cash prizes!**
* **The chance to showcase your skills tackling a meaningful, real-world problem!**
* **The opportunity to represent your university against other top-tier schools in the¬†Data Open Championship at the New York Stock Exchange and win $100,000 in cash prizes!**
* **Possible interviews with Citadel & Citadel Securities!**

jacyf02,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:

I write today from our Morningside Heights campus, which now has an eerie and uncharacteristic stillness about it, with three purposes. The first is to express my deepest appreciation to everyone for the extraordinary actions taken over these past two weeks to transform the University in ways that will allow us, as much as possible, to continue our work while we, the nation, and the world confront the unprecedented threat of the virus known as COVID-19. I am in awe of the students‚Äîand the staff, parents, and friends who supported them‚Äîwho moved out of the residence halls these last few days, not just for the orderly ways in which it was carried out but for the spirit of citizenship and shared sacrifice that defined it. You heeded the call and showed that there is still, indeed, life in the commons. To those students who have needed to remain due to exceptional circumstances, I want to reassure you that we will continue to provide essential services even with the announcement today from the governor to further reduce our workforce.¬†

The second purpose for this message is to say that, with the exception of clinical education, I am postponing all instruction for the first three days of next week in order to give everyone a little more time to prepare to resume classes for the final few weeks of the semester. Classes will continue virtually on Thursday, March 26th. And, further, with respect to courses, working with each of your schools, we have decided that all classes this semester will be graded pass/fail. This, of course, does not reflect a reduction in expectations, but rather an acknowledgment of the severe complications of this unusual moment.¬†

The third purpose is heartbreaking. Given life as it now is, we cannot go forward with Commencement ceremonies on May 20th, as planned. And, unfortunately, we are not in a position at this moment to announce an alternative plan. The situation is too uncertain, and any plans made now run a high risk of having to be abandoned as circumstances change. But this I can assure you: I will confer degrees on May 20th. We are and will continue thinking about this every day, and we will have a plan to honor and celebrate your successes. Speaking personally, there is no academic ceremony I love more, and I expect to love this one the most.¬†

The world has moved on to a different plane, one none of us could have anticipated a short while ago. I want to say, on behalf of all of Columbia, that we are, as always, ready to do our part, which, given the assembled talent and public spiritedness of this community, is never inconsiderable. While a stillness pervades Morningside Heights, that does not mean our work has abated. Meanwhile, a very different atmosphere characterizes our medical campus in Washington Heights, where our colleagues are girding to face the fraught and daunting challenges to come. Indeed, the outpouring of time, effort, commitment, and personal sacrifice of those serving on the front line of the CUIMC campus are already very palpable. This dedication also portrays the work of all employees essential to keeping the University in operation. My deepest thanks to everyone.¬†

I know it's somewhat frowned upon to look for easy-A classes at Columbia, but I think that students deserve to know as much about the classes they are taking as possible.

I built a website www.ezacu.com that lets students look at A-ranges for courses at CU, and also has a feature to find the easiest classes to satisfy a requirement. This is an improvement over the old gradesatcu.com b/c I organized the data to prevent duplicates and redundancies. If you guys care and/or are interested, please have a look!

JALsnipe,"I hope I'm not stepping on tricolon's or TBOIOMATb's toes by making this post, but I figured since we're all down I'd take it upon myself to make an informational post about this meetup in the works.

So we're all in agreement on Friday right?  Good, because I can't change the title.

How about we all meet up at the Sundial at say, 9PM?  I don't know when you guys usually like to drink.  We could always do later, what do you think?  Depending on the ID situation I guess we should hit up the Abby since they're pretty lax on carding.  It might be a problem if we have a lot of people, since some of the tables at the Abby are small and having gone there with a big party before I'm not sure they really like it.  It also might be pretty crowded on a Friday night.  Alternatively, if someone on EC wants to host that would workout as well.  I would host but I live in shitty JTS housing and my room is tiny.

As always I'm open to comments or suggestions.  I don't know about you guys but I'm pretty excited to make this happen.  Let's do it!

Current ""Shit to Do"" List:

-Figure out where we're going to meet: EC, someone's suit/apartment, etc.

-Figure out a time - does 9PM work for everyone?

-Figure out the booze situation - is everyone ok with bringing a 6-pack or a bottle of something?

---

Ok, even though we still don't have a place to hang out in I'll still be waiting by the sundial at 9PM tonight.  I'll be wearing a red winter coat and a hat with earflaps.  I'm a big guy so it will probably be hard to miss me.

thejordanrivers,"[https://www.college.columbia.edu/fall-2020-faqs](https://www.college.columbia.edu/fall-2020-faqs)

Note that summer housing will not fall under financial aid, making taking summer classes in person just as prohibitive for low-income students as it always has been.

Note how there was no information about waiving the work contribution requirement for the year, making it possible Columbia will still be expecting students to pay 2000-3000+ from money made from any jobs they can find during a pandemic/ depression while at home in a state possibly with a minimum wage of 7.25/hr (assuming they are even in the US). 

Note how there is no information about the value of the new living credit.

Note how there is no guarentee of students being able to return to campus from unstable living populations, just a form to fill out (this one, is admittedly largely outside of Columbia's control, but will the living credit be enough to support students who need to move to off-campus housing for a stable school environment?)

I'm just really annoyed about Columbia treating its significant financial aid students/FGLI students as second-class. I am understanding of the difficulties in creating these plans, but there seems to have been a complete lack of thought given about financial aid at almost every step of the way.

JCKA44,"Dear Students,¬†

  
This¬†**email contains important information**¬†for this coming week. As President Bollinger informed you, in light of new developments related to COVID-19, classes are suspended on Monday and Tuesday, March 9-10,¬†as we prepare to move¬†to an online format for instruction for the rest of this week.¬†**Please read to the end of this message.**  


This new development is based on an abundance of caution. As President Bollinger noted, we do not have a confirmed case of the virus on campus. A member of the Columbia community is in self-quarantine on campus as a result of exposure to COVID-19. This individual is well and is receiving appropriate support, consistent with guidance from the New York City Department of Health. Federal law precludes us from disclosing the person‚Äôs identity, and we urge you to respect the privacy of this individual and that of anyone else who may have a personal or family connection to COVID-19 exposure.  


We understand that this development may cause anxiety or concern. Please know that you have many sources of support here on campus and access to resources and accurate information¬†[on Columbia‚Äôs COVID-19 website](https://www.columbia.edu/content/coronavirus). Please continue to follow these familiar basic health precautions: wash your hands, don‚Äôt shake hands or share food and drink, cough and sneeze into your elbow, and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.  


Because this is an unfolding situation, we understand that you will have many questions, including about next week and beyond. For now, please read this information carefully, and we will follow with more in the coming days.  


**Classes**  


* For Monday and Tuesday, classes are suspended as we prepare to move to the online format.
* You will soon receive instructions from your school about how to access your classes online.  

* Some classes cannot easily move to an online format. Your school will let you know about alternate arrangements for these classes.¬†¬†  


**Exams**  


* Take-home exams will continue as usual.
* Your school will update you about arrangements for in-class exams.

**Disability Services Accommodations**  


* Disability Services will communicate with registered students about accommodations that may be needed for the online format.

**Columbia Health and CUIMC Student Health Service**  


* Most services remain open to support you and your well-being. Because of the high volume of inquiries, we encourage you to use online resources for information and support.
* For your information, t[he U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html)¬†has issued recommendations that individuals at higher risk for COVID-19 complications should stay at home as much as possible. **Those at higher risk include adults over age 65 and people who have severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease.**
* You may want to take additional precautions to reduce your risk of exposure if you are immunocompromised, such as on chemotherapy, having had an organ transplant, taking immunosuppressive drugs; or have a serious cardiovascular or respiratory disease.

**Other Questions About Libraries, Fitness, Housing and Dining**  


* Campus remains open; this includes libraries and fitness centers.
* You can continue to study with friends and classmates.  

* Dining facilities and coffee shops remain open, with enhanced cleaning. All dining facilities will offer grab-and-go meal options.  

* Housing remains open, and enhanced cleaning of high-touch areas continues in all common areas of residential and academic buildings.

**Spring Break travel**

* We know many of you have questions about spring break travel. We will follow up soon with more information.¬† ¬†

**Campus Life**  


* Most schools will be on spring break from March 16 to March 20. University Life will follow up with more about campus events and activities ‚Äì both in-person and online.

**Getting Help**  


* The¬†[University‚Äôs COVID-19 website](https://www.columbia.edu/content/coronavirus)¬†has up-to-date information on all University policies and resources.
* Beginning tomorrow, Columbia Health‚Äôs COVID-19 phone hotline will be available for questions from 9 am to 5 pm Monday-Friday: 212-854-9355.  

* For concerns about bias or harassment, please speak with your Dean of Students or contact¬†[Student Conduct and Community Standards](https://studentconduct.columbia.edu/)¬†with concerns. In this unusual time, our community values of respect and consideration for each other are especially important.  


Thank you for your careful attention as we continue to develop and revise policies, with the health, safety and well-being of everyone at Columbia as our top priority.

,"Basically the background of this is I had a pretty shit fall semester due to depression/social anxiety/lack of motivation/lack of interest in my courses, and I want to turn things around this semester. I skipped lecture so many times because I felt like I could only lay in bed and cry. I felt like I couldn't really reach out to my friends about it because they seemed to have their life together, and we all know how shit CPS is. In short I am ready for that part of my life to be over. 

I am thinking of making a groupchat of people who are working on becoming better, and can encourage each other this semester. Our focus will be on attending class, going to therapy, not procrastinating, getting to the gym, making more friends, or anything else.

,"My girlfriend [18F] was just sexually assaulted at Columbia University. She is currently a NYU student, but went there for a party. She was not too drunk but at least a little buzzed when she started talking to this guy. He tried to kiss her multiple times with her resisting and eventually kissed the bottom portion of her lip. While they were talking he groped her butt even though she said no multiple times. He kept forcing himself onto her even though she said no. Finally, she was able to leave thanks to her friend.

Unfortunately I was not there (for which i feel immensely guilty).

She is currently talking to a counselor about this and she wants to remain completely anonymous (I can't blame her with all the cases of victim-blaming seen recently).

jacyf02,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:
 
I‚Äôve just announced Columbia‚Äôs approach to reopening in the fall. I also want to address a specific group of students, our international students, whose lives have been particularly disrupted by COVID-19‚Äîand who are now the subject of a deeply misguided new decision by the U.S. government.
 
Yesterday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) provided notice of federal rules that will require international students with F visas to leave the United States if their course of study is entirely online. International students enrolled in hybrid programs providing a mix of in-person and online classes will retain their visas only if they take the minimum number of online classes needed for normal progress in their degree program. Together, these changes mark a devastating reversal of federal policy announced at the onset of the pandemic.
 
Last week, I pledged to oppose restrictive immigration policies impeding the entry of international faculty, physicians, and research scholars into the U.S. Today, I repeat that pledge. The destructive and indefensible purpose driving these policies is by now all too familiar, as is the resulting damage to the nation‚Äôs academic institutions. I will not belabor these points, beyond calling on all of us to remain focused on the ways in which punitive immigration policies severely disrupt and cause enormous harm to the lives of the international students who are part of our Columbia family. With this in mind, there are three important courses of action for us to pursue in the wake of yesterday‚Äôs announcement.
 
First, as the University and each of our deans continue to make decisions about the structure of course offerings for the coming academic year, we must endeavor to configure hybrid classes providing in-person and remote learning options that alleviate the negative effect of these new regulations on Columbia students; we want our international students to be able to complete their studies here, if at all possible. Second, for the large community of international students who cannot come to Columbia because of the pandemic, we will be adapting our network of Columbia Global Centers and creating Pop-Up Global Centers in new locations to provide in-person academic and peer engagement. And, third, as I stated last week, we must continue to vigorously oppose immigration policies that damage Columbia, higher education, the national interest, and the international students, researchers, and faculty who immeasurably enrich our institution and the intellectual and personal experiences of each of us.
 
We are continuing to consider the implications of yesterday‚Äôs announcement and will be providing additional guidance. The International Students & Scholars Office (ISSO) is a wonderful resource for all of our international students‚Äîshould you have any additional questions or concerns, please reach out to Associate Provost David Austell (david.austell@columbia.edu), or Associate Director Samantha Lu (samantha.lu@columbia.edu).

Teacher's College has announced it's going fully online. Cases across the United States continue to skyrocket. And in order for Columbia to reopen in person, Cuomo has to move NYC to a Level 4 Reopening, right now we are at Level 2.

But know that under current policy, taking leave means giving up housing in NYC. Impossible for many of us. Sign our petition to make sure than anyone who wants to take leave can take leave.

So I'm assuming if this happened to you, you were only torrenting legal files and got booted, and you don't want anything on your file (which is what happened to me) so you can use the airportclown thing.

Dear Students,

Earlier today, Columbia University announced that all undergraduate students are eligible for up to $500 in emergency funding to assist with travel, storage, and moving logistics, resulting from yesterday‚Äôs announcement that all classes will be conducted online for the remainder of spring semester and the strong recommendation that undergraduate students depart campus by March 30, 2020. Students on study abroad programs are also eligible for this emergency funding.

Students who require financial assistance in order to depart campus or return from study abroad should complete the below form(s):
Spring 2020 Housing Status form, due by Monday, March 16 at 5:00 p.m.; be sure to indicate your planned departure date.

COVID-19 Emergency Funding Form for CC/SEAS undergraduates; due by Friday, March 20 at 5:00 p.m.
The funds will be disbursed as an advanced refund via direct deposit through SSOL.
Please note that you must have direct deposit set-up on your student account to receive immediate access to the funds. Otherwise, a check will be mailed to your address of record.
Funds will be disbursed within 3-5 business days. It may take longer for you to access the money if your bank does not immediately release the funds.
The $500 of emergency funding is separate from any financial aid you may receive and is intended to reduce obstacles that may prevent your departure from campus or return home from study abroad. Those of you on financial aid may have additional questions about how your aid will be impacted by the housing and dining refund process. As financial aid and your student account are unique to you and your family circumstances, we will be reviewing and responding to individual questions and concerns over the coming days. Your patience is greatly appreciated.

We want to reiterate that students are strongly encouraged to leave campus as soon as you are able, for your own health and safety as well as that of the larger community.

Thank you,

Like I've even seen publications quoting people like ""John Doe, SEAS '20"" instead of just "" '20"", and it seems like the groups are provided differing services by the university's career services center/housing office/registrar/financial aid/etc. At my school there's literally only one pathway into our undergrad program (apart from transferring), and the humanities, STEM, and older/nontraditional students all apply in one unified process, so even though there are informal cliques and groups, there are a lot fewer formal ways for the university bureaucracy to serve us differently. I'm not trying to argue that one system is better than the other, but I've asked CU students and nobody really can explain to me why it's structured like so.

,"Dear Undergraduate Students,

As many of you are now aware, last night a black Columbia College student was the victim of a disturbing incident at Barnard College in which the student was confronted by Barnard‚Äôs Public Safety officers.

We recognize there is a continued legacy of anti-black racism that has existed in our country since its founding. The more recent climate of racism and inflammatory rhetoric in both the country and the world at large continues to demonstrate a rising trend that targets marginalized populations. We are disturbed that such incidents continue to occur so close to home, and share in the hurt and pain many of you may be feeling.

A number of you have been in touch with individuals in our offices to express the disappointment, anger, sadness and threat to safety caused by this incident, now one of several that our campus has grappled with during the academic year. As many of you are aware, there was a reflection session which took place in Lerner Hall earlier this evening. While we understand the importance of these times to gather, reflect and heal, we know that much more must be done and everyone must be engaged, not only those immediately impacted.

Our community offers many opportunities to take action, and we encourage you to connect with¬†Multicultural Affairs¬†and¬†Multicultural and Social Justice Education Programs¬†to engage further with these topics and the ways in which we can continue to improve the experiences of students from all communities. We also encourage you to share your ideas for what more we can do to address these issues at¬†undergraduate@columbia.edu. Each email will be read and responded to and we commit to providing the community with an update before the semester ends.

Words will never be enough to address the injustices that affect the world and, as a result, our campus community. We also recognize that we cannot fully comprehend the pain of the black community that arises from this incident and others like it that have occurred elsewhere.

We can, however, work together to build a community on campus in which all members feel safe and welcome. This can only be achieved with the combined effort of every member of our campus community ‚Äî staff, students, faculty. It is a goal fundamental to the values of the education we provide, and a goal that we collectively must work towards each day. We encourage each and every one of you to join us in reflecting on the ways in which our efforts can be elevated.

We realize this incident raises questions about ideas of safety on campus, what safety means and how it feels for students in different communities, particularly those in the black community. All of us move through the world with different experiences of access and privilege, and though no one individual action will adjust for these inequalities in their entirety, we are determined to continue the difficult work to better our community.

TheMoreOne,"> Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:
> 
> I write today from our Morningside Heights campus, which now has an eerie and uncharacteristic stillness about it, with three purposes. The first is to express my deepest appreciation to everyone for the extraordinary actions taken over these past two weeks to transform the University in ways that will allow us, as much as possible, to continue our work while we, the nation, and the world confront the unprecedented threat of the virus known as COVID-19. I am in awe of the students‚Äîand the staff, parents, and friends who supported them‚Äîwho moved out of the residence halls these last few days, not just for the orderly ways in which it was carried out but for the spirit of citizenship and shared sacrifice that defined it. You heeded the call and showed that there is still, indeed, life in the commons. To those students who have needed to remain due to exceptional circumstances, I want to reassure you that we will continue to provide essential services even with the announcement today from the governor to further reduce our workforce. 
> 
> The second purpose for this message is to say that, with the exception of clinical education, I am postponing all instruction for the first three days of next week in order to give everyone a little more time to prepare to resume classes for the final few weeks of the semester. Classes will continue virtually on Thursday, March 26th. And, further, with respect to courses, working with each of your schools, we have decided that all classes this semester will be graded pass/fail. This, of course, does not reflect a reduction in expectations, but rather an acknowledgment of the severe complications of this unusual moment. 
> 
> The third purpose is heartbreaking. Given life as it now is, we cannot go forward with Commencement ceremonies on May 20th, as planned. And, unfortunately, we are not in a position at this moment to announce an alternative plan. The situation is too uncertain, and any plans made now run a high risk of having to be abandoned as circumstances change. But this I can assure you: I will confer degrees on May 20th. We are and will continue thinking about this every day, and we will have a plan to honor and celebrate your successes. Speaking personally, there is no academic ceremony I love more, and I expect to love this one the most. 
> 
> The world has moved on to a different plane, one none of us could have anticipated a short while ago. I want to say, on behalf of all of Columbia, that we are, as always, ready to do our part, which, given the assembled talent and public spiritedness of this community, is never inconsiderable. While a stillness pervades Morningside Heights, that does not mean our work has abated. Meanwhile, a very different atmosphere characterizes our medical campus in Washington Heights, where our colleagues are girding to face the fraught and daunting challenges to come. Indeed, the outpouring of time, effort, commitment, and personal sacrifice of those serving on the front line of the CUIMC campus are already very palpable. This dedication also portrays the work of all employees essential to keeping the University in operation. My deepest thanks to everyone.

melodamna,"Hi everyone,

I am a Columbia student staying on campus and we just got a notice yesterday that Housing is going to consolidate us into first-year dorms (quote from their email: ""buildings adjacent to South Lawn""). This would, of course, exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, as we will be crammed into using shared bathrooms (4 students per bathroom) and a massive shared kitchen, which will backfire on the efforts of social distancing. Our alternative is then to move students into upper-class dorms; with suite-style living, we can minimize kitchen and bathroom use without having much contact with other students.

I've worked with other students staying on campus to draft out emails to administration regarding this issue. We have sent the petition & first wave of co-signs but we are still waiting for more co-signs! We will send new waves of co-signs intermittently. If you have a specific issue regarding your building, feel free to email res life administration directly (besides the housing email, [here's a list of contacts](https://www.cc-seas.columbia.edu/studentlife/staff)). Every signature, every email counts!! Columbia has a responsibility to protect its students‚Äîmore so in these confusing times.

arnesenfan,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community:  


In early July, I wrote to announce our plans for how Columbia would operate in the coming academic year in the face of an historic pandemic. The goal underlying and animating that message remains the same today: to continue our mission of research, education, clinical care, and service with all the dedication we can summon and consistent with the highest degree of safety and wellbeing for our entire community that we can possibly achieve. Between then and now the institution has dedicated every possible minute and resource to that end. In addition to the creativity applied to revising our academic life, we have reshaped our landscape of public health. There has been robust training; implementation of symptom attestation, testing, and contact tracing programs; and multiple sessions to prepare our communities for this new life. We have transformed our physical spaces to minimize risk and to optimize campus life in a socially distant environment.¬†¬†  


These extraordinary efforts have made it possible to bring back almost ten thousand faculty, researchers, and essential employees to continue and resume clinical care, education, and research on campus. We have instituted an internally run testing program, through which we have not yet seen a positive test result. I am profoundly grateful to everyone involved for their relentless efforts in getting us to this point.¬†  


In that July letter, I also indicated our need to evaluate the circumstances prevailing at this time, and I committed to sharing with you a final assessment by August 15. Now is that moment. While New York City is well along in its phased reopening process, as we all know, the surges of the pandemic continue and its grip on American life has not eased. This, unfortunately, has consequences for us. Though six weeks ago we thought that we could safely house 60 percent of Columbia College and Engineering undergraduates in our residence halls, today we have concluded that we must drastically scale back the number of students we can accommodate in residence on campus, thereby limiting residential-style living only to Columbia College and SEAS undergraduates who must be present on campus due to personal or academic circumstances. Housing arrangements for School of General Studies undergraduates will remain unchanged. We will continue to evaluate undergraduate housing options for the spring term.¬†  


We remain committed to the academic success of all undergraduate students in these difficult circumstances, and we will make provisions for the return to residence halls of students who cannot pursue their academic programs successfully without being present on campus. This includes those without access to stable internet, quiet study space, and other prerequisites for remote learning, and those whose academic progress depends upon lab research, access to special archives, or other activities that cannot be effectively accomplished online. Your deans will be in touch with details about these provisions for student return.  


This is a hard and difficult decision. Many of you are aware that State protocols require all students from the now 31 states and 2 territories included in New York‚Äôs high-risk list to quarantine for 14 days once they arrive here. A very large percentage of our residence hall population falls into this category. Affected students are required to reside alone in their dorm rooms, or (as would be the case for most students) in hotels, or other private quarters, at all times.  


While I am supportive of the measures New York State has imposed, and while I have no doubt that we could ensure a safe quarantine period from a public health standpoint, two weeks is a long time to endure isolation, especially for students who will be leaving home for the first time. Conditions for all students in quarantine will be austere, to say the least. And, of course, after the quarantine period ends, various restrictions related to social interactions and other forms of gatherings on campus will remain in place, limiting the quality of life for students residing on campus because of the nature of dormitory-style spaces. These two considerations combined are a major part of our decision.  


With few undergraduate students living on campus, we have decided that all undergraduate courses will be virtual. There is the physical capacity to conduct many undergraduate courses in person, but students now will be living in so many locations, and under such varied circumstances, that online instruction is the only realistic approach. This means that, no matter where undergraduates spend the fall term, many courses and opportunities for interaction with faculty will be available to each student. There will still be the chance to learn from some of the finest minds and teachers in the world and to experience the dazzling creativity that marks a truly outstanding university such as Columbia.  


Now, there are very important points to add. Despite these changes, necessitated as they have been by the particular circumstances of undergraduate life, Columbia will continue to be open and moving ahead towards our goal of regaining every essence of personal intellectual engagement. The careful metrics, grounded in science, that we have established to assess whether we have achieved the necessary conditions for return have been satisfied. Graduate and professional schools are executing carefully constructed plans for the upcoming term, with many having converted to hybrid and in-person models that will allow for some classroom-based instruction, while taking into account the needs of international and other students who may be unable to be physically present due to immigration or travel restrictions or other reasons. Approximately 40 percent of all graduate courses offered this fall will be hybrid or in-person (including my small seminar on Advanced Issues in the First Amendment in the Law School), and I completely support and admire deans who are offering these forms of instruction despite the many obstacles we have all confronted. In every school and college, and all across the University, we see faculty demonstrating impressive resilience and creativity in designing and redesigning their courses and displaying the passionate commitment to their students that Columbia is justifiably known for.¬†  


That brings me to the last observation. There is every reason to believe that the conditions that we are experiencing now will continue in one form or another, in one degree or another, for an extended period. Even if one is, as I am inclined to be, optimistic about getting all this behind us, we must assume we will be living with a significant degree of uncertainty for quite some time. That means many things. Among them, we must be prepared to shift as conditions change. We should, accordingly, think of the decision about undergraduates and the fall term as part of a phased return. We need to establish a sense of confidence among us, turn to our experts in public health for guidance, calibrate our sense of risk based on best evidence, think in terms of the common good, and talk‚Äîagain and again. Finally, as many of our rhythms of intellectual life are disrupted, we must make sure we are experimenting and learning from the vast array of teaching opportunities we will be exploring.¬†  


This is a moment to give our primary focus to our students, and I know I speak on behalf of the entire faculty and staff when I say this is being done. We know your lives are being shaped by this pandemic in ways you never contemplated possible. Please know we stand ready to help. And, a final expression of unending gratitude to all within the Columbia community who are making this journey feel like a true community effort.¬†

textures777,"As the title says, I've had second thoughts on committing to GS since I received my acceptance.

If the ""School of General Studies"" really is just an (awkward) administrative title, why does Columbia's website promote the fact that ""GS Students take the same classes and have the same professors as CC and SEAS students"". If that's the case, why even separate a body of students administratively, if they are taking the same classes and have the same professors?

I understand CC vs SEAS. Different core requirements. But the GS core is practically the same as the CC Core, save for 2 or 3 classes (I think?).

Then theres the whole issue with lack of proper financial aid, diploma typed in English (instead of Latin), etc. Little things here and there that make GS less ""desirable"" than CC.

On a more personal note, I'm transferring in with an Associate's Degree, with around 75 credits. I've received offers from other schools who accepted anywhere from 60-70 of those credits, but Columbia only accepted 31 according to the transfer credit report I received.

I learned about GS 2 years ago and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to attend a school like Columbia. I worked super hard to maintain a really high GPA, taking 4 classes in the evening while working full time during the day etc. I was so happy when I got accepted. But reading forums, it seems a lot of people are dissatisfied with GS and feel like ""second class citizens"", and that combined with less than half of my credits being transferred makes me hesitant to accept Columbia's offer. It would probably take me 3 years to finish my Bachelor's now.

**TL/DR: Got accepted to Columbia GS, hesitant to commit because of the ""General Studies"" stigma and less than half of my credits being transferred/accepted. Is it worth the ""Ivy League Education""? Can anyone in GS tell me what your experience has been so far, honestly?**

ColumbiaTorrenter,"**Why do I get caught? **

There are agencies whose sole purpose is to sit on torrent peer swarms looking for people. They are hired by content firms such as the MPAA to monitor individual torrents and observe who connects and downloads them. Everyone who connects to the swarm (i.e. opens that particular torrent) is assumed to have downloaded the file. That person's IP address is logged, and their ISP (Internet Service Provider) is notified. 

**What's an IP address and who is my ISP?**

An IP address is a number assigned to you by your ISP. When the ISP receives a request to send stuff to an IP address, it looks you up and forwards that communication to your computer. IP addresses are assigned to ISP's in blocks, so that the ISP for a given address is very easy to discover. 

As for who your ISP is, your ISP is Columbia University! The reason that we all enjoy such fast internet (most of the time, at least) is because Columbia quite literally has a wire that goes from your computer into the high-capacity ""backbone"" network that drives the internet. This is exactly the service that an ISP provides. Awesome! 

However, there are regulations that all ISP's, including Columbia, must conform to. Among them is something that sounds arcane to non-computer people: All IP to MAC mappings must be logged for at least 28 days. 

**What the hell does that mean?**

When you log onto the network, you need to be given an IP address from Columbia's internal pool of addresses. Your computer has something called a ""hardware address,"" or MAC address, which can be used to uniquely identify you inside a network. The ISP is responsible for taking communications destined for IP address X and mapping them to MAC address Y. 

You can think of your MAC address as your social security number, and your IP address as your phone number. The ISP plays the role of the phone company, tying phone numbers to people. 

Those mappings need to be logged for at least 28 days, according to federal regulations. In other words, when one of those agencies complains to Columbia about your IP address being used for torrenting, Columbia is required to know that that address belongs to you for at least 28 days. 

**So then what happens when I get busted?**

Columbia receives the complaint for your IP address, looks up what MAC address is mapped to it, and places it on a special list. Then next time you try to use your internet, it will deal with you accordingly. 

By the way, it's really not *that* bad, provided you only get in trouble once. For the first offense, you just have to apologize. You read a description of those agencies from further up, promise not to do it again, and get your internet back. 

The second time around, you have to face the dean. Something tells me the dean has better things to do than go after file sharers, but I'm not about to be the one to find out. 

**So I'm screwed?**

Well, not quite. Columbia might give you your IP address, but you're the one who reports your MAC address to Columbia. If you can use a bogus MAC address, Columbia will let you online, and if you get busted, you just make up a new MAC address. Easy! 

**So how do I do this magical MAC address switching? **

That takes a little bit of work. I'm currently working on a little Mac OS application that will let you change your MAC address whenever you like. This way, they can block your bogus address from the internet, but who cares? You can just move on to another one. 

I'll be posting my trick here in a few days, so stay tuned! Until then, here are some tips for not getting caught: 

* Use a private tracker. Private trackers typically are on the lookout for snitch accounts and ban them on sight, so you're not likely to be seen by them. 

* Don't torrent anything too popular. Monitoring torrents takes money, so only the highest value targets will be monitored. For instance, a movie that just came out is far more likely to be monitored than one that came out years ago.

* Stream, don't download. Most movies are available for streaming online, and streaming is impossible to monitor. I can't link to any pages here, but a well-placed google search should be enough to find one.

SamSamSamLHSam,"Dear fellow members of the Columbia community,

Today‚Äôs inspiring and quite beautiful Commencement reminds us that with resilience and countless acts of generosity, the University has remained open and, to a surprising degree, energetic. Instruction has continued, student projects have advanced, networks have extended, measures of assistance have been enacted. Staff and faculty are working assiduously at home, often harder than ever, while others are navigating the city to protect and maintain the campus. Most notably, clinical care has courageously deepened, at no small human cost.

Moving as these achievements have been, no one would like to see anything but the return of vibrant and healthy density. During the past days, my in-box has filled with a series of significant questions that deal with this aspiration. Why is the University adopting a three-term model? How are the [working groups](https://provost.columbia.edu/news/recovery-planning) proceeding to design the next phase as the pandemic winds down? How will the views of the larger Columbia community shape their recommendations? When can we expect more information?

The decision announced last week by President Bollinger to make flexible use of the Fall 2020, Spring 2021, and Summer 2021 terms is of pivotal significance. Many are curious about what this decision means both for the University and for their own situation.

Of course, any potential redistribution of teaching and learning across a longer arc of time generates issues that must be addressed‚Äîmore on that in a moment‚Äîbut this schedule for 2020-21 is designed to achieve three desirable outcomes: (1) ensure that a higher proportion of academic undertakings, especially teaching but also a wider range of intellectual and extracurricular interactions, can happen in person; (2) enhance health and safety by monitoring and controlling the speed at which we return to full campus life; and (3) advance the goal that plans being made by new and continuing students regarding the pace of their education will not be disappointed.¬†

Many questions follow, including these: How will courses and teaching effort be distributed across the three terms? With what combinations of virtual and face-to-face instruction? What is the appropriate sequencing of renewed campus life? How will year-long writing projects, field requirements, and patterns of summer internships be managed?¬†

We are a complex university. Our undergraduate colleges, and graduate and professional schools, including those offering clinical training, have a heterogeneous character and diverse needs. The three-term model thus will be implemented distinctively across these sites and within discrete programs. To this end, active consultations, discussions, and scenario planning have begun in each of our schools, and, where appropriate, across institutional lines (a key example is the active collaboration that is underway among Columbia College, SEAS, General Studies, and Barnard.)

These deliberations are being guided by questions and specifications generated by the Education Working Group, one of four currently at work to intensively plan details that will advance the human and physical renewal of our campus. Among other key matters, this group is focusing on technology innovations that can best support various forms of remote, in-person, and hybrid instruction.

As many of you know, there are three other working groups‚ÄîPublic Health, Facilities and Campus Life, and Research‚Äîthat have begun to shape the details regarding how Columbia will be renewed responsibly. These advisory bodies, each meeting three times a week and closely sharing agendas and judgments, are systematically reviewing in real time what we most usefully can do to advance campus density safely. Public Health is providing guidance to inform the revitalization of activities within a risk matrix that is being applied by each school. Facilities is considering such basic matters as how physical facilities, from classrooms to bathrooms, can be rearranged to maximize safety. Research is steering the processes associated with a properly protected restoration of laboratory, clinical, and field investigations.

These working groups report their findings and recommendations to deans and their schools and to the President‚Äôs Advisory Task Force on COVID-19 that meets almost every day to review how changes to the public health environment should condition the decisions we are taking. As much is not yet known about the rate at which we can progress, all of us with the responsibility to guide policymaking are proceeding with deliberation in a spirit of modesty.

The challenges every university faces at this moment in moving forward responsibly are intricate. Knowledge about COVID-19‚Äôs impact and future course is uneven and incomplete. It is premature to precisely project what campus life will be like at the opening of the fall term. We thus have set the start of July as a target for necessary judgments‚Äîevery day brings more knowledge‚Äîbut we cannot wait until then to enhance the prospects of a robust academic year.¬†

To that end, the active planning process will rely on consultation within our schools and with the University Senate, together with accelerated patterns of communication through regular messaging, town halls, and other means. As we renew the campus, placing safety first, we will, of course, give priority to immediate issues, but without losing sight of longer-term prospects for a university ever more alive to enlarged purposes and responsibilities.¬†

Looking forward,

Ira

sweet_salad,"Hi All,

Columbia College senior here. I've just received notice from my academic advisor that I am 0.5 credits short (123.5 total) from graduating this semester. I have a good relationship with my advisor and had received confirmation from her last semester and this semester that I was on track for graduating on time. I also have approval from my respective major departments that I'm good to go. I'm not exactly sure what happened; but in speaking with my advisor on the phone, it sounds like the DAR counted an elective credit it should not have. Either way, I probably should have caught it earlier, but I'm not very good at understanding all of the exceptions Columbia employs when it comes to graduation requirements and credits.

Getting this news sucks, obviously, and I'm wondering what the hell to do considering I have a job to start in California in July (which will want my transcripts/confirmation of my diploma being conferred.)

Just wondering if anyone has had something similar happen to themselves or has heard of anything similar happening to anyone around them. I will be meeting with my advisor tomorrow, and she has suggested that I contact the Athletics department to get registered for a PE class since they have a history of being sympathetic to situations like mine. The only other option I've come up with is taking a summer class right after graduation (May 27 - Jul 3) right before I leave to California. Anyway, help, please!


**TL;DR: 0.5 credits short to graduate in May, just found out, how do I still graduate on time?**

UPDATE:
Will be registering for the 1-credit programming language classes, which my advisor is helping me to 'add after the deadline.' Also spoke with Ken Torrey, who was willing to make accommodations and enroll me in two PE courses to cover the credit. Either way, thank you for all your help everyone and best of luck to you in finals and your summer/future engagements.",0.5 credits short,15,0.89,21c8d4,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/21c8d4/05_credits_short/,13,1395798874.0,2014-03-25 20:54:34

emtrose,"So  I am a gs student, columbia maxed out my gov. loans pretty much in the first semester.

I have looked into taking out a private loan but it seems like they all require a cosigner.

I don't really have any family except my parents and my brother.

My parents can't cosign as they're poor.  There have been times when the car broke down or there were emergencies and they needed to take out loans, and other things, so their credit isn't good. Additionally they are retiring soon so they really don't want to sign a new loan 

So how do I get a loan?

It seems like I need to be working full time to qualify without a cosigner. I will probably only be able to make 35000. I really don't think that will enable me to be able to pay directly each semester as in the past that money has just barely enabled me to live here.

I have scheduled an appt. with a financial advisor for the 3rd. I'm hoping they can help.

When I opened the official decision on my portal, I saw another note congratulating me on being designated as one of the ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù C. P. Davis scholars. 

The first thing after seeing my official decision, I checked my financial aid offer and noticed that my entire financial aid money comes from the C. P. Davis Grant. Due to this, I got nearly 6k$ more financial aid from Columbia than from Harvard (I got 0 contribution, 0 in loans from both, but no term-time work at Columbia vs. 8-12 hours/week term-time work at Harvard). That‚Äôs obviously fantastic, but I was also wondering if anyone has had any experience with this type of offer (being named a scholar in particular)? What are the other advantages and benefits of being named a scholar?

MrPokemon,"Hey guys! I'm just wondering to see how powerful our Columbia degree is when applying to grad school. *From what I have heard,* grad schools tend to view students from ""higher end"" universities (Ivies, Stanford, MIT, etc.) in a different pool of students when looking to see who to accept to their grad school program. I personally have a GPA that I am not proud of at all, but really want to get into grad school in CA (preferably Stanford, UC Berkeley, USC, etc.) for CS. Does our degree play a part at all in grad school acceptance? Does a great GRE score outweigh this low GPA? Hope you guys could enlighten me! Cheers!

can_only_speak_anon,"I voted for Trump.

There is a huge amount of misunderstanding on the part of those who are so sad and frightened right now about the election. I want to write and correct some of it. I realize that Trump is a two-faced, immoral, unqaulified asshole. He is a despicable human being on many levels. On the other hand, I accept Clinton as a lifelong public servant, superbly qualified, and I am not the least bit bothered by all the nonsense about her email.
Why then would I ever vote for Trump? Because I'm white, male, straight, and angry. I've done alright here at Columbia, no major complaints. There are opportunities closed to me because of the need for ""diversity"", because too many white men have gotten them in the past. They must go to a woman, a minority, or at least a gay man - regardless of qualifications. I've learned that I might as well not even apply. But that's not what makes me angry.

I'm angry because my work and expertise is disregarded and even suppressed. I am often on the other side with admissions and faculty recruitments. I cant go after the best qualified ones because we need diversity. So many times, here at Columbia, I have diligently worked to identify 10 superb candidates for some purpose only to be told that 3 women is not enough - gender equity demands that I replace 2 men with women, even though the pool is only 15% women. How many search committees have I been on where we rank the applicants, and all my work to identify the best ones is overruled by a dean or administrator who reaches way down the list to take a woman or a minority.
I'm especially angry at political correctness, and the practical limits on my freedom of expression. If I ever voiced an opinion against the kind of diversity criteria being applied, or rather if I didnt enthusiastically support the kind of diversity criteria being applied, I would be ostracized severely, perhaps even to the point of being driven away. Me and my opinions are not at all 'safe' here at Columbia. Hows that for tolerance? Where can we even discuss the downside of putting up 2 obviously much less qualified women in a public forum alongside 5 much better qualified men (and 3 much better qualified women)? Those selected on account of the need for diversity stick out like a sore thumb. I don't think that helps level the playing field, but I could have my professional career ended for speaking up and saying that.

So why Trump? Because he tramples political correctness. Because he tells the country that you are not electing someone because THEY deserve to be president, but because the country needs to have a job done. Because a president needs to be mean to get things done sometimes. The best way to deal with foreign leaders is to be unpredictable, and Trump is that. He will not hesitate to fight republicans as well as democrats. He will disrupt the status quo. As a country, we desperately need that.

The cost for me to attend Columbia is very high so I‚Äôve been looking into outside scholarships to cover at least half of tuition and other expenses so I won‚Äôt have to take out huge loans. 

I emailed the Financial Aid office yesterday and they have replied, ‚ÄúThe resources that students receive from outside sources become part of the financial aid award and enable students to reduce the standard Student Contribution and Work-Study/Student Employment portions of the financial aid package. These resources cannot be used to reduce or pay the Parent Contribution, but can be used to cover the cost of Columbia medical insurance.‚Äù

My parent contribution is most of the cost to attend Columbia and without outside scholarships being applicable, I would be forced to take out many big loans. 

Is there any way I can get past this barrier and somehow use my scholarships to pay for most of the cost to attend Columbia? Can I change the parent contribution to student contribution so my scholarships count toward it?

emtrose,"So I have probably spent close to a 100 dollars now securing official and unofficial transcripts.

I sent one of my transcripts over and it was immediately approved electronically.

So I went from needing four transcripts to three.

Then I sent a transcript from my community college electronically. I saw on my end that it was saying it was delivered per the community college.

So I set up an appointment with an admissions advisor, told her to check the mailbox, she saw it then approved it after it sat there for multiple days.

I was told by my culinary school that they were unable to produce an official copy due to the school being closed. I asked the admissions advisor if an unofficial copy might be accepted in these circumstances with a note detailing the reason.

I forwarded the mail from my culinary school to gsadmit, and I received no response.

Then out of the blue I received an e-mail from my culinary school that a staff member returned to produce official transcripts for select students and I was one of them.

That was about a week ago. So it should have arrived by now.

I go to check my admitted student portal today and I'm greeted by some...weird shit.

It now says I need two transcripts from my culinary school. An electronic and an official.

It also says I need to resubmit my transcript from the community college.

Previously they wanted to see if I had received satisfactory spring grades at the community college. Now it just says need official transcript.

So what I am guessing is that either something is wrong with their computer or where they previously accepted electronic copies of official transcripts they now want a paper copy.

I left a message on the gs admit voicebox. In it I was a bit upset; my frustration was quite audible. I just accentuated the weirdness of this process. I said you originally asked for these documents, I gave them, you accepted them, then you said,""Okay, now send them again"".

I have scheduled another appointment with an admissions officer following my advisor meeting tomorrow. I wonder if my advisor will be able to clarify this at all.

It's only going to cost me another 30 bucks and maybe a few weeks of waiting to try and send the transcripts again, but I really would have rather spent that money on food.

Has this ever happened to anyone else?

Does anyone have an explanation for this?

tldr: Columbia requests transcripts, I send two transcripts, both are approved, Columbia then asks for the same transcript again, possibly in a paper form as opposed to electronic, then they ask for two copies of the culinary school transcript instead of just one, the culinary school does not have a way of sending official transcripts electronically, so I have no idea how to meet that requirement",Why did columbia approve two of my transcripts then a few weeks later unapprove them?,13,0.93,h0o9g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/h0o9g4/why_did_columbia_approve_two_of_my_transcripts/,7,1591864244.0,2020-06-11 03:30:44

tiltonbush,"Hey guys,

So this Thursday I have my first Lithum midterm, and to be completely honest, I don't feel ready at all. My professor makes us create study guides for each book we read, but I'm having difficulty narrowing down the themes of each book, largely because there's just so much content to cover. I'm more of a STEM person, and when I prep for tests, I like having a lot of material to ""practice"" beforehand. However, for lithum, I'm having a harder time finding stuff to ""practice"" to prepare in time. 

Given this, do you guys have any suggestions on how to effectively prepare for my upcoming midterm?",Lithum Midterm Study Suggestions,12,0.93,dkpx0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/dkpx0m/lithum_midterm_study_suggestions/,16,1571634561.0,2019-10-21 00:09:21

prommyargentum,"Hi there everyone!

So, first off I just wanna apologise in advance if I've posted this in the wrong place; I know it says to post about admissions in the rules, but I'm not really sure if what I'm asking falls under that...if it does I'm really sorry! I just wanted to ask some quick questions regarding Columbia's interview process.

To very briefly give a little background, I'm eighteen years old and I'm in my final year of secondary school in the west of Ireland. Last month I finished my application to the Dual BA between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia, and yesterday I received an email to invite me for an interview in Dublin as part of the admissions process. Of course, I'm thrilled! I scheduled my interview for Monday 25th, giving me a little over a week to prepare.

However, I'm a little uncertain as to how I should dress. I don't want to sound very superficial by saying something like that, but this will be my first ever interview; due to physical limitations caused by severe scoliosis I've never had anything like a summer job, and here at home, colleges don't do interviews. I'm not really sure what's appropriate to wear and I don't want to be over/under dressed. I've skimmed a few articles and they recommend going ""business casual"" but then some say heels, some say flats, etc.  And on that note, what would the general consensus be on hair/makeup? Naturally I'm not thinking of walking in there looking like I'm ready for a night out or anything, but is a natural look okay, or would I be safer going without? Makeup for me is an occasional thing so I wouldn't freak out without it or anything, but I'm just not really sure. And in terms of hair, is it best to wear it up, or down? One article I read said long hair should be tied up, but does that really matter?

Also, is there anything I should be ready to talk about? They've already said to prepare to talk about my application (essays, personal statements etc) and my future academic plans, but beyond that, is there anything else? The interview is scheduled to last about half an hour, so I imagine they'll want to talk about *something*, but I can't imagine what.

I would be so so appreciative of any help you guys could offer me! Thank you all in advance :)",Interview Etiquette?,12,1.0,arc4ye,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/arc4ye/interview_etiquette/,17,1550374315.0,2019-02-16 21:31:55

I'll be honest, this is mostly to help with writing my supplemental essays. While I'm trying to get a good grasp from reading stuff off the website, I'd love to see something a little more personal. Like right now I was thinking of focusing my short essay on how I value how Columbia embraces its urban environment and utilizes that to offer more opportunities to their students, and also makes an effort to get its students involved in the community and not trapped in a college campus bubble.
