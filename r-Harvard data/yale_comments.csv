First off, is the type of radical thinking exhibited by the woman in this video representative of the campus as a whole? In your time at Yale, do you sense that ideology being present over other ones, or is there a good mix of political thought?

Secondly, a Yale senior named Aaron Lewis was quoted in the article as saying there was a ""mismatch"" between the Yale portrayed in admissions material and the ""real"" Yale. Do you agree? ",6,,False,cwvw7c4,False,False,1447197806.0,2015-11-10 17:23:26

What happens if you say that and someone gets offended? Well they can be offended, can’t they? What’s wrong with being offended? When did sticks and stones may break my bones stop being relevant? Isn’t that what you teach children? He called me an idiot! Don’t worry about it, he’s a dick!
Now you have adults going “I was offended, I was offended and I have rights!” Well so what, be offended, nothing happens. You’re an adult, grow up, and deal with it. I was offended! Well, I don’t care! Nothing happens when you’re offended. “I went to the comedy show and the comedian said something about the lord, and I was offended, and when I woke up in the morning, I had leprosy.""
Nothing Happens. “I want to live in a democracy but I never want to be offended again.” Well you’re an idiot.
How do you make a law about offending people? How do you make it an offense to offend people? Being offended is subjective. It has everything to do with you as an individual or a collective, or a group or a society or a community. Your moral conditioning, your religious beliefs. What offends me may not offend you. And you want to make laws about this? I’m offended when I see boy bands for god sake.
It’s a valid offense, I’m offended. They’re cooperate shills, posing as musicians to further a modeling career and frankly I’m disgusted.

If admission was purely merit based, there would be much less underrepresented minorities on campus. Many kids who deserve to be there merit-wise are not there in order to make room for these rude kids. These minority kids don't know what was sacrificed for them.

By yelling profanities and disrespecting the faculty members (who are actually on their side) only perpetuates the stereotype of these underrepresented minorities, and validates many's opinions that these minorities do not belong on campus.

Going to university is the start of a life-long learning experience of how to work with people coming from different cultures. It will definitely be totally different compared to being in your home town. Imagine what the international students are going through at the same time. Feeling alienated, rediscovering yourself and what's important to you, learning to work with others of different backgrounds, understanding other cultures and world views, are all part of the learning experience of being in a university.

There are a lot of similarities between all these places, with varying degrees.

I'll say this.

There are three camps. 

1. The SJW ""I'm offended by everything""/ Professional Outrage Commitee/ armchair activists. They were big in the student newspapers bitching about something, or holding some event. Again, you can find this at ANY of the top 20 universities. It was already ridiculous when went to school 2006-2010. Now, it's ""blossomed"" into something so bad, it lampoons itself. I'd say it was only 10-20% of the campus, though.

2. The 'normies.' Yes I realize the irony of throwing myself in this camp. These people were concerned about education, making friends, drinking beer, getting laid, learning, loving, figuring out life. We could give two fucks about local politics, an off-color joke someone made, how a party was offensive, Save the Trees, Save the Bees,  save the local radio station, etc. This was 65-75% of the campus. We were mostly spectators of these shit shows.

3. The people who lacked tact/ shock jockies/ racists. The rabble rousers who would either tell poor jokes like Tosh.0 ""Wouldn't it be funny if she got raped?"" ""Smelly Mexicans"" ... and crushing oreos, making racist off-color jokes, frat douchery, etc ... this was about 5% of the student body. Generally ruined shit for the rest of us, antagonized the SJW greatly, stirred up drama, all that shit.",8,,False,cwwaawp,False,False,1447223811.0,2015-11-11 00:36:51

"The New Intolerance of Student Activism: ""Who taught them that it is righteous to pillory faculty for failing to validate their feelings, as if disagreement is tantamount disrespect?""",wfwef32f23,">Political correctness is the oppression of our intellectual movement

There is no such thing as an ""intellectual movement,"" nor should political correctness be construed as a movement (granted, you did not say this). They are both *discourses.*

A movement presupposes concrete political/social goals, as well as concrete agency (i.e leadership) that pursues said goals. Neither intellectuals nor the PC crowd have *specific* goals. Their goals are so vague and general that they border on *attitudes*. When we *can* identify a specific goal (e.g. the resignation of a university president), it is because this specific goal is seen as conducive to the general goals. By contrast, a social/political movement sets out its goals to begin with (voting rights for women; free elections; desegregation--which, in the context of the civil rights movement was specific in that it challenged *specific* legislation and legal doctrines in the US legal system) and then undertakes (again, specific & programmatic) measures to see these goals effected.

As for intellectual oppression, ""oppression"" is a hyperbole and I strongly caution you against engaging in hyperbole, as most of what's wrong with the current PC discourse *is* hyperbole (that and rampant logical fallacies born of an uncritical environment). Additionally, anti-intellectualism has a long and entrenched history in the US, and PC discourse, which was largely spawned by intellectual efforts at universities, is even now a relatively insignificant source of anti-intellectualism in this country.",-1,,False,cwvno4m,False,False,1447184871.0,2015-11-10 13:47:51

From my take on the email, it seems to me that Christakis is as anti-racist as any of the student protesters. And while he is advocating for freer allowances on speech, he is not advocating that racist acts be held unaccountable.

Instead of a top-down ban on racism, this call for student dialogue seems more so an alternative, lateral push against racist behavior. Simply put, I think Christakis and his wife don't see much value in authoritative bans, but instead wish to see students themselves take the initiative to educate on and resist such behavior.

If affirmative action were to be removed from Yale, minority enrollment would drop.  There is already evidence for this in California with Proposition 209.  African-American and Latino enrollment dropped after it was passed.

There are also studies that demonstrate that African-Americans and Latinos regardless of class score lower on standardized tests.  If Yale were to have an SAT score cut-off for admission, this would effectively drop enrollment of African-American and Latino students.  It is not entirely clear why this is, one reason could be because of stereotype threat.

2.  Yes, these ethnic groups have historically been put at a disadvantage.  Here is an example:  Many criticize affirmative action because wealthy African-Americans benefit from it.  They argue that this is unfair and that disadvantaged status should be determined by one's socioeconomic class and not the color of one's skin.  This will be unpopular on Reddit, but I am prepared to argue that wealthy African-Americans ARE at a disadvantage in this country.   In America, there are stereotypes that African-Americans are lazy and unintelligent.   There is at least one study that shows that internalizing these stereotypes leads to increased anxiety while taking standardized tests leading to lower scores.  The threat of these stereotypes affect both poor and rich African-Americans.  The majority has the privilege of not having these unfortunate stereotypes about their group.

3.  Yes, lowering the bar for admission will result in equality.  Unless you think that every American student is on a level playing field, measures like affirmative action are unfortunately necessary for now if we want to live in an egalitarian society.  There will hopefully be a day in which affirmative action is no longer necessary.

I think that you are also missing the point (not just you but a large subset of the American public) that affirmative action not only benefits minority students but also majority students by exposing them to different cultures and, therefore, enriching their educational experience.  You may then question why is diversity so important for a top-notch educational experience like you would receive at Yale?  It is because exposure to different groups of people with very different experiences are essential to achieving the university's mission for creating an environment where learning and empathy are fostered.

Can you elaborate on why affirmative action is a long term disservice to the group it claims to help?

I don't believe Christakis' email does say that. She is questioning why it will be implied by a educational administration to step in (by giving advice *or* making rules) to a subject where student's should be able to think for themselves. It smacks of just an academic musing on the independence of students and an attempt to open discussion. 

Can you point out exactly where in the email you feel she thinks there is a ban of all bigotry or disrespect?

But in practice, I wonder if we should reflect more transparently, as a community, on the consequences of an institutional (which is to say: bureaucratic and administrative) exercise of implied control over college students.

""of implied control"" - is certainly not the same as her thinking that a ban will take place. To her merit, her email did achieve a discussion on the subject.

I ask because when you start talking about feelings of stress, you start getting into a very subjective realm. I know I was stressed out when I took my SAT. Is the stress from internalizing a stereotype larger than the stress of wanting to get into Yale, for example? Is this specific stressor quantified in heart-rate or some other tangible metric? Have these studies ruled out any other possible causes of lower test scores from African-American and Latino students?

I see your point about diversity, that it can create an environment in which more cultures get exposure and enrich the educational experience of all students. I agree that this has value, but there is a cost for this, and it is the rejection of students with more merit who had no say in their ethnic background. 

The reason I think affirmative action is a long term disservice is because when you lower the bar for someone, the natural response is to just shoot for the lowered bar. If they had to achieve the same level as anyone else, they may fail, but they may also work harder and actually achieve a higher level than they previously thought they could. I think AA is an indirect way to stifle the potential of bright individuals who aren't given the incentive(read:challenge) to reach the same levels as their counterparts from other ethnic groups. 

AA also creates a stigma around being a minority group student in an Ivy League school because one can assume that on the average, students from those ethnic groups scored lower on their SATs. I'm not claiming that lower average test scores make them ""lazy and unintelligent"", but if you ask me, AA doesn't serve to break down the stereotypes between ethnic groups, only build them up, which is bad for everyone in the long term.

I think it was majorly pioneered by a researcher named Steele, I forget his first name - I'm sure you can find it and many more articles. One of my majors was psychology and it's not an uncommon idea.

Whether it explains all differences in SAT scores, I don't know. But race is apparently a social construct, not a genetic one, though ... I'm no expert on the matter. If that were true it would stand to reason that the only difference in test scores would be cultural, socioeconomical (but that was controlled for), or environmental.

To be honest I used to think AA was a bit unfair, but I think it's a matter of degree. Quotas and cash prizes for hiring minorities I think is a bit too far (I've seen that at some places).

However at universities ... yes one can say that it's possible systemic disadvantages have created an unequal playing field in terms of ""reaching"" Yale, and thus a boost is needed. Also there would be a benefit to the student body to not have a completely white/ Asian campus.

I am by no means an expert on how stigma and stereotypes affect the psychology of minority students.  See below for a review article by people that know much more than me on this subject.

This article may be behind a paywall, but I am assuming that you are a Yale student and should be able to access it: http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070137

It is a comprehensive review article of the ""The Social Psychology of Stigma"" that cites relevant studies to this discussion. 

2.  I think it's too simplistic to think that lowering the bar will naturally  cause students to aim for a lowered bar.  I know that was certainly not the case for me as well as my minority colleagues.  That sort of mentality will not help one succeed at a university like Yale, where having an ambitious personality is so important.  I have faith that Yale admissions screens out applicants that do not have this attribute.  

I think we should also consider that a high SAT score in and of itself does not make one the right fit for Yale or entitled to attend Yale.  There is more to an application than GPA and SAT scores, and I am sure that minority applicants are not given a ""pass"" on things like leadership position, extracurriculars, etc.  (Anyone with more knowledge about the admissions process please correct me if I'm wrong)

3.  I do think AA creates a stigma around being a minority student at an Ivy League school.  I think the stigma exists because of ignorance.  If more people like you actually probed deeper on the issue of affirmative action and why certain groups of people are disadvantaged, I am sure this stigma will slowly disappear.

I think one of the major misunderstandings perpetuated by the media was that the first email was ""administration condescending to students."" The signatories of the email barely qualify as ""administration"" - they have the title of Dean, but they are simply the leaders of the student cultural houses and have virtually no administrative power over students. They are very much distanced and distinct from the Yale *central* administration and the Yale Executive Committee, the unit responsible for reprimanding and punishing improper student behavior. In fact, they're even physically distinct - the cultural houses are located in a row on the southwestern edge of campus, and all the main Yale administrative offices are on the opposite northeastern edge. So the first email was basically a message from student groups to their peers, just signed by the adult representatives of each student group, who again have the title of Dean but no actual administrative power.

One of the main gripes with the second email is that *Erika Christakis* clearly didn't understand that distinction at all - one of the longstanding grievances held by many minorities at Yale is that the cultural houses are perennially underfunded and more or less forgotten about by the central administration. I doubt Erika Christakis could have named all the cultural houses at this university in which she teaches before the whole controversy erupted, which is problematic given her Associate Master position giving her stewardship over students belonging to all of those cultural houses.

But of *course* the purpose of the email was to rid campus of culturally offensive costumes, but through education, not force or discipline.

I would like nothing more than to ask Erika Christakis face to face, but she has not made any appearances or statements for over a week now. I did meet Nicholas Christakis face to face. When I told him that the signees of the first email were in fact representatives of student cultural groups, it seemed like news to him.

I will be trying to understand your original comment more and be asking for clarity on several points. I would appreciate if you could help me understand more clearly your original post by answering these questions:

>""Free speech"" and the ""marketplace of ideas"" has been thrown in minorities' faces as a justification for bigotry and disrespect since always.

Who in the article used ""free speech"" or ""market place of ideas"" as justification for bigotry and disrespect? Was it anybody in the article? Can you specify a particular passage?

>This new ""coddling"" narrative from which Christakis has clearly drawn her inspiration is the same nonsense reworded for our time.

Where do you glean this information from? The article itself by Friedersdorf? Or from Christakis's email? Please can you point to specific passages in either the article or email?

>Friedersdorf suggesting this is some novel argument Christakis has made is just another example of how ignorant he is on race matters. His pontificating reeks of privileged whining.

Do you feel this the correct analysis to make on your quoted passage? Especially in regards to Friedersdorf supposed ignorance on racial issues. After all, he has got a lot of articles in regard to racial matters under his belt and appears like he has done a lot of thought on the matter. Here's some recent ones:

I won't list them all as I don't have time to read everything he has written.

In all, I feel that Friedersdorf is quite knowledgeable on race matters in the USA. Far more so than I am at the very least from the body of evidence of his writings. I feel your assertion of his ignorance on race matters to be entirely unfair and I'd like you to retract that criticism of Friedersdorf.


I also personally don't feel that his article is one of ""pontification"". Do you feel this sense of pontification that apparent? Do you think a reader like myself should be aware of it? If so, why do you think I am not aware of it?

"The New Intolerance of Student Activism: ""Who taught them that it is righteous to pillory faculty for failing to validate their feelings, as if disagreement is tantamount disrespect?""",thor_moleculez,"*sigh*

This will be the only time I attempt to explain the obvious.

Christakis is arguing that it is inappropriate for the dean to discourage students from wearing bigoted and disrespectful costumes because it constitutes coddling that is harmful to their intellectual development; according to Christakis, there is value in the racial conversation that occurs when white kids wear bigoted and disrespectful costumes, and for Christakis this justifies the bigotry and disrespect these costumes entail. This ""racial conversation"" is very obviously a different way of saying ""marketplace of ideas"" (the conversation consists of opposing ***ideas*** of what racism is and how it is harmful), which has also been used to justify bigotry and disrespect. So this is not some novel argument Christakis is making. Friedersdorf then seems ignorant of racial matters when he suggests that this is in fact some new way of looking at race relations. It's the same argument hammered into shape to fit the anti-PC ""coddling"" narrative we've seen in the popular press.

Also, I'm well aware that Fridersdorf has made a career out of being a white privilege denialist, no need to link me his lengthy resume of stupidity. I will point out that writing a lot of words about a topic does not make you an authority. I could write thousands of words on theoretical physics, but that doesn't mean I have the first fucking clue of what I'm talking about on matters of theoretical physics. Same here with Friedersdorf. And no, I don't have the time or inclination to go through every single one of his bloviations about race to prove this point to some tedious JAQing redditor, it should be enough to point out that he's wrong *here* to spur you to look at his writing with a more critical eye. Maybe you should google some criticism of Friedersdorf, that would be a good place to start.

"The New Intolerance of Student Activism: ""Who taught them that it is righteous to pillory faculty for failing to validate their feelings, as if disagreement is tantamount disrespect?""",thor_moleculez,"Many reasons! First, the racism and abuse I'm getting in retaliation for going against the reddit hivemind is causing frustration that bleeds over into other conversations, this one included. Second, he has an overly-polite writing style that is starting to seem patronizing. Third, I've not said anything new this entire conversation because his questions have not been relevant or penetrating, so I doubt his ability to intellectually engage the issue. Fourth, him linking Fridersdorf's resume of white privilege denialism at me as if it constitutes proof that Fridersdorf actually knows something about race is actually just proof that, despite having very strong opinions on the matter, Brevard himself has never *really* engaged with contemporary race issues. It's clear from his thinking and his sources that he's coming at this from a very narrow perspective, and this is entirely his fault; google is a thing, and the only reason one does not use it to seek out contravening opinions is one has already decided those opinions are wrong (or one encounters them on a daily basis, like I do on reddit).

Brevard's self-inflicted ignorance matters, too; his voice joins a chorus singing the song of ""you're too sensitive"" and ""what about muh free speech???"" at minorities who suffer real burdens from racism.

Yalies should band around an idea to eliminate pernicious discrimination once and for all: numbered identities for applicants. Take race and name out of the equation. Gender might be harder because of team identity. We can get rid of the racist canard that Asians have no personality. Unfortunately, institutionally racist policies will persist at top schools for a while. It's also not in the interest of white Yalies to bring true meritocracy, in all its forms (tests, recommendations, activities) into the admissions process in a race-blind manner. In all likelihood, Asians would be the majority, much as blacks are the majority in football, basketball, track. Hard to discriminate in sport. Much easier to be racist in academic and corporate America.",2,,False,g1ilfdi,False,False,1597460980.0,2020-08-14 22:09:40

—My Opinion—

I don’t agree that schools should maximize for faculty diversity *necessarily*. They should focus on hiring the best of the best. To me, academia is about credibility, not skin color.

"Does the Yale student body support the statement ""This is not about creating an intellectual space, this is about creating a home?""",yerbert,"I can provide a little context to show why the statement isn't ludicrous. Someone from Yale wrote a good response in the main video but it got buried.

At Yale, students live in ""residential colleges"" on the Oxford and Cambridge model. Its a small community, with about 100 people in your year in your college, and most live on campus all four years. You live in your college itself, which is a basically dorms built around a courtyard. Colleges are the heart of social life at Yale. 

The student in the video was confronting the master of her college. Master is the person in charge of managing the social life in the college. The role is therefore different than your average faculty member, whose job it should be to challenge students intellectually. 

The master is meant to be someone all students can go to in times of stress or when they are upset and have someone to talk to. When she challenges the master in the video, she asks him why he accepted the job. She doesn't mean the job of professor, she means the job of master, and that comes with different responsibilities. 

I suspect she now wishes she managed her emotions better during the exchange, but that alone shouldn't lead to the condemnation we've seen. 

tl;dr - The master plays a unique role at Yale, and in part, that role is about creating home.

No.

>It started with very public & very loud attacks on the leaders of the academic community. 

No, it didn't. Quite the opposite, actually. The purpose was to get rid of the old culture, which was only possible through destroying existing cultural paradigms, which were dictated by the elites, which therefore had to be ousted.     
That is why it started with very public & very loud attacks on *the Bourgeoisie*. Many intellectuals were simply part of that elite. They were, in fact, their own elite. *That* is what was targeted to be destroyed. Hence the fact that so many intellectuals were abused or sent to labour camps.

This all happened to annul elites, bring about more equality in education, and to make high levels of education and intellectualism one of the cornerstones of Chinese culture among the general population (which in many ways succeeded, by the way, hundreds of millions people suddenly had access to education health care that was previously reserved for the rich). 

Seems like these things are still highly misunderstood in the US. These movements weren't ""anti-intellectual"" in the least (in fact, they thought to promote intellectualism among more people), it was anti-aristocratic. It isn't actually all as bad as anti-communist propaganda wants you to believe. These things weren't senseless. Without them many good things wouldn't be the way they are. In fact, like it or not, without Mao China would still be a shithole of a developing nation rued by aristocrats. However, of course these things were often implemented very badly and myopically, but would anything have changed in a reasonable amount of time through reform? Without forceful revolution? Do you believe that? Is the alternative better? I am pretty sure Chinese people today would rather live in the country they  live in today than in a country where these things never happened.
 
I am not saying this to defend the actions of Mao, I am sure that there were better solutions to bringing about that necessary change (although I personally can't think of one, rich elites don't tend to give up their power or wealth without a fight). I am just saying that if this was about anti-elitist behaviour, do call me! As once these people start overthrowing rich elites, I will stand right with them.

""This is not about creating an intellectual space, this is about creating a home?"" - to be sure, the term ""intellectual space"" is general enough that it can be taken poorly. Even the residential building, after all, is at its best a somewhat intellectual space when its filled with Yale students.

However, the primary job of the master is to facilitate students' intellectual pursuits, and not to place him or herself at the center of the debate. That is for the classroom and extra-curriculars, not the residential college. 

I also don't think anyone was asking for ""coddling"" exactly. The weird thing about Christakis's email is that it responded to a university-wide email urging people to be respectful when they chose a costume. Did that email really call for a response?

However, ""comfort"" is something people should have in their homes, even if their home is at Yale.

tl;dr The residential college is indeed primarily a living space, and to the extent that she was distinguishing that from a center of intellectual debate, the statement makes sense.

"Does the Yale student body support the statement ""This is not about creating an intellectual space, this is about creating a home?""",SnowOhio,"In general, there are ""issues"" on campus the same way there are issues with the treatment of minorities in the country at large. E.g. casual slights like ""Where are you from?"" even though I'm born and raised in Cleveland, that kind of stuff which is largely a non-issue for me and usually the result of well-meaning ignorance. If you take to time to explain to people what they are saying, they will usually apologize for not realizing that their words could potentially  be interpreted as being culturally insensitive. Shouting ""CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE"" and calling white people ""disgusting"" can do nothing but foster animosity. 

I'll admit things can be a little worse at Yale (Ivy League, WASP roots, institutional power, yadda yadda). The incidents on campus are largely spurring by a specific event, which was an [SAE Halloween party](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/11/02/students-accuse-yale-sae-fraternity-brothers-of-having-a-white-girls-only-policy-at-their-party/) that allegedly turned away non-white students from their ""whites only"" party. Which is super shitty if true and understandably created tension on campus. Then, there was [an email an associate master sent out](https://www.thefire.org/email-from-erika-christakis-dressing-yourselves-email-to-silliman-college-yale-students-on-halloween-costumes/) arguing against strict university restrictions of student dress for Halloween costumes:

> ...if you don’t like a costume someone is wearing, look away, or tell them you are offended. Talk to each other. Free speech and the ability to tolerate offence are the hallmarks of

> ...I think there might be something

> on campus, and it is this: What does this debate about Halloween costumes say about our view
> of young adults, of their strength and judgment?

I agree with the email and think that it is well-worded and reasonable, but a lot of students interpreted this as her implicit support for blackface and other racial caricatures.

Personally, I think that wherever you go, there are people who will be assholes. Learning to either civilly address them or completely ignore them is something we teach children. Or to put it bluntly: [be offended, nothing happens!](https://youtu.be/fHMoDt3nSHs?t=3m36s). If you disagree with the establishment and wish to exercise your civil rights to hold protest and demonstration, [this](http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/54bc1ccbecad04fb41e364cc/the-most-iconic-parts-from-martin-luther-kings-i-have-a-dream-speech.jpg) is what it looks like to positively empower a marginalized community and combat bigotry.

There are flaws with the university and there are flaws with this country. What's great is that we can point out these flaws and call for positive change without fear of institutional retaliation and threat-to-life. Society advances when a group of people can create an impetus for it to recognize and work to remove its existing faults instead of turning into a witch hunt or mob.

My parents fled their country as students because the state was massacring them. They did not speak a word of English, and as a result, my brother and I both grew up in a childhood of poverty and were routinely picked on for being outsiders to American culture.

"Does the Yale student body support the statement ""This is not about creating an intellectual space, this is about creating a home?""",,"Here's the thing about that column, well-written as it may be -- if speech should be spoken based on its ""helpfulness,"" then who's deciding what counts as helpful?  Bryniarski seems to be exemplifying what Christakis is worried about when she says ""I don’t, actually, trust myself to foist my Halloweenish standards and motives on others.""  Even though his motives are good and his ultimate cause of social justice is one that the vast majority of this campus believes in, he is still suggesting that the opposition's speech has no value purely because his moral outlook says so.

In the lead-up to Halloween, before any of this went down, I remember hearing two students discussing racist Halloween costumes.  One recalled seeing someone dressed as an ISIS fighter -- which is undoubtedly a costume in bad taste at the very least -- and immediately declared that the person wearing it was a disgusting human being.  The other student agreed wholeheartedly.

This kind of speech isn't ""helpful,"" as I see it.  Immediately declaring your political enemies to be subhuman seems to be a trend now, on both sides of the aisle and even, apparently, at Yale.  It made me extremely uncomfortable to hear, but I didn't say anything, because I felt there was no way to articulate my misgivings without the other two immediately lumping me in with the racists.

So a few days later, students receive Christakis's email, which at least in part touches on what I'm trying to say here.  It was certainly not an angry letter calling students little snots for wanting SAE to not be racist.  It was an assertion that racism should be confronted by students, instead of solved from above by the administration.

And then within days there were 750 people signing a google doc personally insulting Christakis and telling her that her academic opinion came too close to violence against minorities.  I don't care if she IS the associate master; that doc was the first block of text in this whole debacle that I couldn't believe at first was written by a Yalie due to its vitriol.  There was no ""helpfulness"" there, just mudslinging.

You point out that Christakis is the associate master and therefore has duties above those of a normal professor.  You're quite right, but as far as I can tell, the email is actually *fulfilling* those duties, not betraying them.  The first line of the email cites frustration among some unknown number of Sillimanders with the original email from the university committee, which is apparently why Christakis felt the need to write her own.

In this situation, though I would agree that the Christakis email was unhelpful, because it caused a lot of pain without adding much to the conversation at all. Let me explain what I mean - I've been spending all day trying to explain how I see it to various redditors with varying degrees of success.

You said that Christakis's email ""was an assertion that racism should be confronted by students, instead of solved from above by the administration."" Honestly, that's what I got from the first email from the IAC, and I think most people saw it that way. The first email was just saying ""fyi things like blackface are offensive, you have the right to wear it but other students may confront you about it."" Christakis said in her email that she felt fear and uncertainty about wearing a sari as a white woman or dressing a little girl as Tiana or Mulan when pretty much nobody would be opposed to that (from people I've talked to including many open letter signers). I certainly have no problem with those things. When you respond to friendly note basically saying ""Please play nice with each other!"" with a two-page email basically saying ""M-muh free speech!"" it seems like you have a vested interest in being offensive, not just that you are defending the right to be offensive.

I would therefore say that the email is betraying her duties as Assoc. Master because she placed herself in opposition to parts of the Silliman community by facetiously insinuating that there is some campus conspiracy to infringe on free speech and that elements of it exist in the Silliman community.

As for whose version of ""helpful,"" I'd say everyone should read the IAC email and decide for themselves who is in the right. I personally can't see any way the IAC email could be interpreted as a call for censorship. I also have doubts about the ""unknown number of Sillimanders."" As a Sillimander, I can tell you that most of the college doesn't know Erika Christakis very well because she's halfway through her first year, and she hasn't exactly made a huge effort to reach out to students (for comparison, I see Master (Nicholas) Christakis all the time eating ice cream in the dining hall).  I've maybe seen her once in the dining hall and once at an event in the Master's House since the beginning of this year. When I first read Erika Christakis' email, I found it really weird and a bit hard to believe that ""multiple"" Silliman students would have read that benign IAC email and immediately run to Erika Christakis to vent their frustrations. Obviously there's no way to prove this, but I think Erika Christakis made up or exaggerated the number of students protesting the IAC email to lend credence to her own projecting unfounded fears of censorship.",-4,,False,cwsejst,False,False,1446946677.0,2015-11-07 19:37:57

"Does the Yale student body support the statement ""This is not about creating an intellectual space, this is about creating a home?""",joonbar,"My two cents on this particular issue of people asking where other people who look different where they're from.

I'm half Japanese, half white American. I grew up in the heart of suburbia in the heart of the Deep South. My name is fully Japanese. People asked me/still ask me where I'm from all the time. Before I left for college (i.e., before I had lived anywhere other than where I grew up), when people asked me where I was from it usually meant what kind of name do I have/what was my heritage (when the context is pre-high school graduation, most people don't ask the question wondering if you lived in other cities beforehand). I explained that my dad was Japanese, my mom was from the states, then both of our lives moved on. I don't recall any particular instance where I felt there was any sort of negativity implied, just a question somebody asks in the process of getting to know another person.

On the flip hand, I went to weekend Japanese school growing up. The kids there were mean to me because I was American. Mixed kids, especially those who learned English before Japanese, were treated poorly by other children. My only friends were other mixed kids who also didn't fit in. If in a conversation I said I was Japanese, I was made fun of for thinking I Japanese. It was only worse in Japan. Kids there would literally point and laugh in my face, the idiot foreigner who thinks she's Japanese. 

In my experience, America's culture is much less one of exclusion. That is, in many American's minds, being American and being a member of another culture are not mutually exclusive. To my friends here, I am a Japanese-American. I belong to both and I am no less of one for being part of the other. However, in Japan, I am American. I'm even more American for ever thinking I was Japanese.

Of course, there were instances of Americans making me feel like an outsider in the States. My neighbors were very conservative and home schooled and those relationships ended after they started treating me aggressively for not being Christian (they were also children at the time, I have no clue how they are now as adults). However, the people who made me feel like an outsider were an anomaly here. It was not the general culture excluding me, it was the ones who were considered as backwards by many people. In the other part of my life, it was the Japanese culture telling me I would never belong. It is everybody, it is entirely the norm to think that way.

In summary, I have not felt that by asking where I'm from they are implying I am any less of an American. To the contrary, I am glad that at least one of my cultures is one that does not treat cultures as mutually exclusive. In America, I am both. In Japan, it has been decided for me that I'm not a member of the club. I don't mean to invalidate the experiences anybody else has had. I cannot speak to the intentions of those by whom others have been asked the question. However, I do feel that we should not be so quick to assume that asking where somebody is from automatically implies being less American.

I accepted my offer today! Officially a Yallie!!,WeHaSaulFan,"Congratulations! New Haven is very livable. It has great access to New York, but it ends up being a whole day anytime you go down to the city, so most don’t go there as much as you might think. And New Haven has a lot of the great things New York has to offer, at smaller scale. A couple of outstanding art museums, particularly the YUAG. Plenty of excellent restaurants with a good variety of price points, atmospheres and cultural traditions. Plus all the academic and cultural cornucopia that is Yale. The Peabody is gorgeous as well, though it is mostly closed for renovations well into next year.

As urban as New Haven is, it’s good to know, if you like the outdoors, that there is plenty of very accessible and friendly aquatic, biking and hiking fun available close by, with easy little jaunts along West Rock and East Rock, both of which provide amazing views of the city and the sound. A little further, but not far at all, Sleeping Giant has an excellent network of trails of varying degrees of difficulty, many of them affording very pretty views, near and far. There are plenty of seaside pleasures between New Haven and Old Saybrook, with Hammonassett Beach being a wonderful state park on the far side of Madison, 20 miles or so from campus. And greater New Haven has a very active biking community with plenty of excellent road and trail options.

Finally, since you’re going to be a grad student and will likely be around for a while, probably with access to a car, there are so many neat and fun nooks and crannies in Connecticut and further afield easily accessible within an hour or two of New Haven. Approximately 55 miles of the Appalachian Trail runs through the northwest corner, and that is beautiful territory. The Berkshires are great in Western Mass, Rhode Island has plenty of fun stuff, the Cape is a bit further out but available, likewise Boston and points north into New Hampshire, Vermont and even Maine.",19,,1585794331.0,fm6dsji,False,False,1585791843.0,2020-04-01 20:44:03

Fascism at Yale | The Harvard Law Record,Lycanthrowrug,"It would be interesting to replace 'fascist' here with 'puritanical.' We are often reminded that when English Puritans came to the Massachusetts Colony (and eventually founded Harvard), they came for the purpose of religious freedom, but what's usually left out of that narrative is the fact that their legal definition of religious freedom extended only to other Puritans. It did not grant freedom to Quakers or atheists. Dissent was punishable by banishment because dissenters were seen as a fundamental threat to the social order, an evil that could not be tolerated. 

Our 18th Century First Amendment was a revolutionary change, pun intended, but now, it seems that student protesters want to take us back to the 17th where certain utterances (should I invoke witchcraft, apropos of Puritans and Halloween?) have the power to cause harm at a distance. 

I've been paying attention to this trend, and I think there is a distinction between people working pragmatically on social justice issues and those for whom these issues have become a campaign for moral purity, a campaign that, among other objectives, purports to ferret out secret heresies in the words of the others.

Activists with rational strategies know that they don't need everyone to agree with them to achieve their goals. Puritans cannot tolerate non-believers.

Fascism at Yale | The Harvard Law Record,mer_mer,"I'm actually very surprised that I'm getting pushback on this. A university hires professors on the basis that they are serious scholars that can be trusted by their students. Research and opinions of these scholars are implicitly and explicitly endorsed by the university. Think of all the headlines that say ""Yale researchers have found..."" and barely mention the people who actually did the work. 

Unfounded, overtly racist remarks would be cause to call a scholar's reasoning abilities into question, and to rescind the university's endorsement of their research. This is particularly true of this instance, where the professor in question is a sociologist, and issues of race are directly related to their research.

As an aside, as a Jew, I find this accusation of some sort of superiority complex specific to Judaism to be misplaced. Every religion involves a good deal of hubris to explain how they somehow have answers that no one else has. Judaism has this ""chosen people"" line, but most modern Jews (if they are even religious) see this as more of a responsibility or contract than an inherent superiority. For instance, unlike most other religions, Jews believe that it is basically harder for Jews to ""get into heaven"" than non-Jews. Jews must uphold all of the religious laws, while non-Jews only have to be good people.

So, I think you misunderstand me.

Concern Trolling on r/Yale,jaxsson98,"Several reasons.

1. Calhoun College was established in 1933 while Yale was renamed in ~1716.

2. Calhoun was a controversial namesake from the beginning given Yale’s history through the Civil War. The main funder of the college system was Sterling, a Civil War veteran, and the only college he didn’t fund was Calhoun.

3. The name Yale University is so detached from Eli Yale that renaming it does not fundamentally alter public perceptions or commemorations of Eli Yale. He has no statues on campus, his abominable portrait was removed from the YCBA, and his name only comes up in campus in passing in the fight song, the description of some teams as “sons of Eli,” and the decreasingly popular term for a Yale student as an Eli, which is now being superseded by Yalie.

That is not to say the university should ignore the problem or remain static. His legacy should be loudly and publicly confronted and denounced even as it is understood that the name should remain. It is a simple an uncomfortable fact of American and world history that most powerful and important people in the past were deeply flawed and at best participated in horrific structures and practices of repression and violence while being personally opposed. At worst they enthusiastically engaged and strengthened such structures. However, Yale University does not now function as a commemoration to Eli Yale and the name Yale has taken on an entirely new and powerful meaning as a result of the university.",42,,False,ftqv8ti,True,False,1591915425.0,2020-06-11 17:43:45

We're still learning. As President Salovey noted in his announcement, Calhoun remained a name for eighty-six years.

Admissions megathread,TeenageDeveloper19,"Do I accept my Yale interview offer?  


A couple days ago, I received an e-mail from a Yale alum offering an interview. I never thought I’d actually get one (I know Yale “interviews as many applicant as possible”, but I figured with as many people they have applying I wouldn’t have to worry about it). I’m caught between accepting and respectfully declining the offer because of my unique background.

After I left the 8th grade, my father wouldn’t allow me to attend school (long story, but imagine him as an alcoholic anti-vaxxer). I stayed at home and took on various responsibilities, like doing the cooking, cleaning, and budgeting. I didn’t complete a formal homeschool program, rather I studied independently from textbooks and online college courses (edX and that sort of thing). I never had the opportunity to participate in the community (clubs, sports, etc), as my father wouldn’t have it.

I’m worried that I would show up to the interview and seem boring. Unlike almost every other applicant, I have no grades, AP exams, community service, extracurriculars, awards, etc. I didn’t publish my own book, or build homes for the homeless, or play on the basketball team, or join math club, or write for the school newspaper. I haven’t even hung out with people close to my own age since middle school. Every day of the last 4 years has been spent at home working or studying. The only thing I enjoyed was the nights I spent reading, watching lectures, and learning about new and interesting things.

I know Yale interviews are closed file, so I can just imagine a question like “how have you contributed to your community”, or one of the many other very open ended questions they ask popping up and I have to answer every one by explaining I’ve been literally locked in my home for the last 4 years. And if I spend the entire interview talking about my shit life, it’s going to turn dark and negative.

What am I even going to talk about? Nothing really interesting has happened to me in years.

I think it might be a good opportunity to explain my situation better and show maturity, but it might go down the tube if I have nothing to talk about.

Do I accept the offer? What do I say?

I know there are some Yale alumni interviewers on here. What are your suggestions?

I wish the interview was open-file, such that they would know beforehand about my past and not come away underwhelmed, expecting to here stories of all the amazing (or at least semi interesting) things i’ve done and reasons I should be admitted.

I know I could hack it, I know I could do amazing things, I know I have the academics down. I just don’t know how to show it. I’ve done nothing to prove myself, not because I didn’t try, but because I couldn’t.",5,,False,fdjj30x,False,False,1578473135.0,2020-01-08 02:45:35

STATS

STANDARDIZED TESTING

took the SAT in 7th grade with no prep, got a 1160/1600

took the PSAT 8/9 last October, got a 1270/1440 (640 math, 630 ebrw)

i am interested in pursuing biochemistry. i have good grades in science (98 average rn)

not a lot of ec's are offered at my school, but i love baking and hope to start a club where we would raise funds through a bake sale periodically and then use those funds to make baked goods for homeless shelters, etc.

my school also does not offer AP sciences, so i plan on self studying AP Bio and AP Chem in sophmore and junior year, respectively!

Admissions megathread,,"Who gets an interview really varies from alumni association to alumni association--it's the chapter that decides how to dole out interviews.  In some chapters, every applicant gets interviewed.  In others, just a few applications are pulled for interviewing.  Also, in some cases, the interviewer doesn't respond to the request right away...so if some of you are out there worried because you haven't gotten asked for an interview, there are a lot of factors involved and it might not mean anything at all.  That said, if someone does email you to set up an interview *get on it right away*--don't make your interviewer wait.  Bad first impression.
Interviews are conversations.  Some interviewers are better at this than others.  The idea is to put a human face on your application: see who you are, what it's like to talk to you, how broad your interests are, what gets you excited, that kind of thing.  You might get asked some questions about your high school, you might get asked about a time you failed and how you handled it (that one is stolen from job interviews), you might be asked about what you are studying in school (what are your current classes and what are you learning in them), you'll probably be asked what you like to do for fun.

I think a program like Politics, Law, and Economics which is more competitive might have more people attending.

In terms of helping to get in, the college students helping the program said they write a small blurb about each student that admissions would look at only as an additional reference point if there were on the fence.

YYGS is just an (AWESOME) summer program but it doesn't boost your profile TeRribLY much. But, no rejects. So maybe that's something 🤷‍♀️. 

Note: Sandy Chang, who is a professor and (was) an AO at Yale, told us during a meeting with him that YYGS does help and boosts our chances 3x. I don't believe him 😂😂.

1. Yalies had a great balance between working hard and making time for friends and hobbies. People (my friends at least) were not competitive with others, but rather with themselves and with the big questions in their subject areas. 
2. Yalies love the exchange of ideas. I learned probably as much in late night talks over Main Garden Chinese food and stromboli from Aladdin Crown Pizza as I did in classes. I had a friend who was working on an AIDS vaccine, one who taught me enough music theory that I aced my theory classes as a Humanities major, etc.
3. Yalies are funny, nerdy, and self-deprecating.

Admissions megathread,YellowDistrict,"It's great that you're already thinking about college; that being said, don't stress too much about what particular ECs you should be doing to help improve your chances. The best ECs are ones that are meaningful to you and that you have proven you're willing to stick with. If your school doesn't have that many, look for some outside of school, or start your own. I would highly recommend against hand-picking ECs that you think colleges want to see; the ECs that colleges ""want"" to see are the ones you want to participate in. Just do what interests you even a little bit, and stay committed to your activities.

Your test scores don't mean much since you got them so early, but it should be your goal to have the scores you want by the end of junior year. For biochem this means SAT/ACT and SAT subject tests in Math 2 and Chem/Bio.

Your plan to self-study bio and chem will NOT be easy; I would suggest looking into dual-enrollment programs at a local university, or even consulting the non-AP science teachers at your school to see if they can be of any help. Colleges can see a profile of your school to see what APs are available to you, so they will understand if your school has restricted your ability to take them.

If you are ABSOLUTELY set on biochem for a major, then look into some research or shadowing opportunities during your summers. If you are even a little hesitant about biochem, though, keep your options open. You don't want to put yourself in a mindset freshman year that you will later regret.

Admissions megathread,,"Applying early is not likely to hurt your chances. I say this based on my experiences as an applicant, student, and most recently as an admissions volunteer. Applying early tells Yale you are very likely to accept an offer, and that's appealing. Also, if you are not admitted early you may be waitlisted, meaning you will be considered with the larger pool of applicants as well. That said, plenty of excellent early candidates are rejected in the first phase of admissions due to the extremely low acceptance rates, but this applies to the regular pool, too. You do not get rejected outright in round one if Yale thinks you are a viable candidate, so there's not a room of admissions officers sitting in a room saying ""reject everyone who we don't like in the context of this smaller round of applicants!"" It's more like ""who are we sure about right now and who do we want to think about a little more?"" There is no magical formula for getting in, but applying early is not a negative. Who knows? What if you do get in and don't have to apply anywhere else? [I am not an admissions officer. While I stand by this advice I cannot guarantee that there are not more qualified sources.

In the meantime, let the interviewer be unless you have an important logistical question. FYI, when you arrange the interview make it very clear that this is your top priority and you will leave school or practice or whatever early just to suit your interviewer's needs.
Also: expect the interview to last at least a half an hour. Some interviewers conduct longer interviews. That's a personal choice on their part and not a reflection on you (usually). Basically, don't worry if you talk for an hour or for a half an hour. One is not better than the other. Do make sure your transit options allow you to stay for more than a half an hour.

One more piece of advice: stay positive. Don't spin off into explanations of bad grades or how much you hate your English class.

Admissions Megathread (Fall 2019 intake),heatedxstock,"Hello, 
I am very interested in transferring to Yale from UConn. Currently I am a sophomore in UConn’s school of business. I currently hold a 3.9 GPA, volunteered a whole summer at a hospital, won an academic scholarship from a paper I wrote, was the captain of my lacrosse team in high school and work a decent job in my field of study. My sat scores were mediocre, because I didn’t take them too seriously. I expect my GPA at Uconn to rise quite close to 4.0 this semester, because I’m breezing through it.

My main questions are: 

1) What are my odds of getting accepted as a full time student.

2) What are my odds of getting accepted for summer classes alone?

3) Do you think there will be a sense of leniency since I’m a university student that has already proven academic success in my first two years of study?",1,,False,ei522rt,False,False,1552141646.0,2019-03-09 08:27:26

Admissions Megathread (Fall 2019 intake),Arboretum7,Alumni interviewer here. I’m glad you had such a great experience! One of our most important goals is to leave every interviewee with a positive feeling about the school. I don’t think sending an email would hurt but I’d advise against it as Yale admissions won’t have much ability to act on a good or bad interviewer as they don’t have a direct connection with us. We’re managed at the local level. Basically admission sends the local manager a list of people that need interviews and the local manager doles them out to us. They keep feeding us interviewees as we have time for them and we can either accept or reject the assignments. Better interviewers don’t get more interviews or accolades.

Admissions Megathread (Fall 2019 intake),,"Most people seemed happy. I certainly was. Comparatively speaking, my impression is that Yale is a happier place than most of its peer institutions.

As an undergrad visiting Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia––and now as an alum with many friends who went to those schools––I was always struck by how much less happy they seemed on average. My impression is that Brown students are about as happy as Yalies, if not slightly happier. 

One of the best things about Yale is that social life is decentralized. People make friends in clubs, classes, residential colleges, greek life, athletics, art programs, research labs, and so on...it's not like Dartmouth, where most of the ""cool"" people are all in the top frats and sororities, or Princeton, where you have to get into an eating club Sophomore year in order to have ""mainstream"" social life. Sure, Yale has societies, but many of the most popular and well-known people on campus aren't in them, and they're generally not a big deal.

Of course, this is a biased, anecdotal opinion and should be taken with several grains of salt. ",9,,False,eg45d8b,False,False,1549748984.0,2019-02-09 15:49:44

A Black Yale Student Was Reported To Campus Police For Napping In Her Dorm,teknos1s,"I have a hard time seeing the objectivity in your analysis of the police behavior. It seems you are applying the benefit of hindsight to the situation, a benefit the police were not privy to.


The police receive a call from a student claiming there is a trespasser in the dorm. 


The police respond to the call and go into the situation agnostic. The police calmly question the subject who the call was towards. The police also question the caller. They do this in a calm manner. You seem to view being questioned about a situation as ""being treated like a criminal"". However, the more objective and reasonable view is that it is simply discovery, and getting a lay of the land. Remember, they went into this situation blind. They do not know either person. They question both and are serving as mediators and assessing the situation. You cannot assess without questioning. She could either truly be a trespasser, or she could not. And give equal credence to both possibilities. You have to find out by questioning (to which they found minimal resistance to, but remain calm)


At this moment in time the police do not know whether or not the call was legitimate or not. The lady claims she is a student and has every right to be there. Taking a persons word for it, is not sufficient police work (its not as though humans do not lie, and imagine if every police encounter ended with the person simply saying they arent committing a crime and the cops should just leave) 


The lady opened her dorm room. This is a positive step the police seem to appreciate. One could reasonably say that was sufficient enough evidence to prove she is not trespassing (though i disagree, as did the police. However, i can see how a reasonable person could see this as sufficient). Though there are many legitmate reasons why this may not be sufficient proof for some. Perhaps its a friends dorm whom she was given a key to, and in fact not her dorm? Perhaps she found the keys outside and thats how she gained entry in the first place? Again, you cannot operate with the benefit hindsight (in this case, knowing she was in fact a student). The establishment of identification is a reasonable and civilized manner to end the situation. The lady provided the identification and the situation ended in a peaceful and calm manner. 


All in all both the lady and the police handled it reasonably well. The only villain is the caller ",14,,1525984203.0,dyrucp9,False,False,1525983013.0,2018-05-10 15:10:13

If the person called the assumption is that caller believes the person is not supposed to be there.

>I'm really curious to hear a recording of the call if there is one. 

I would presume any call to the 911 or to the normal police number would be recorded.

I would think, but don't know, the call would be some permutation of this:

*Caller: I'm in building XYZ and there's a person passed

Okay that's fair. I immediately zoned in on the reasonableness thing, but as far as getting her any kind fine or charge for her call is next to impossible, and for the reason you stated. And I have nothing against that in the abstract because people shouldn't be afraid to call the cops if something suspicious is going on.

I just can't even entertain the notion that she acted reasonably though. And for her to understand that, she does need a discussion at the very least...public shaming at the worst (which now she has to potentially face since she's getting her 15 minutes of notoriety). 

With all the news going on, that woman can't be totally oblivious to the way police-black interactions can potentially go. What may have been just a couple minutes of her life to make that call cost Siyonbola that much more time to work on her paper in dealing with the cops and could've potentially cost her much more. 

That woman was being much more than a mere asshat. A student sleeping is not suspicious, it's not threatening, and it's not an emergency. She could have asked her who she was, talked to an RA, even sent word to campus security, but she jumped all of that to go to the cops. She's deserved her spot among all the other trending news stories of white people calling the cops for things they have no good reason for.

It's not your fault, but you're deprived of context that is available to Yale students. There is active discussion on this topic in internal Yale facebook groups, as you might imagine, and the consensus is that YPD mishandled the situation. To your earlier point about the supervisor, all YPD are issued this device called a radio that was invented about 150 years ago. It allows the officers on the scene to inform the supervisor of what had happened and what information they already had, which they did not do, and which would have precluded the supervisor from aggressively questioning the student regarding information that had already been determined.

Yale IDs have two dates on them: the student's birth date, and the date the ID was issued. The YPD officers inexplicably assumed that one of those dates was the expiration date of the ID, which is baffling since if it is truly a matter of course for YPD to ask for Yale IDs to determine student status/residence, this is something very basic that they should thoroughly understand. This implies one or both of the following: that the officers were not approaching the situation ""agnostically"" as you say and were instead assuming that she was a trespasser with a fake/expired ID, and that the officers were very poorly trained and could not tell you what information is actually supposed to be on the Yale ID that they requested.

Furthermore, you said the only villain is the caller. Why did YPD not ask the caller for her Yale ID as well to verify that she is in a legitimate position, as a Yale student/resident, to call the police on another person in the first place? Why did they give her the benefit of the doubt and let her walk away?

Lastly, this is not an isolated incident - YPD have a history of misconduct. A couple years ago, a YPD officer drew his gun on a black student as he was exiting the main campus library (a very safe area in central campus, mind you) while searching for a reported burglary suspect who matched his description. This was a totally unnecessary escalation of force directed toward a compliant, unarmed student that easily could have resulted in tragic consequences.

I did not come in here to argue, and I hope my original statement in regards to people within the Yale community and my praise for them in handling a difficult situation did not come across as so. 

From the video evidence, and from what I have learned of the situation, i respectfully disagree that YPD mishandled the situation. And I would assume the Yale community is not monolithic in thought in feeling one way or another. And I assume you know this to be true as well.

>To your earlier point about the supervisor, all YPD are issued this device called a radio that was invented about 150 years ago. It allows the officers on the scene to inform the supervisor of what had happened and what information they already had, which they did not do, and which would have precluded the supervisor from aggressively questioning the student regarding information that had already been determined.

Overlooking the tone of argument for time being, the supervisor seemed to have already been on scene but in a different room (notice where he entered from), likely questioning the caller. It makes little sense to radio someone in another room, and certainly when they are actively involved in discovery. I do not think he was being aggressive in any way (a bit annoyed, yes). But I am a little uninterested in that analysis because it is a matter of perspective.

In regards to her Yale ID. From what I've read, the officers were having difficulty cross referencing her ID due to a clerical issue with that data base because her name was spelled differently. The female officer asked her ""do you know whats going on with your Yale ID?"" because they could not locate her in the database. The supervisor asks ""whats going on with her Yale ID?"" and the female officer says ""its coming back expired"" (I assume this was in fact incorrect, it wasn't actually expired, rather they could not find her in the system due to the name difference - and she simply assumed it was expired). The female officer says there's a date on there and it would have to be the exp date or the date that she got it. The Student admits she does not know either. You question why YPD would not know what the date was for, a similar question could be asked to the very owner of the ID. And while they could not cross reference the student in the database, they gave her the benefit of the doubt that it was in fact still valid because she still had access to the building with it. The officers did approach the situation agnostically. Part of a true agnostic approach is to question the subject of the call, and to question the caller. Both occurred, and once the ID was given and verified (with some trouble due to systems errors) the officers left. A non-agnostic situation would be immediate removal of the student without discussion, or a charge of fake identification and then removal subsequent to the ID being issued (a true presumption of guilt). You are taking a line of questioning as a presumption of guilt, when in fact, it is simply a  discovery process


Do we know that the caller was not asked for her ID? I am ignorant to that fact, and I do not know one way or another. But lets say she wasn't, for arguments sake. A reasonable person could understand why the caller of a trespassing issue would not be question if they were themselves in fact, a trespasser. Never the less, it would be behoove the police to ask her for her ID as well, and I hope they did - and if they did not, i personally think that is an error of judgement. But I do know they questioned the caller for sure, what those questions were: i do not know. It is interesting that they questioned the caller and you frame the aftermath as ""letting her walk away"" but when they question the subject of the call you frame it as a form of harassment (when in fact, they also ""let her walk away""). But yes, the subject of the call WAS harassed. Though, it was not by YPD. Rather, it was by the caller. Who used the YPD who are bound by duty to take the accusation seriously, as her weapon. 

Just like no individual should bear the burden of his or her group, these specific officers should not bear the burden of other officers past behaviors. In order to keep society civil we must fight to treat each and every one as individuals. The past behavior of YPD is not the past behavior of these specific officers. If you could provide and display a pattern of bad behavior by these officers, then that could play consideration.

A Black Yale Student Was Reported To Campus Police For Napping In Her Dorm,teknos1s,">FOH with that false equivalency. It's literally the YPD's job to know that info if they're using it to verify people. Saying ""well the student didn't know either"" in no way logically absolves the police of not knowing how to do their job.

Ignoring tone of argument (once more) I do agree the officers have more of a duty to know the ID's well. Though my argument was not to set a sense of equivalency, it was to show that perhaps it is not a well known issue overall as evidenced by everyone's ignorance. I do understand how one may see my statements as so though, I do agree my wording was ill thought out. 

I am genuinely curious, what are the sources for the fact that we know she was not asked for ID? I'll reiterate i think the officers are behooved to do so. Though I can see how a reasonable person may understand why the caller of a trespassing issue would not be under discovery for trespassing themselves. 

We do not have video evidence of the other person being questioned, may I ask what metric you are judging the unequal treatment? 

Again, If i have emotional statements such as derogatory language, or take part in ad hominem attacks, please let me know.

A Black Yale Student Was Reported To Campus Police For Napping In Her Dorm,teknos1s,"You don't need to be sorry - not at all. This is actually something i value in conversation, and thank you for your input. I can see your point - and it makes total sense. 

However, to be impersonal and to be detached is the very essence in impartiality and objectivity. I think you need it to critically analyze a situation. (I am in no way claiming i am 100% at this but i try to be as much as possible). 

Perhaps I could reconsider certain phrasing to drive my points home better - and if i accomplish that ill have you to thank

though I had to admit, I am utterly disinterested in personal experiences, feelings, and truths, as a metric or tool in understanding objective reality, and universal truths. (That is not to say personal experiences and feelings don't matter. They do. But not in the context of finding objective truth in a situation)


I fear the trend of ""my truth"" and ""my feelings"" and ""my experiences"" has creeped in far too deep into public discord when people try to find out what really occurred in a given situation. And that, i think, is why the nation is so divided. everyone has different personal truths and perspectives, its too subjective. We need more detached impartiality, even when/if it makes us uncomfortable

I'm a current econ undergrad at UCLA. I've been looking into a few different schools for a masters, but I'm really gunning for Yale. 


My situation is a little different, though. I am graduating 2 years early. I came into UCLA with junior standing because of CC and AP credits, and the econ major at UCLA is fairly short (about 16 classes total). I don't know if this will be detrimental, since I am only 19 and therefore don't have a ton of life experience. I do have some work experience in more formal settings, like a property tax assessors office, law firm, and at the UCLA dean's office.


I guess I just want to gauge my chances of a masters degree at Yale, given that I am on the younger side. Any tips are much appreciated.

Admissions Megathread,5yearoldenergy,"Before considering double majoring, I'd take a look at the credits required for each major first! BME is a heavy credit-load (about 19 credits including prerequisites iirc?) and you need 36 credits (1 credit \~ 1 class) to graduate. This number of courses is normally split into thirds - 12 creds for your major, 12 creds for distributional requirements, and 12 for exploration and electives. From a quick google search, EE is about 17 credits beyond prereqs, which already total to 26 credits out of the 36 required to graduate. There might be some overlap in coursework and prerequisites, BUT it'll be a struggle - especially when you factor in distributional requirements into the equation. 

I'd reach out to the DUS (Director of Undergrad Studies) for each major, but if you really have your heart set on double majoring, you'd have to plan from the beginning and there wouldn't be a lot of flexibility, for which Yale is notorious. And remember, it's okay not to double major!

Examples of HSHM courses being taught this upcoming semester include ""Politics of Reproduction"", ""Healthcare and Incarceration in US History"", ""Healthcare for the Urban Poor"", and ""Historical Perspectives on Global Health"". Most courses in the major will look somewhat similar to these four.

One factor that may be relevant to you (and IMO explains the somewhat small size of the major) is that most students with a genuine interest in health or medicine-related topics are premed, and since premed comes with a set of required classes (chemistry, bio, biochem, etc.), it's just convenient to choose a major that your premed requirements will count towards, such as Molecular, Cellular, & Developmental Biology. Majoring in HSHM while premed would require you to take the ~10 premed requirements on top of the major requirements, leaving you with limited room for a double major or exploration of other academic interests. As a result, HSHM is really best suited for two distinct groups of people:

* Non-premeds with a strong interest in working in global health or related policy realms (if this is you, definitely check out the Global Health concentration and/or the 5 year M.P.H programs - https://medicine.yale.edu/yigh/students/)

Admissions Megathread,Yale_Astrophysics,"I’m a PhD student who went elsewhere for undergrad.

Yale is fantastic for physics and astronomy. The classes will take you on a wonderful adventure through the cosmos and you will have a great time. In terms of optimizing employability and exciting coursework, Physics is the best option.

Want to go to grad school? Go here and you will get to work with professors at the top of their field. After you get settled in (not your first semester), you will have dozens of research projects to choose from where you can expand mankind’s understanding of subatomic particles, dark matter, and the evolution of galaxies. Your recommendation letters will be highly effective - the extra factor that gets you into your top choice, assuming you do well in courses and work hard to make new discoveries in research. 

Want to get a high paying job? Physicists are mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers, and data analysts wrapped into one. While this breadth is slightly challenging when competing with pure EE/ME/CS majors, you shouldn’t have any trouble finding a good job. Plus, it is excellent for fields like data science or consulting, and coming from Yale you can even find your way into finance/banking. Moreover, if you do decide to get a MS or PhD in another subject, a physics degree from Yale can easily get you into graduate school in any discipline (chemistry, math, engineering, computer science, business - you name it), whereas the reverse is not true (it is exceptionally hard to get into a physics/astronomy PhD without a prior degree in the field). All this opportunity *and* your classes were way more fun than your EE/ME/CS peers.

I have seen the weird opinion online that Yale is weak in STEM. That is simply absurd. While it may be ranked slightly below its traditional peers like Harvard, Princeton, MIT, and Stanford, it is usually listed in the top 10 out of >750 US colleges that award physics bachelor degrees. You would be very lucky to go here. That said, if you don’t get in that’s fine too. I got in for a PhD after all, and you likely haven’t heard of my undergrad. But I had to get a near perfect GPA and work as a researcher for a year after my BS to be considered equal to my peers who went to fancy schools. So definitely go now if you can.

Admissions Megathread,Circepig,"As TreeOfFinches said, the recommendation letters that will carry weight will come from your teachers and mentors (responsible adults who have supervised or worked with you in an academic or intensive extracurricular setting: a scientist whose lab you've interned in, a coach if you spend a lot of time playing a sport or a teacher or director or conductor if you're a musician or dancer or heavily involved in theatre, a businessperson or community leader who was involved in an Eagle Scout/other community service project or for whose organization you did a lot of volunteer work). ~~I'd go further and suggest that all but one of your letters should be from a teacher~~ \[*see edit below*\]. Remember that you're trying to communicate to the admissions office that you can 1) excel in some pretty high-powered academics and 2) make a real, sustained contribution to some aspect of Yale's community and extracurriculars. If you're excellent at history, a letter from your history teacher might help. But unless she has taught you or supervised you herself, it's not clear why you would want a letter from your teacher's spouse.

In general, Yale isn't looking for well-rounded individuals who excel in every single aspect of academic and extracurricular life as it is for a well-rounded *class*, full of people who each excel at something in addition to being generally academically strong. You don't need to be equally brilliant at every academic discipline and a leader in three completely different extracurriculars. You do need to show that you are outstanding in some subjects and that you have invested heavily in at least one of your extracurricular activities, whether that's a musical instrument or volunteer service or a competitive project for science fairs.

Edited to clarify: Yale currently requires two letters from high school teachers and one from your high school guidance counselor. Most successful applicants will stop there. But Yale does have a provision for supplementary recommendations from the kinds of mentors I've described, which can be found here:

[https://admissions.yale.edu/supplementary](https://admissions.yale.edu/supplementary)

Admissions Megathread,Circepig,"Not really. What matters in a letter is authority and evidence. Does the person writing the letter have firsthand knowledge of the qualities/experiences/abilities she's describing in you, and the expertise or experience to assess them accurately? And does the resulting letter communicate those qualities/experiences/abilities through detailed examples and a clear, knowledgeable assessment? (You may be familiar with the advice to ""show, not tell"" when writing. This applies to recommendation letters too!)

Let's say that one of your principal extracurricular activities is playing the violin. You take lessons, you play in a selective youth orchestra, you play in the pit for your high school's musicals. You haven't hit soloist status, but you're working hard and have moved up several chairs during your time in the orchestra. You really love certain violin concertos; you listen to recordings and discuss them with your teacher or the orchestra's conductor.  A letter from your teacher or conductor can speak with authority and experience to your ability as a violinst, your love of music, your commitment to developing your skills as much as possible. All of this is useful information for the admissions office. But a letter from someone--alum or not--who doesn't have the professional standing to give an expert assessment of your ability and achievement, and who hasn't been present for those years of study and practice, isn't very useful. How can the admissions officer who reads that letter rely on the writer's judgment?

At best, a letter from an alum \*who is a major donor\* might get the admissions office to give your application a slightly closer look, out of courtesy more than anything else. But unless the alum has the authority and evidence to write a good letter as described above--in which case it wouldn't matter whether the writer were an alum or not--the resulting letter won't carry much weight.",3,,False,fs9p28v,False,False,1590806855.0,2020-05-29 21:47:35

Also, I don't get why so many people are hung up on Ford's inability to remember the owner and location of the house where it happened. I certainly don't remember the time, location, and ownership of every house party I've ever been to, and I can't imagine how unimportant those details would become when you're traumatized by sexual assault. Also, new allegations are emerging about Kavanaugh from his time here at Yale, so it seems like we might be establishing a pattern. ""Innocent until proven guilty"" applies to the justice system, and of course Kavanaugh isn't under arrest or anything of the sort. Surely we can tap the brakes on his confirmation until we understand this situation better, and if you look at what actual Democrats (not randos on Facebook) are saying, you'll find that all they want is time to address this before blindly confirming him for completely partisan reasons.",41,,False,e6l0wpd,False,False,1537837201.0,2018-09-24 20:00:01
"My thoughts, as a Democrat, on the Kavanaugh situation.",airbornemint,"The thumbs up/down on Kavanaugh is a very small part of this. Sure, it's a very important and the most visible part of this, but that's beside the point.

Other questions that are a part of this are:

 * In what ways are victims of sexual assault / harassment systemically disincentivized from reporting? What can we do to change that?
 * How do we respond to reports of sexual assault and sexual harassment?
 * How do we treat victims of sexual assault / harassment in private? How do we treat them in public?

If you assume that at one point in time we live in a world in which victims are publicly shamed, reporting is disincentivized, and assault is swept under the rug (which we do, or at least did), and if you further assume that at another point we live in a world in which none of those are the case (which I think we can all agree is the world we want to live in), then I can't think of any way to get from point A to point B that doesn't involve some instances in which ""stale"" sexual assault is brought up against powerful people. That doesn't mean that it shouldn't be brought up, because the only way we get to point B is if it is, and if we — through that process — change how we respond to reports of sexual harassment.

So, you may argue that you want to live in a world in which this accusation against Kavanaugh is brought up in a different way (for example, maybe you want it to be brought up in a more timely manner). I wouldn't disagree. But we don't live in that world; we live in a transitional world, and if we want to continue the transition in that direction, I think we need to concede that the transition will be messy — because the only way to avoid messiness is to maintain the structure in which one party is automatically silenced, and one party is automatically exonerated.",24,,False,e6kotog,False,False,1537825881.0,2018-09-24 16:51:21

This is why it's imperative the FBI investigate the allegations. It must not be based on one woman's word, but it must be investigated and cleared up if it can be. 

As it stands, this is a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the US at a time when medical advances making it possible (and soon ""normal"") to live to 90 or 100 years of age.

It's not about ruining his career. It's about maintaining the integrity of the court and the trust the American people have in it (which has already eroded with all the partisan decisions). Kavanaugh needs be cleared by a thorough investigation or step down to preserve that trust.

A large portion of the population (potentially even a majority) find the accusation credible. Perhaps because approximately [1 in 4](https://www.nsopw.gov/en/education/factsstatistics/) girls is sexually abused before the age of 18 and approximately [1 in 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11476659) female high school students report being physically and/or sexually abused by a dating partner (and those are the ones who *report* it– many never do).

There are lots of potential candidates without this kind of cloud hanging over them. They need to pick one who can stand up to a background check and/or investigation of charges.

"My thoughts, as a Democrat, on the Kavanaugh situation.",danwin,"I agree that sexual misconduct has become more of a priority, but that doesn’t necessarily follow that this has emboldened people to make outright fabrications.

I agree that this isn’t an open-and-shut case, virtually nine of these situations ever are. Senator Feinstein is being critiqued for not making this info known earlier (though I’m not sure what she could have done given the victim’s request). But IIRC, she sent the letter back in July, as the Kavanaugh confirmation process was beginning. What is supposed to be suspicious about that?

If I had to guess, the victim may have not wanted to go public at all, other than to tell her Representative and Senator that she thinks Kavanaugh should be opposed given her personal experience. Perhaps she hoped Kavanaugh would lose the confirmation for some other reason, which would spare her from having to go public as a victim. I guess that would mean she’d be relieved as long as Kavanaugh didn’t make it to SCOTUS. That doesn’t make her claim a political stunt; it reflects the reality of how helpless and stigmatized the victims feel.

Look at how long it took for the Catholic Church, Penn State, and Larry Nassar victims took to come forward even though those cases involved much less ambiguous situations (e.g. child rape) and even had witnesses. If Ford really experienced what she did — an attempted rape in a closed room — I don’t blame her for being skeptical that anyone would believe her, now or then.",2,,False,e6n75k9,False,False,1537922260.0,2018-09-25 19:37:40

You also notably have only responded to people who generally agree with you or other low-hanging fruit, and none of the other longer, more well-thought out responses including the more important parts of the comment above:

>""Innocent until proven guilty"" applies to the justice system, and of course Kavanaugh isn't under arrest or anything of the sort. Surely we can tap the brakes on his confirmation until we understand this situation better, and if you look at what actual Democrats (not randos on Facebook) are saying, you'll find that all they want is time to address this before blindly confirming him for completely partisan reasons.

You acknowledge in another comment that ""yes he should be investigated"" but mostly you just keep beating at the strawman of ""his career is about to be ruined by these accusations."" Not being confirmed to SCOTUS and having to go back to being a federal judge is not a career ruined. Nobody is calling for Kavanaugh to be publicly drawn and quartered. 

The force and urgency of those declaring that they believe Dr. Ford or stand with Dr. Ford is a response to the Senate GOP trying desperately to ram through Kavanaugh's confirmation *before these claims can be properly investigated* (especially with additional allegations from other women coming out), not a desire to see Kavanaugh being punished prior to any investigation.

As to the actual credibility of Ford's and Ramirez's claims - I do find them believable, though I agree that they are not provable beyond a reasonable doubt. When I was an undergrad, I thought much the same way you did, and sometimes had bitter conversations with other male friends about how it seemed like a false accusation, or next-morning regret following a drunken encounter, could unjustly screw you over especially with the UWC's opaque process. Hell, one of my friends and fraternity brothers was actually falsely accused and expelled because of it ([Yale recently just settled with him](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/01/17/yale-reaches-settlement-with-expelled-student/)).

Why do I still believe Ford and Ramirez? Why does my friend whose life was actually significantly ruined by being expelled, also still recognize that his case was in the tiny minority and the vast majority of women's sexual assault allegations have significant basis and credibility?

I would suggest that you try to talk to female friends, classmates who you are close to and trust, and see if they will talk to you about their experiences. I think you would be shocked at how many episodes of harassment or outright assault just about every college-age woman has experienced.

And then think about what incentive they would have to lie to you or make shit up. This is the part that really affected how I think about sexual assault allegations (which are so polarizing and difficult to untangle precisely because it's so hard to prove either way whether a specific allegation occurred or not). You're a smart kid - and especially if you're an econ/stats/STEM major - think about the cost-benefit for these women in voicing the allegations. Christine Ford was immediately deluged with death threats and had to move out of her house. What is far more likely - that Ford and Ramirez both just love fearing for their lives and the lives of their families by telling lies, or that Kavanaugh did drunkenly cross a line on several occasions and that his victims want people to know about what he did before he receives a lifetime appointment to the nation's highest court?

Edit: if it means anything to you, Ramirez's allegation was reported by Ronan Farrow, who won a Pulitzer this year for his meticulous journalism that actually brought down the careers of Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonves. Weinstein was actually recorded by the NYPD doing his dirty deeds, but I'm curious about your thoughts on Moonves, or Matt Lauer, or Louis CK, or Mario Batali, and I guess the entire #MeToo movement at this point - **very few of these cases had any ""hard evidence"" as well** (again, as in most sexual assault cases) - do you think that all these are doubtful as well?",4,,1537898268.0,e6mf2oj,False,False,1537897659.0,2018-09-25 12:47:39

What’s it like to going to school in Connecticut?,spocks_bowlcut,"First of all congrats! I’m a first year from TX. Some state location things:
1. weather— might be a significant temperature change for you. Welcome to having real, distinct seasons. I didn’t own any sweaters, scarves, or a winter coat before college. Budget for this, it can get expensive if you’re not careful. Also, its doesn’t storm here like it did in a more southern place, it basically drizzles but doesn’t really rain, no thunderstorms. Waterproof shoes and coat are a must. 
2. social culture— personally, I do think the east coast has a more distant interpersonal culture. People are more apt to just leave you alone in public, smiling at strangers is less common, etc. However, you won’t be interacting with mostly people raised in CT, the vast majority of your social sphere will probably be Yale itself, which has its own character and social norms. 
3. east coast proximity— Coming from TX, and knowing others from the South, the east coast is gonna be more interconnected than you’re used to. Going to NYC is simple. Any club that travels can go to RI, MA, NJ, NY etc very easily, some go out of state every weekend. 
4. politics— Don’t know anything about you personally, and of course the American South is in no way a monolith, but Yale swings liberal, neoliberal to democratic socialist it seems for most students, just as most colleges are more left leaning. Also there tends to be some shitting on the South, sometimes as bigoted/ignorant, people do overemphasize the coasts and tend to imagine everywhere else as less important or interesting. 
Feel free to DM me also if you have questions about Yale :)",32,,1585319728.0,flner85,False,False,1585316967.0,2020-03-27 08:49:27
What’s it like to going to school in Connecticut?,zaerino,"For reference I'm a sophomore from Tennessee. Also first-gen, and low-income

Weather: Winter is longer and colder. I'm used to cold and snow a few times per winter, and have always done well with layers. In CT, you will definitely want an ACTUAL winter coat, bc at least for me layers won't cut it. You also do a lot of inside <-> outside on campus, so you wanna be able to remove/put on warm stuff fast.

Transportation: You don't want or need a car on campus, it's too expensive and hardly used. You can walk between farthest points on campus in about 20 min, but typically commute is 10min walk. I've greatly benefitted from a skateboard (scooter works too), bc the time adds up. Also allows me to go back and forth to visit friends much easier. Plus, it's just super fun.

Culture: Yale's student body is the best part about the school. I'm used to next to no ethnic or ideological diversity at home, and have absolutely loved the variety of ppl and experiences at Yale. Some ppl have mentioned northerners being more cold or less social - I've noticed no difference (different story in NYC, but NYC is its own beast, and also comparatively HUGE).

Managing Work: You'll have coursework, extracurriculars, meals, friendships, relationships, downtime, possibly a job, a lab, etc. All this can quickly become overwhelming if you let it. I've learned the only thing that allows me to be happy and relatively stress free at Yale is scheduling nearly everything, including downtime. It keeps you from constantly thinking about what you need to do, reducing needless stress. It also ensures you make time for family, friends, and yourself (also, SLEEP, it makes everything better).


Social: In my experience the majority of students I've talked to are open and friendly. I feel like I could befriend around 80% of ppl I meet quite easily. The problem becomes that yalies have limited free time, so making deep friendships can be difficult. My best advice is look into student groups. Many ppl think extracurriculars should be future-focused and career relevant, otherwise they're non-essential. Don't feed into this mentality. Their best use is getting to know ppl in a smaller group through a mutually enjoyed activity. Communities I'm a part of and like...

-FGLI, QuestBridge, FLY, FSY: all groups relating to first gen/low income. They're all extremely welcoming and chill groups. Very tight knit community but also very open to new folk

-Yale Buddhist Sangha: No need to be Buddhist (most ppl aren't). We have meditation stuff on Tu/Th. Great environment to find close friends, the tea+mochi chat time on Th especially encourages this. Generally ppl with very open mindsets, can easily say hi to anyone and get to know them. The shrine is a stunning physical space. Also, most clutch job on campus: become a ""worker bee"" for the chaplain's office, one of the positions is staffing the shrine.

-Yale Outdoors: Do nature-y things, if you're into that. The real magic is going on trips and getting to know the small group you're with. We do weekly dinners on Monday that are super easy to drop in to and see what we're about.

Enjoy the book I just wrote, hope it helps you in some regard haha. Ofc DM with any questions or just for conversation, and I'm happy to meet on campus if you're interested (and we can ever return :'( )",6,,False,floffkg,False,False,1585337266.0,2020-03-27 14:27:46

What’s it like to going to school in Connecticut?,EgoSumAbbas,"I actually really love going to school in New Haven. I feel like it gets too bad of a reputation.

it's definitely not too small, and there are cheap 2-hour trains leaving for New York City every 20 minutes, so it's far from out of the way. there are good restaurants, parks and plenty to do. it's definitely not too big, though, which is a benefit, since i know plenty of people going to college in NYC that say that their colleges have no cohesive campus life since everyone's always all over the city.

that being said, Yale has a really uncomfortable relationship with new haven. a lot of students have the idea that the city is too lame, too small, or too sketchy, so they don't leave campus very much. this, combined with the fact that the student population is pretty wealthy and pretty white, whereas the city itself is fairly poor and more diverse, leads to plenty of tension. just don't be that guy. enjoy new haven for the awesome things it can be, while recognizing that some parts of it are dangerous, and be conscious of how yale is seen by the city",1,,False,fm3haqq,False,False,1585723503.0,2020-04-01 01:45:03

This is a good list. I will say the undergraduate population here does skew towards where the places you might expect: New York, Mass, a good number of CA people, but you can find people from everywhere. I'll emphasize that number four is absolutely a thing. If you stay in the northeast and especially if you have an accent, you'll be doing uphill work against some ingrained beliefs people have. It's not always easy, but I think it's just as important for you to have a varied experience as it is for them to see intelligent people from the South in their classes. 

Likewise, I wouldn't assume every person from the northeast has left-leaning views, and you'll certainly find that CT and even New Haven has some conservative leanings, though Yale itself certainly leans left. As the previous poster said, the student body leans more democratic socialist but the administration and often the professoriate can be rather neoliberal and/or moderate.",12,,False,flnjang,False,False,1585319788.0,2020-03-27 09:36:28

I don't feel my college experience was enriched by having musicians play in the orchestra or from more New England prep school graduates than people of color (I actually think my experience could have been enriched with *more* POC). So I don't think Yale should give preference to a musician or to kids from New England prep schools. Ultimately though, you have to give preference to some people over other people.

> Former Penn men's basketball star and coach [Jerome Allen testified ](https://www.thedp.com/article/2018/10/jerome-allen-pleads-guilty-bribery-penn-mens-basketball-coach-esformes-scandal-celtics)on March 8 in Miami federal court that he received thousands of dollars in bribes from Philip Esformes. Allen claimed Esformes offered him more than $74,000 to list his son, current Wharton senior Morris Esformes, as a recruited basketball player in order to guarantee Morris' admission to Penn. He pleaded guilty in October 2018. 

&#x200B;

[https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/03/ivy-league-college-admissions-bribery-justice-department-jerome-allen](https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/03/ivy-league-college-admissions-bribery-justice-department-jerome-allen)

&#x200B;

[https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article227841064.html](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article227841064.html)

&#x200B;

 

Esformes told Singer that his son, Morris, a senior at Hebrew Academy in Miami Beach, scored 2000 out of 2400 on the three-part SAT exam — but he needed to take the college-entrance test again that March to boost his chances for Penn.

“Very good for starter,” Singer noted.

“2100 is what gets u in all?” Esformes asked.

“As a regular student 2200+,” Singer responded.  


Then he added: “Athlete at least 700 across the broad.”

Esformes texted that he would get back to the college consultant based in Newport Beach, California. It’s unclear how Esformes and Singer continued their discussions about the son’s bid to get into Penn, of if they did at all, because the text messages filed in the court record revealed nothing more.

In the end, their interaction became a moot point. Allen, the Penn coach, followed through on his promise to put Esformes’ son on his “recruited basketball player” list in exchange for bribes so that he could be accepted into the prestigious university in the fall of 2015. But by then, Allen had been fired for having string of lousy seasons. And, the son, never made the team. Still, Morris Esformes is expected to graduate with the class of 2019 this spring, according to his father’s defense attorneys.

&#x200B;

 

**“He was going to give me money if I made sure his son was going to play Division I basketball and get him into the Wharton School,” Allen testified.**

* There are incredible opportunities for traveling (I went to six different countries, some through classes).

'24 admit who only ever hears the good things so....What do you hate AND love about yale?,DeathByYandere1116,"Current sophomore here -- I'm seeing a lot of negativity in other people's posts and, while I don't want to deny or dismiss other people's experiences, I will say that my time at Yale has been overwhelmingly positive.

* **EXTRACURRICULARS**:
I do a lot of singing on campus (a cappella, church choir) and feel like I can speak through a singing lens about the EC exclusivity that others are talking about. There is exclusivity in the sense that people at Yale are incredibly talented, and it might be hard to join Glee or an a cappella group if you haven't sung at all before (though I have friends who have managed to do both!). However, this doesn't mean there isn't room for you to try out new things. There are plenty of low-stakes/no audition singing groups that sound great, for instance, like the church choirs or the East Asian language a cappella groups, but you might have to put in a little more work to seek them out.
I can't speak for senior societies too much, but from what I've heard from upperclassman friends you just have to know people who are already in... so yes, there's some exclusivity there. I don't personally plan to involve myself in societies when the time comes.
* **INCLUSIVITY**: I am a minority from a large, suburban public high school. While there is undoubtedly a wealth/privilege culture at Yale, I've found that most people are very tongue-in-cheek aware of this and are conscientious enough to take this into account when they interact with others. I'm currently working at a student publication that has been known in the past for having ""that magnet school vibe""; in recent years, they've taken steps to be more open and actively inviting to people of different backgrounds, and it's become one of the on-campus spaces I feel most comfortable in.
* **FRIENDLINESS**:
I went into college cripplingly shy and a social potato. Though I am still very much a social potato, I am lucky to have a bunch of friends who are fine with that! They're from all walks of life and are incredibly kind, talented, and conscientious people. Yale people in general are easy to strike up conversations with; I'm not quite brave enough to approach random people in the dining hall, but would be extremely comfortable asking to sit for a meal beside someone I'd just met in class or greeted in passing once before.

Hate:

* **DATING** is difficult haha. I think this is a college thing, and an everyone-being-busy-and-overworked thing, and also part of that perfectionist Yale mindset -- there was a YDN article last year that put it well, that people are in such linearly progress-focused mindsets that deep relationships, which have unclear outcomes, are difficult to commit to.
* on **DIVERSITY** and **CLIQUES**: While I'm lucky to have a diverse friend group through how my extracurriculars panned out my first year, I do see why this doesn't happen for some people. I wouldn't let this stop you from coming to Yale, though, since I've found that these social structures are unfortunately present to some extent / more prevalent in basically all the other colleges of similar wealth and caliber. I would only say that finding the social spaces you want at Yale, like anywhere else, requires you to be proactive and maybe a little extroverted from time to time.
* I do feel there is some **DISCONNECT W/ THE ADMINISTRATION** and the students. I won't go too into detail since you can find a lot of this online, but Yale's treatment of ER&M as well as the East Asian language departments that aren't Chinese has been really sucky.
* bit of a tangent but the **INTRO STEM** courses really don't do it for me. They could be actually fun if they were better taught... Also, in no world does Gen Chem lab's workload correspond to 0.5 credits, it's the most out of any of my classes by far. (CS50 was pretty great though.)

I had a really hard time adjusting to Yale. Everything is very segregated and as a mixed kid, it was hard to feel accepted into any singular group, imo. 

In my opinion, I also think it’s hard to socialize unless you join extracurriculars. I haven’t had any experiences getting close with people in my classes unless I’d known them previously (as acquaintances or even through my ECs). I guess you can party and socialize that way too, but it wasn’t my thing.

You can’t live with people from different years or outside of your res college unless you move off-campus with them. This is frustrating for me because most of my friends are first-years in another college, so I have no choice but to find other people to live with.

Love:
I think Yale is a collaborative environment. There are pockets of competition, but overall I think the environment is much better than Harvard, MIT, or UChicago.

Yale has SO MANY opportunities and different groups of people to become friends with. You could literally reinvent yourself on campus if you liked, although it might take some time to make that adjustment.

Most of the professors I have had genuinely care about their students and work. I have loved learning from them.

There is a strong idea of mentorship at Yale. I think many students are able to find a mentor while here. I have done so through my lab and it has been a wonderful experience.

Lab and research opportunities are endless. If you reach out, you will find a position somewhere, even if it may not be your first choice.",8,,False,fjyta1d,False,False,1583704116.0,2020-03-08 16:48:36

Yale is much more comfortable if you went to Andover/Exeter/Magnet School versus if you were valedictorian of your local high school. Those private schools are feeders, so they're coming in with a network of people they already know. They're more rigorous academically and athletically, so you'll be able to perform better when you get to Yale. Additionally, if you went to those schools, you probably have more money. That means things like international trips and extracurriculars happen with less friction. You can study abroad instead of getting a job for a summer.

Yale pays more attention to those types of people, and doesn't do as good a job at helping lower-income students navigate it. While I went to a very good high school, my girlfriend did not. She struggled much more than I did as a result.

I agree with the advice to either go to campus (most classes except for labs will be remote) or take a year off.  But...

The online seminars and lectures will be as good (or better) as in person, but the labs  and music/art classes will not be as good (of course).

"Can someone explain the whole ""Halloween email"" scandal? Is it the situation really that ridiculous or was it just dealt with it inappropriately?",,"The Intercultural Affairs committee sent the student body an email over Halloween asking us to think about the impact of wearing racist costumes.

This prompted the associate master of Silliman college (one of the residential colleges Yale is sub-divided into) to write her own email to her residential college students telling the that she personally didn't think that the administration should be releasing guidelines on how we should dress ourselves, implying it was brushing on a freedom of speech issue.

Unfortunately, the second email was released during a few days of tense racial discussion, because one of our frats was accused last week of barring black girls from entering a party they were throwing, kicking off general unrest from the minority population over what they believe to be racial discrimination at Yale.  The complaints amount to more than just being barred from a party; the party was the straw that broke the camel's back.

The second email consequently incurred a lot of backlash from the student body, some of whom believe the associate master who sent it cares more about some hypothetical threat to free speech than the well-being of blacks and women.

So then on Thursday, the master of Silliman college, the email-writer's husband and the man in charge of the social well-being of the students in Silliman, got into a discussion with students who were in the courtyard chalking messages of support for minority students on the pathways.  This conversation turned into an argument quickly, with the students accusing the master of not doing his job by refusing to apologize for defending his wife's email.
 
That's probably the the least politicized way I can explain what happened.

Personal opinion time --

The associate master's email was in no way dismissive of racial issues, and certainly didn't invite the vitriol now being thrown at the writer.

You've probably seen the video of the Yale student screaming at the master.  That was, in my opinion, where things got out of line.  The students turned a discussion into a mob, demanding that the master apologize for something that his wife did, and were generally incredibly rude about it.  I recall in particular one girl saying ""Are you going to apologize? Because if not, I can just leave.""  You can disagree with the master all you like -- please do -- but when you start cussing the man out in the courtyard, and pretending that the only thing worth hearing from your political opponents is an apology, you've gone too far.

So I suppose the answer to your question is that no, the situation really isn't that ridiculous, but it was dealt with inappropriately.",92,,False,cwt3hmt,False,False,1447008655.0,2015-11-08 12:50:55

"Can someone explain the whole ""Halloween email"" scandal? Is it the situation really that ridiculous or was it just dealt with it inappropriately?",,"Thanks for the explanation - I think it's quite comprehensive. As a member of Silliman and as someone who knows the girl in the video, I have to tell people that she's one of the nicest, most levelheaded, most rational people I've met here and one of the reasons I sympathize with the protestors is that I've been trying to understand how this person who I've never heard raise her voice in dozens of interactions could be moved to such anger. I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt because of how honest and rational she's always been in the past.

I met with Nick Christakis today and I can say that the reason students raised their voices in the courtyard was because he was overly defensive toward even the *suggestion* that the timing of a ""oh no my free speech!"" email in response to a mild ""please consider not wearing blackface and perpetuating other racist behaviors"" after actual racial discrimination incidents on campus could be in any way construed as insensitive.

As a last note, the student in the video is under police protection because she has been doxxed and sent death threats, which I 100% believe people on reddit have participated in.

That ~~woman's~~ little girl's outburst is counter productive to a much larger issue and again, if she were to do that in the real world, could face consequences counter productive to what she's actually trying to accomplish.  Better she learn that lesson now than believe she'll actually get change done positively by yelling, cussing, and trying to get anyone who disagrees with her out of the way. 

You yell, yeah people will listen. Millions. But we just see a girl yelling and being disrespectful. The issue has been overshadowed by the showmanship of her response.

Masters are tasked with engaging the social life of each college and looking after student well-being. I'm a member of the college in question and while I don't at this point support the call for their removal, there are legitimate arguments that they have failed in their duties, many of which have not been covered on reddit and other online media. Compared to the Master we had who retired last year, the Christakises have been distant and unengaged from the  college community - it's two months into the school year and I don't know what Erika Christakis looks like, she never engaged with students even before the controversy occurred.

They gave him a list of very concrete things they'd like the university to do, like provide mental health and sexual assault services specific that better cater to students of color, having antiracist discussions for freshman just like the university has consent conversations, etc.

This choice to be loud, protest, and not be silenced has been very positive for black students. This one student who lost control (I think understandably) is a tiny piece of a story that, no matter what people outside campus think, has been a good thing for the campus with a very clear lesson: speak up, don't be silenced. The same thing applies to Black Lives Matter as a whole: people freak out about a few people who, in their opinion, cross a line, but the net result has been that speaking up and protesting has raised awareness across the country of problems of racial injustice and will lead to real change in policing and racial politics. This NEVER would have happened on campus if it weren't for the visibility and influence of BLM, which many people like you said ""was counterproductive to a much larger issue.""

the highlight of freshman year for me (by far) was the social experience (first semester in particular feels like a summer camp), and it would be impossible to recreate anything close to that environment with current social distancing protocols.

as far as academics go, big lecture classes would be perfectly fine to take over Zoom, but some of the popular seminars freshmen tend to take (like English 120) would lose a lot if they were held remotely and without office hours.

if it is not a significant burden on you or your family to support yourself financially, a gap year is the move: it's essentially a ""free"" year that you can invest in yourself and your passions (or get some work experience). you really don't get many of those in life, and I definitely wish I had taken one before coming to Yale.

Incoming Freshman gap year?,anonymousaspirant,"I am a member of the class of 2024 and envy your current situation. Why? Because I'm currently taking a gap year; I've had unique experiences, made new friends, and lost nothing. It's untenable for me to take another year off (i.e defer college two years) so I plan on making the most of this upcoming year. But we must acknowledge that the 2020-2021 school year will be a hollowed-out bare bones simulacrum of the Yale experience. I still wonder how I'm going to socialize, participate in clubs, and enjoy res college traditions without spending 24 hours staring at a screen in my (single) dorm room.  


Deferring college isn't entirely positive -- I'm worried about re-adjusting my brain to write essays and take derivatives -- but I've never met a gap year kid who regrets their decision. Even with the pandemic (especially projecting that the world will open up toward the end of the year) you have a buffet of options: travel, complete a research project, start a youtube channel, catch up on reading, work a local job to earn money, or complete internship to gain experience. Even on the educational front, you won't be missing out. There are excellent online courses (Edx's CS50, The Secret of Life, Khanacademy, etc.) that don't require paying 70 thousand dollars and forfeiting 25% of your ""Bright College Years.""

If you do end up coming to campus in the fall, great. I look forward to meeting you and taking advantage of our circumstances as a class. Am I bummed out to spend spring off-campus? Of course, but I'l find a way to make my year epic. One could gather a group of 10 fellow first-years, find cheap accommodation on a ranch in Montana, take online classes, and craft a semester that embraces the spirit of rugged individualism. Why not?

I think a clear structured plan with timelines and a plan for financial support would have been ideal. 
Let’s say, theoretically, a plan for salary support and animal care expenses for 2 months. It would be great for PIs, postdocs and students. Unfortunately, I personally feel that this was not provided. From what I understand some departments were specifically told to not say we are in closure but instead say ramp-down. It is like Whole Foods telling employees to donate their vacation days to sick employees but not doing anything themselves. I feel companies and institutions that truly value and care for their employees should support them in crucial times. Many people will simply get fired as companies cut their losses.

Also, joining covid bandwagon is predatory practice. Nothing has come of a similar burst of Zika research in the past. This is typical of Universities to ride a popularity wave but we scientists lose respect of public. There is a lot of crap that are not factual that are been bandied around to just get more press time which I find despicable. For example, there are serious exaggeration of case incidence and numbers of severe cases from so called experts and the press. I read that apparently 16 percent of CT population might need hospitalization in Yale Daily News today. In Diamond Princess, there were 3,711 people. Most were tested. 696 were positive. Now this was, due to the situation, probably the highest case incidence. In Hubei out of a population of 59,170,000 there were 65,596 confirmed cases. In neighboring Guangdong, out of 113,460,000 the confirmed cases were 1347. 
80% cases are mild. So where did the 16% of CT population number come from? The risk is certainly real, but it is not so much more important than a number of health and social issues. We should certainly do everything to flatten the curve. Failure to do so caused and is causing unfortunate deaths in Hubei and in Northern Italy. but let’s not define this as the most important life and death issue that supersedes everything else just because it is the flavor of the moment. While we should absolutely put safety first I feel that allowing covid but not other research at this point is not the difference between school and grocery store. It is like choosing Whole Foods over Trader Joe’s. I disagree that covid is more or less important than cancer, cardiovascular disease or other health problems and other social issues as well.",1,,False,fkrg5lf,True,False,1584468215.0,2020-03-17 13:03:35

In my comment, I am not going to get into the nitty gritty debate going on but reading the article and especially the comment section under it prompted a memory. 

I know a pretty prominent psychiatrist who used to work in private schools and colleges and he confided something in me years ago that made me really wary.  

One of the schools he worked for was Wesleyan. While he was working there, providing therapy for students, he came under heavy pressure from college administrators to breach patient confidentiality. 

I gathered from the way he talked about this, he resisted that pressure but he left the impression others didn't and don't.  

This was years ago, so, keep that in mind when I say this:  one of the things they wanted to know about was students who were gay - students he was counseling who were gay. 

Kind of makes you want to look off campus if you need help.  ",2,,1396398047.0,cghreju,False,False,1396397850.0,2014-04-01 19:17:30

What is the protest for at the game?,crazunggoy47,"Sure. I don't pay Yale a dime. I'm a grad student. I produce research value that contributes to giving the school its reputation as a top research university. I stormed the field after I saw what the action was about.

But for undergrads, the point is still not valid (albeit for a less obvious reason). What it boils down to is an argument of the form: ""You don't like some element about X, and yet you participate in X. Therefore, logically you either A: don't ***really*** dislike X, or, B: you should cease participating in X.""

I have three arguments against this.

1. Things can be fundamentally good/positive but still be flawed. There are many things to like about Yale, but it's stance on where it invests its endowment is not one of them.

2. Game theory says that we can only control our individual actions. Therefore, at each juncture, you are faced with a choice: participate in X, or don't participate in X. If you don't participate in X, X will likely still continue on just fine without you; one student is disposable. Therefore the world is not marginally improved by your cessation of X, but you are severely impacted. Consider that in this case, a student who left Yale because they disagree with its endowment policies would then 2a: not be in a position to influence Yale, and, 2b: would either have to not attend college (hindering one's ability to help the world), or, 2c: likely attend a different college that is even less receptive to this kind of argument than Yale.

Giving them tuition that they are putting towards negative uses, and then disrupting other people activities just feels disingenuous. Change and consequences for thee and not for me.

If they can’t, then I don’t judge them too harshly for doing what they have to do to make a living. It’s a privileged position to be able to quit your job because you disagree with some element of them. Further, I think it’s unrealistic and unreasonable to expect people to either wholeheartedly agree with their employer/school/what-have-you or else self-immolate in protest. There is a spectrum of activism and the top level comment in this thread disregards the gradations that people rationally use to effect change without sacrificing more than they are willing. 

Re: “they don’t care about it enough for their lives to be significantly impacted...” I suspect that you’d find variation from student to student. Certainly those who submitted to arrest care a lot. But I don’t see anything incongruous between not going “all in” on this action, not leaving yale in protest, and not depriving ones self of the education and institutional opportunities to effect greater change later. 

Re: “moral outrage masturbation.”I can see how one would say this. As someone who joined the protest from the stands, I can attest to the fact that the experience was, to me, at least partially [masturbatory (in the sense of definition #2)](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/masturbatory). I felt years of pent up moral outrage at the indifference of the world power structures about the climate crisis; particularly salient from my own academic institution that has employed and educated me for more than five years. I was aware this was self-indulgent. I enjoyed the experience. But that doesn’t mean it was wrong or not beneficial at accomplishing its goals. Protest is often more powerful when it involves voluntary suffering. But my personal role was not in this spirit. I’m no martyr. Although, again, I acknowledge that 42 students were arrested. To summarize, I see no harm in enjoying the opportunity to protest when the cause is just and there is a plausible benefit to society.",3,,1574616642.0,f8kxu0w,False,False,1574616451.0,2019-11-24 11:27:31

I leave for Yale tomorrow. What advice would you give to your first-year self?,connormxy,"I have no idea who you are, OP, but as you wish. I will be giving some painfully personally specific advice to freshman-me (that might not be all that Yale-specific). Hopefully some helps, but some people might need the exact opposite:

Enjoy the intense experience of developing relationships with amazing new people during Camp Yale, definitely. But try harder to contribute to those relationships after things become less thrilling than the new and bizarre first two weeks of Yale.

You'll meet new people after those first two weeks, too. Might be worth it to try just as hard at developing those new relationships too.

Go to sleep, clean your room, and go to class. Your roommates are also adults trying to live in an Ivy League university and they don't deserve to crawl around your shit. You're going to school. People literally dream of the things that have just become your good day, your average day, and your bad day. Almost all of them are not allowed to sleep in your bed, take your ethics test, go to your bathroom, stay up late in your library, eat your food, or be late to your chem lab. You have been specially permitted to pay a lot of money to get to do those things.

At the same time, people have been doing this for over 300 years, so you're not going through anything someone else hasn't before.

Look up at the ceilings. And the CASTLE ON TOP OF THE LIBRARY. And the gargoyles and every stained glass window and sculpture on and in the buildings. Do some googling and figure out what funny/dated/impressive/horrible/forgotten thing they are commemorating.

Go to a New Haven restaurant or park or anything in the city, sooner rather than later. Yale is awesome and you don't need anything outside of it. New Haven is awesome and you should experience it outside of Yale anyway, for your own good.

Check a book out of the library right away.

You didn't actually learn calculus in high school.

Say yes a lot more when you aren't sure how it's going to work out. You are really badly going to regret most of the opportunities you missed (employment, romantic, academic, experiential) because you were waiting for the perfect internship/date/lab/trip to fall in your lap.

Ask someone out on a date.

Get more involved in the college, in the more official sense. Figure out a way to hang out with your Master and Dean.

People won't choose to go on an adventure with you if they *don't* think you're all right.

Participate in Finals Faeries every time you can, even if you weren't ""supposed to.""  Go to their party, too.

Figure out how to get on the Floating Dance Party list immediately.

Ask for permission from individuals but forgiveness from systems.

Go to the parties and go ahead and have your first drink and then have a drink once in a while. Don't make a big deal out of it. Don't wait until second semester and make it an exciting new part of your life that you overdo. Actually have a drink with your dad before going to college and get it over with now.

You're not that smart, you're not that dumb, you're not that ugly, you're not that hot, you're not that fun, you're not that boring, you're not that weird, you're not that cool, and neither is anyone else. But everyone else is worried about their stuff too. So try to imagine what other people are worried about, realize you have no idea, get over yourself, go try and do hard stuff and fun stuff, and it'll be great.

Don't miss the first meeting of that extracurricular you knew all along you wanted to do most, dummy. And then go to their parties and to their dinners and on their trips once in a while, early on, before you have to break into a tightly knit group later. Don't be a weirdo to people. Then refer to advisements 1 and 2 now that you have some more friends.

**The tl;dr:** These won't be ""the best years of your life"" or something, but every aspect of life will be totally new, for everyone around you, all at the same time, for the only time in your life. Make use of that energy but also respect the effect it has on others and on yourself.

Oh, also,

We few on this little thread are not the people you need.

Search something in college confidential such things as: maximize financial aid need; borderline financial aid; second home; family business financial aid; cash poor; high home value...I think a lot of decent advice will turn up.

But really, you should hire an advisor who knows about this.

There are ways to arrange your family's assets so that you don't look wealthier than you are, and frankly, ways to arrange them so you look less wealthy than you are. 

You are foolish to thinks ""aww shucks, please understand guys, we really do not have much money"" will sway anyone. You need your assests (both [!!]  homes), your parents bank account, their debt (not all debt is valued the same), to tell that story.

It seems like you've done zero research.

You should have learned this two (two-plus really) years ago, so that the accounts and properties  would be in order for your 2018, 2019, 2020 tax returns (maybe even 2017).

I really don't see how you can fix this now. Switching the second home to a ""business"" during or after a first or second appeal will be taken as complete fakery by the financial aid office.

So in hindsight that second home if it actually is a business (I have my doubts), or if it is rather a ""working-the-system-style"" could maybe be be ""considered"" a business, the switching that around should have happened in 2017 or 2018. Your're stuck with it now, and it's a huge red flag. 

So your best hope, IMO, is to push the reduction in income, Covid economic meltdowns angle. But they are rightly gonna come back at you with, ""Oh, you're broke? You don't even *know* broke. We've got families rendered homeless by this crisis. Sell your mother-effing second home, mother effer.""

Also, it looks bad in terms of you ""broke-ness"" that you family sounds to me to go back and fourth between two nations (and I suspect two far away continents - Asia/U.S., am I right?). That is a lot of money it costs to fly back and forth. Broke people do not live in one country and maintain a business in another, in general.

And did you visit Yale in person? More than once?? Did you interview on campus? Did those visits get mentioned in your application?

Let's take it further. Did you attend perhaps a private  boarding high school in the U.S. on full pay? Or an expensive private high school, whether in the U.S. or in your home country? If any of those are the case, they are going again to call bullshit on your request for more financial aid. 

I actually think your family does have the money. I think you are just throwing a net here hoping to save your family many tens of thousands of dollars.

Last, your title is disingenuous. No, Yale does not expect your family to sell your home to attend. But yes, Yale does expect you to sell a *second* home to attend.

"" 

In these elite East Coast schools’ efforts to maintain a white-student majority and keep Asians as a minority, Asian-American students are held to a higher standard than white students, a 2015 Princeton University[ study found](http://www.thedp.com/article/2015/05/race-and-holistic-admissions-affirmative-action-and-asian-american-students).

Penn must not be afraid of — God forbid — white students no longer being the dominating population. Not only is this practice ironically antithetical to values of multiculturalism and diversity, it violates [the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv).

Any law that separates people by race, a “suspect class,” must pass strict scrutiny, the most rigorous form of judicial review, in order to be deemed constitutional. In order to pass strict scrutiny, a law must be “[narrowly tailored to advance a compelling government interest](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/equal_protection).”

Supreme Court precedents prove that affirmative action passes because of the compelling interest of diversity and the lack of other alternatives to achieve diversity targets on campuses.

However, preferring white over Asian students comes nowhere near to satisfying strict scrutiny. The compelling interest of diversity does not stand. Replacing Asian students with white does not increase diversity — 50 percent white plus 20 percent Asian is not in fact more diverse than 35 percent each.'

For me focusing on my college experience was more important. Regarding music, Yale has a few bands, a recording studio, a radio house and a bunch of performance spaces.

Recommendations for how to make friends at Yale as an incoming first year?,_Riis,"Yale provides a huge amount of opportunities to find friends. Your suite is hand-picked, and you'll probably end up getting close to your suitemates. You are also assigned to a froco (freshman counselor) group, essentially a senior leading a bunch of first-years. I think they're generally twenty-five students or so. If you show up at lunch and dinner, they'll also end up as some of your closest buds. Additionally, your residential college in the first place is an amazing outlet to make friends. Res colleges are tight-knit; they encourage eating together, studying together, and doing subsidized activities together -- I went on a laser tag trip and a ski trip with my college, which was a great way to bond with the bois. Finally, extracurricular activities typically rely on people working together and communicating with each other. Like it or not, you will end up finding friends.

Most importantly, just be yourself. You'll fall into your best friendships. Pretty much everybody I've run into at Yale is a decent person. Your interests and major don't really matter. I'm a MechE major. While some of my closest pals are in STEM or share extracurriculars with me, many of my best friends have completely different interests: theater, environmental science, history, polisci.

**My main personal involvements**

- Yale Buddhist Sangha: meets in the shrine under harkness tower Tu/Th (in my top 3 fav places on campus) for meditation workshops and talks. Don't need to be Buddhist, in fact most ppl aren't. There's regulars but also new ppl all the time, anywhere from 5-30 (avg 15) depending on the event. Easiest place for me to just start conversations, especially on Th with the tea+mochi social hour. 

- Yale Outdoors: We lead a variety of outdoorsy trips, accessible to pretty much any physical fitness. Also do more chill social things. There's a group of regulars who go to the weekly meetings on Monday (just talk over dinner), and there always new ppl on trips that we lead.

- Chaplain's office: whether you go for friendship or the ABSOLUTE WEALTH of free snacks, definitely worth visiting at least once. Talk to the aids, they're nice and usually bored and welcome conversation.

"Anyone else feel as though they just don't ""fit"" with the rest of Yale?",yacsayacsa,"I left Yale (undergrad) a few years ago. I was tremendously isolated the entire time I was there. And also (clinically) depressed. I don't know if the depression caused the isolation or vice versa, but it was really probably more of a feedback loop sort of thing. I always had the same feeling you did, about being closer to people from back home where I grew up than to people at Yale / in New Haven. Within about a year of leaving, I had fallen out of contact with all of the people I knew from Yale (not that there were many of them to begin with). The people I knew were great people, don't get me wrong - I just felt like I never really ""fit"" with them.

Academically, things were scarcely better. I absolutely picked the wrong major (I liked the subject in high school, so I figured, hey, that's what I'll do - wrong decision). I didn't end up being fond of the subject matter, and I wasn't very good at it either. Nor did I even know (never mind get along with) most of the people in my year and major, which hardly made things any simpler. I realized during my senior year what I really should've done - but of course, by then, it was too late. 

I feel like my time at Yale was only worthwhile insofar as it got me a foot in the door at my first (real) job. Besides that, it's four years of my life down the drain with nothing to show for it (but hey, at least no student loans!). Kinda makes me feel like an ungrateful bastard, honestly. What kind of person goes to Yale - _Yale_, one of the greatest academic institutions in the world! - and comes out of it feeling like the experience wasn't worth it?

"Not from Yale, but based on what I have seen, isn't the Professor completely right on this?",zahaquiel,"There are two issues that are both defensible, but they're butting heads and it isn't pretty, because there isn't a pretty answer. 

1. These professors are defending free speech, including the ability to say offensive things, or do things like dress offensively on Halloween, within some limits. They argue that those limits should be up for debate, involving students as well as administration, but not outright censuring certain forms of expression. 

2. Some students feel that there is pervasive, systemic racism at Yale, and that the administration isn't doing enough to prevent it and make students feel safe and included in their residential halls (""homes""). There is a long list of problematic instances that some students feel haven't been properly addressed (or addressed at all), and for them the Halloween costume emails looked like another ""deal with it yourself"" remark. This is the side of the issue that hasn't seemed to get as much attention, though overall in my opinion, I think the students have been handling themselves and their arguments regretfully. 

What sorts of limits do you put on free speech, and still maintain a safe and inclusive environment that feels like ""home""? There's no perfect way to do this. Yale (and probably every college) advertises their social environment as some sort of ""home away from home,"" but the rules about offending one another in your parent's home versus at college aren't going to be the same.",12,,False,cwxt3yo,False,False,1447345955.0,2015-11-12 10:32:35

However, it seems that the husband of the woman that wrote the second letter has offered an apology of sorts. This is peculiar because he really didn't have anything to apologize about -- perhaps he was trying to placate a certain group.

The group of students represent anti-intellectualism. Something akin to a philistine -- this is really different to the public's perception of the type of student at Yale. The anti-intellectualism is somewhat hidden by a veneer of pseudo-intellectualism; in this sense, you get the appearance of intellectual thought but it is mostly a misdirection  -- you can get a strong sense of this from the video where the students speaking are posturing. Contrast that with the professor who represents intellectualism.

Now the professor, being an intellectual, sought an open discourse while the group of students, being anti-intellectual, sought to strangle freedom of speech and freedom of expression -- they had an agenda and an expected outcome in mind. The latter usually presents itself with hostility as the underlying problem is one of being inflexible in thought or narrow-mindedness -- not getting your outcome will lend itself to making you mad.

I agree that the first email from the Intercultural Affairs Committee was pretty harmless, but I think some students might have seen it as the administration imposing on free speech and Halloween revelry. Erika Christakis (the assistant residential hallmaster) wrote the second email in response to hearing about these frustrations, implying that the IAC's email might have seemed too formal and administrative (dictatorial? censuring?), and that there shouldn't be so much administrative rule on what's okay and not okay to wear for Halloween.

There's a strong network of Yale transfers there and basically by being outstanding in the community and thus getting those guys to personally vouch for you (they come by and meet community college ppl and do presentations on transferring to Yale) you can get in.

This one particular community college is viewed as a ""safe"" option for choosing transfers by the Dean in charge of the process (she's a really nice lady and interviews pretty gently) since she can check in with her network there and make sure you aite.

Yale really loves its community college transfer students because it gives more legitimacy to their idea/image of ""holistic review."" But, it's very different than entering through the normal avenue in that there's really only one person for you to impress.

Contrary to what some people have written here, **one of the great privileges of a Yale education is that you will almost certainly NOT enter into any kind of debt after four years**. Yale College will go above and beyond to make its education affordable to all accepted students. In my own case, as a first-generation, low-income student, I pay nothing to matriculate at Yale.

Mens haircuts,cazlaaaad,"OP here;

I was desperate for a cut so I decided to go with Phils Barber Shop on Broadway as its close, easy to find and looked cheap. I walked up the stairs to find an old lady sitting in the far corner and she hastily told me to sit down, followed by a question about the weather. This is where some questions rose to mind. Is this old woman Phill? Why isn't Phill here? Is ""Phill"" (the old lady) the only staff member? What if more than one customer wanted a haircut at the same time? 

She then asked me how I could like my hair cut. I explained I wanted it cut around the sides and back with only a little trim on top, hopefully leaving me with my usual style and shouldn't take too long. This is where my problem arose. I had asked for only a little trim off of the top, however I now believe that she thought that I only wanted a little hair LEFT on the top. So basically she cut it all off within 5 minutes. In hindsight, maybe I should have showed her a picture of what is usually looks like and clearly specifying a length, however the past is the past and we can't change that. The main issue is that the present is the present, and the present me has the haircut of a 7 year old.

TLDR; Im now wearing a hat everytime I am in public and will be getting another haircut in two weeks when hopefully I have SOME hair back. I don't blame Phills barber shop, however a warning to anyone who would like a cheap haircut PLEASE SHOW THEM A PICTURE OR BE VERY VERY CLEAR",2,,False,ffp68ze,True,False,1580087284.0,2020-01-26 19:08:04

Yale investigation finds ‘no evidence’ of racism at frat party alleged to have been for ‘white girls only’,puppytao,"I'm white, but I certainly saw it and had it discussed with me by those who experienced it firsthand. I've seen black friends followed by employees in stores in New Haven, and I've certainly seen and even unwittingly participated in racist behavior in terms of letting people in gates and entryways. As a white guy, I pretty much never waited to be let in when I was visiting friends in other colleges and entryways, but I certainly have had black friends who have had to wait because people won't go out of their way to let them in, and if I'm going to be honest with myself, I definitely gave people a second look based on race when letting them into places.

That's just a couple of examples, and I don't recall overtly racist behavior in class, but then again, as a white guy, I wouldn't even have noticed if black students were being singled out to represent black experience or if somebody awkwardly made one of those ""can I touch your hair"" or ""you're so exotic"" comments, but it's absolutely real. If your below comment is accurate and you're black, you would be the first black Yalie I've ever met who never felt any kind of racism on campus.

Yale investigation finds ‘no evidence’ of racism at frat party alleged to have been for ‘white girls only’,yalethrowaway2015,"I graduated in 2015 and I did. Several of my minority friends shared that experience. 

I've noticed over the past couple months that many of the most upvoted comments on /r/Yale are people who have never experienced racism, telling me and my peers that we are lying about our experiences or that we are making too big of a deal out of the racist treatment we receive from our peers, our professors, and the administration.

It's the most hypocritical thing. Instead of considering what we have to say, people act like we're crybabies or tyrants who are trying to shut down anyone who might harm our fragile egos. They're doing exactly what they're accusing us of doing.

I know it's hard for you to understand what it's like to have your TF tell your entire freshman year math section that they ""can tell which students are smart enough to be here,"" and then look straight at you, the only non-white/non-Asian in the room^1, the only one from an inner city public school, and thus the only one who did poorly on the first midterm. (By the way, I got tutoring twice weekly, worked my *ass* off, and got an A in the course after nailing the final.)

I also know it's hard for you to relate to the feeling that a Native American student may feel when they see four sorority girls show up in *full redface*, skin-darkening cream and all, to a Branford Halloween party. Because no one is dressing up as you for Halloween and laughing at the absurdity of their own costume. It's hard to empathize with that Native American student's experience when your daily existence isn't filled with reminders of the fact that you and your race amount to a punchline.

It's easy for people who are not judged by the color of their skin or the culture of their upbringing to dismiss this as an opportunity ""to ignore or reject things that trouble you."" It's easy for people to say that when they haven't had to overcome the systemic and race-based poverty that their family has been sunk in for generations. It's easy to say that when they haven't had to deal with people of a certain race putting themselves at the center of every conversation and making every conversation about racism at Yale about whether they and their ""rights to free speech"" are being infringed by students of color who don't want their professors condoning acts of racism. Erika and Nicholas Christakis have never experienced racism -- they can't  tell students of color to accept racism without us exercising our rights of free speech to tell them ""no."" They're allowed to say what they said, and we're allowed to say what we've said.

We worked so hard to get here. We deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect that is afforded to our peers. We shouldn't have to spend our 4 years here defending ourselves and overlooking the ways in which so many people here treat us differently because of our race. All I'm asking for is empathy. I just want people to stop jumping to conclusions and rushing to defend the Yale administration without at least trying to empathize with the students too.

What would you say is different about that compared to how people react to other issues? It seems that most people think that what they care about is more important than what other people care about. They're skeptical of the other side's claims (or don't think they're as meaningful as theirs) and think that what they think is most important is most important.

Yale investigation finds ‘no evidence’ of racism at frat party alleged to have been for ‘white girls only’,hucareshokiesrul,"The Christakises complaints (which I don't think were really justified fwiw) were about the administration's attempt to influence speech, not students using their own speech to challenge others. People were justifiably upset about the very nasty way in which the Christakises were then treated by students and that students sent a list of demands to the president demanding that they resign. There appears to be many students who don't believe they were allowed to say what they did, hence the personal attacks and the attempts to have them fired. 

Conversations about racism has dominated campus lately, and there has been some pushback by white people objecting to what they view as the excessively aggressive nature of many of these ""conversations."" The Christakises appear to have had a good deal of hatefulness directed towards them due to a relatively moderate email expressing skepticism (not hostility or really even outright disagreement) of a Yale email. It's a shame that this detracts from productive discussions about racism, but that doesn't mean it's not a legitimate complaint. It's a politically charged topic and everybody is frustrated about how difficult it is to have productive conversations about it. 

I was a white low income first generation student who hated my time at Yale for a lot of reasons similar to what you described. I know that it's hard to have conversations about class and background. It sucks always worrying about whether what I consider to be a legitimate complaint will be dismissed as whining. I've found the administration is pretty respectful and willing to listen. They often can't or don't do what I want them to, but that's the nature of a large institution with many competing priorities and constituencies. If I want Yale to actually make costly changes to the way it does things, I, like any group trying to make some change, need to convince them of the gravity of my complaints and that they ought to take priority over competing claims to their time and resources. That kinda sucks, but I don't see how it could work any differently. I'm troubled that there appears to be such an us vs them attitude at Yale right now.

&#x200B;

\>Mid-twenties white guy, born in the most middle of middle-class families. No tragic background, but was a fairly mediocre student in HS (2.9GPA) and didn't care about standardized testing (26 ACT, and I stupidly didn't retake it recently because I was told by someone I trusted that colleges virtually never asked transfer students for it and didn't verify that like I should have). 

&#x200B;

\>Joined the Marines out of Highschool, did 5 years enlisted and went through a pretty academically rigorous school for my job. Did one enlistment, I did a few things of note that I included in the part of my application that asked for it, but nothing crazy. Was honorably discharged as a Sergeant, and during my last year enlisted I really started picking up reading as a hobby.

&#x200B;

\>I did a few college classes before getting out last January, I've been at a pretty good school ever since (Top 100 on US News, but pretty low on the top 100). I've gotten 30 credits and a 3.9 GPA thus far.

Has anyone here gone through the Eli Whitney Program? Looking for advice and some answers about the interview process.,EliWhitneyApplicant,"So I have heard some things, take everything with a grain of salt though because I'm definitely still fairly unsure about my standings. 

One, the Wikipedia page for the program states ""In contrast to the traditional student application, an interview is required and granted to only a small number of applicants"". So, evidently the interview request is a good sign, HOWEVER, this is unsourced and I can find no mentions of it in the edit history, so it looks like it was just randomly dropped in there, and I have nothing to back it up.

Two, I've been talking with someone who works with vets to get them enrolled in the best schools possible and he said that one of his people got an acceptance letter from Yale already, but I don't know if that was to Eli Whitney or just general transfer or what. He also said Yale is pretty severe when it comes to credit transfers and that you probably won't know what will transfer until August, simply because it's up to the departments, not admissions.  

Three, and this is actually an edit so READ THIS FOR SURE!

I just found this on Google books and it says that [""If, after reviewing your completed application, the admissions committee judges you to be among what it describes as the 'strongest candidates,"" you will be asked to an interview.

"Yale Tipster in College-Cheating Scandal Bribed a Yale Coach, Source Says",labormarket,"Morrie Tobin, the [Yale dad](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-yale-dad-who-set-off-the-college-admissions-scandal-11552588402?mod=article_inline) who allegedly tipped off federal authorities to what they say is the largest [college-admissions cheating scam](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tip-the-yale-coach-and-the-wire-how-the-college-admissions-scam-unraveled-11552524237?mod=article_inline) they’ve ever prosecuted, wasn’t just an informant. He was also among the parents who participated in the scheme, according to a person familiar with the investigation.

Mr. Tobin, a Los Angeles financier, led authorities to the alleged college-admissions scheme, The Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing people familiar with the investigation. But what hasn’t previously been reported is that Mr. Tobin participated in the scheme by paying a bribe to Rudy Meredith when Mr. Meredith was the head women’s soccer coach at Yale, the person familiar with the investigation said.

&#x200B;

The scam involved paying coaches to designate applicants as potential student-athletes, which would enhance their chances of being admitted, prosecutors said.

It couldn’t be determined which of his daughters Mr. Tobin allegedly paid a bribe for or how much he allegedly paid. One of his daughters graduated from Yale in 2015; two others are students there now, with expected graduation years of 2019 and 2020. The youngest daughter is a high-school senior.

Mr. Tobin was being investigated in an unrelated securities fraud case last year when he told investigators he had a tip for a bigger case they could pursue, according to people familiar with the matter.

Hoping for leniency, Mr. Tobin provided information, the person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Tobin said Mr. Meredith had sought a bribe from him and he had paid, the person said.

&#x200B;

Mr. Tobin’s alleged cooperation led investigators to unspool what they termed a sweeping nationwide scheme. Last week authorities charged some 50 people, including 33 parents who allegedly paid Newport Beach, Calif., [consultant William Rick Singer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-behind-the-alleged-25-million-college-admissions-cheating-scandal-11552422678?mod=article_inline) a total of $25 million between 2011 and 2018 to bribe coaches and get their children into elite schools. Mr. Singer, who pleaded guilty to four charges, said he also arranged for students to boost their SAT and ACT scores by having someone else take or correct the tests.

Mr. Tobin had come to the attention of authorities for an alleged pump-and-dump investment scheme, a scam in which people conspire to inflate the price of a stock so they can unload it at a profit. He agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and one count of securities fraud, according to a plea agreement filed in federal court in November. He is scheduled to be sentenced in June.

Lawyers for Mr. Tobin didn’t respond to requests for comment. Mr. Tobin hasn’t been charged in the college-exam case, according to federal authorities.

 

Mr. Tobin agreed to help authorities by pretending to be interested in paying Mr. Meredith another bribe, according to the person familiar with the investigation. In April 2018, he allegedly met Mr. Meredith in a Boston hotel room, a meeting authorities say was surreptitiously recorded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. At that meeting, Mr. Meredith said he could designate one of Mr. Tobin’s daughters as a soccer recruit in exchange for $450,000, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors.

Mr. Meredith has agreed to plead guilty to two counts related to wire fraud in the case. Prosecutors say Mr. Meredith was linked to Mr. Singer’s scheme but at some point began soliciting bribes himself in exchange for designating [applicants as student-athletes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/colleges-rethink-athletic-special-admissions-in-wake-of-indictments-11552820400?mod=article_inline).

Mr. Meredith, who spent more than two decades as the head coach, resigned from Yale in November, a day before the school received a [federal grand jury subpoena](https://www.wsj.com/articles/yale-was-subpoenaed-in-november-related-to-admissions-cheating-scandal-11552692608?mod=article_inline) asking for information on him.

Yale has said it didn’t know the full details of allegations against Mr. Meredith, or the extent of the investigation, until charges were unsealed last Tuesday.

A lawyer for Mr. Meredith declined to comment Monday afternoon. Yale didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",9,,False,eixi65a,True,False,1553049076.0,2019-03-19 21:31:16

Fenway Park to host Harvard-Yale in 2018,Ziddletwix,"So I'm speaking from ignorance here, so there might be details that I don't know about. But Fenway only has marginally higher capacity than Harvard stadium (30k vs 37k). I mean, I guess 7000 seats is a large number. But the direct cost of that is that it's a stadium which is obviously not suited to football, so acting like each of those seats is equivalent to a seat in a football stadium seems odd.

Obviously, the bigger confusion is more about the tailgate and social scene. Until I hear otherwise, I assume that tailgating will be massively restricted, I mean all there is are those cement parking lots? Again, I don't know any details, just on the surface this doesn't make much sense to me. For most people (students and especially alums, who make up majority of attendees), the social event of the tailgate is the priority, not the football game (at this year's game, you barely saw the tailgating parking lots drain as the game began). So my assumption is that this change will seriously impact the tailgating. The direct benefit seems to be a few more seats, but Fenway is still a remarkably small stadium, and many of those seats will have very poor view of a football game. To me it feels like the biggest draw is just the cache of having it at ""Fenway Park"", but bedsides the cool headline, on paper this seems worse for everyone involved.

\-- Worry more about learning than about the grade you'll get in a class. That applies to organizing your schedule.

How to best take advantage of shopping period?,luigi2yoshi,"For most classes you can just show up and shop without signing up anywhere. However some classes require you to preregister in order to secure a slot ([https://yalecollege.yale.edu/academics/preregistration-applications-and-preference-selection](https://yalecollege.yale.edu/academics/preregistration-applications-and-preference-selection)), which includes freshman seminars. Preregistration isn't binding, you can still drop during shopping period (and even halfway into the semester) if you find you don't like them. Otherwise, you don't have to officially sign and submit your schedule until the end of shopping period, so you have around two weeks to shop for most classes before you're officially enrolled. 

Shopping period can be fun but also tiring depending on how many classes you shop. Most teachers assign work (although it's usually minimal, no papers or anything) during shopping period, so it's best to decide your classes sooner so you're not doing extra work (I think most people usually have it figured out after the first week). 

For most people I recommend exploring the freshman seminars, since a lot of great professors teach them on interesting subjects. But since you're doing DS which is already 3 seminars, you might want to shop around for a lecture or maybe a language or QR credit. You're required to complete two out of QR, WR, and language by the end of freshman year. 

If you're thinking about a potential major (this goes for STEM mostly) you might want to get started on prereqs. You can figure those out here: [http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/majors-in-yale-college/](http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/majors-in-yale-college/). 

Lastly, [coursetable.com](https://coursetable.com) is the most helpful resource you can have during shopping period. Most people just browse for classes there before school and then show up during shopping period. Over time you'll figure out what works for you.

Classes begin as if you're planning to stay, thus you're bound to have homework/assignments due almost immediately, so choose the number of courses wisely. Then as you go along you feel out what you'd like to take vs. what you wouldn't and drop those courses accordingly.

Also, if there is a waiting list and you dont show up to the given class you'll eventually be dropped to allow someone else to have the spot.

How to best take advantage of shopping period?,zaerino,"A lot of people have touched on the big things, but the most valuable part of shopping period I've found is not the obvious topic of choosing between classes, but choosing between sections in the same class. For both my L1 and L2 Spanish I shopped 3 different professors (which is tiresome going to a repeat of the same class), but it was super valuable to tell if the teachers were a good fit for my style of learning and personality. 

Another valuable move is to sit in on classes (mainly lectures here where you don't have to get involved if you don't want) that you have no intention of taking that semester, but just want to see what they're like (a higher level lecture might, say, spark your love of a subject you didn't know about before).

How to best take advantage of shopping period?,Scriptorama,"I have some thoughts as an instructor. Please understand that shopping period at Yale is stressful for us and an aspect of the university that we don't tend to like. If you're shopping a small class, please don't get up and leave during the class (unless you've checked with the instructor first)--it's disruptive even if you're quiet and is discouraging for the person teaching. If you decide to not take a class and you've been attending it for several sessions, you should let the instructor know, especially if it's a class that has a waiting list (as many small classes do)--this saves the instructor some headaches and is a polite practice for your colleagues who are waiting. 

Some have suggested coursetable, which is certainly a resource, but there are some issues and you should be judicious in how you use it (lest you think this is sour grapes, I have a good score on coursetable). Yale is unique in its allowing students access to course evaluations, which are kept internal to departments/colleges at most universities and many/most instructors feel it should be this here. The reason many feel this way is that students tend to write evaluations differently when they know it's for an outward facing site vs. internal evaluation--it's the difference between a comment card at a restaurant versus a Yelp review. In short, evaluations here are often directed to other students rather than to the instructors, which is a problem. Further, study after study has shown that women, people of color, and those with non-standard accents receive lower course evals, and you can seen this borne out in my department on coursetable. This is to say that coursetable is ethically questionable as compared to something like ratemyprof, but if you choose to use it, know that the difference between a 3.7 and a 4.1 may just be a statistical/bias-based anomaly and you should try the course out. 

Finally, don't be afraid to talk to an instructor, especially in a small class. Talk about what your goals are for taking the course and whether the instructor thinks those goals an appropriate fit for the class they're teaching. Even in classes with the same course number, like writing classes, some professors will emphasize content over writing instruction and vice versa--asking how they view the class can give you an idea of what the rest of the semester will be like and allow you to set appropriate expectations.

What’s your favorite part about Yale?,bigleaguechyut,"(I'll leave this here for anyone considering Yale, as I know RD admissions won't be out for some time.)

Honestly what drew me to Yale was a sense of fit and the culture - something that is highly subjective, and is obviously going to vary from person to person. But some of the reasons I chose Yale and have no regrets:

- at Bulldog Days I walked through Phelps Gate and was greeted by someone who, probably for a society thing, was mimicking one of my favorite YouTube videos at the time. I wanted to be at a place where everyone *could* be taken seriously but didn't always want to be.

- that weekend, I set up a meeting with a faculty member because I had not done any science research in high school and I was worried coming to a big school like Yale that it'd be impossible to get involved. The fact that that faculty member, who I later found out was a pretty big deal in his field, took the time out to meet a prospective frosh over something this silly, meant something to me. And yes, later on it became pretty ridiculously easy to join a lab and get involved in research. In fact, through a professor I randomly contacted, I got to work in an incredible lab near my home during the summers which wasn't even affiliated with Yale.

- I love Yale because I met so many different people. Some of whom I may not have clicked with, but some of whom I will be best friends with for life (not hyperbole).

- I love Yale because it *made* me meet so many different people. Say what you will about the residential college system - the fact that my social circle wasn't determined by who I took classes with means that I am super close to so many people I might have otherwise never met if I didn't happen to be living with them for 4 years. Now, I have friends doing anything and everything across the globe.

- I love Yale for Thunderbrunch, for Freshman Olympics, for Spring Fling, for running into Durfee's 5 minutes before my swipe expired, for the walk to Payne Whitney, for 3 hour dinners in the dining hall just hanging out, for late nights in WLH eating Wenzels and learning Orgo, for the trek up icy Science Hill to get to Cell Bio, for overtime hockey wins at the Whale. College is hard, but I wouldn't trade my Yale experience for the world.

You should certainly keep an open mind with any college, and of course I have many friends who would say similarly wonderful things about their schools, and Yale is nowhere near perfect.

At least 47 overdose in New Haven Green,BathingMachine,"Well, in terms of areas to avoid, here's my experience and two cents. 

Most students I know can walk through the green without being harassed, but you might see someone snorting/smoking/injecting something in broad daylight. Anywhere you go downtown you will probably be accosted for money or have drunken nonsense yelled at you. If you're from a city, then this is nothing new -- just ignore them and keep moving. 

If you're living on campus you'll figure out the best places to be, usually East Rock. Grad students often live around New Haven, so we have to be more cautious. Avoid walking around Newhallville, Fair Haven, most of Whalley Avenue (other than Westville), and the Hill neighborhood west of Cedar or south of Amistad. Driving around is usually fine other than chaotic traffic. Yale students are frequently the subject of thefts/assaults in or near these areas, even during the day. Soon you'll get the emails about it. 

New Haven isn't really a safe city but it's improving quite a bit. Homicides are actually pretty low now, I think last year there were only 7. It's thefts/assaults to be cautious of. If you're worried about being yelled at/catcalled, just disabuse yourself of the idea that you can avoid it. I screamed at and called names on a daily basis walking the one block from my parking garage to lab. Generally, I'd just say use common sense. Be with a group, keep aware, don't go into new areas at night, don't talk to strangers if they're giving you a bad vibe, and have some form of protection (i.e. pepper spray).

I'm a white woman and I went to Yale in the early 2000s (when New Haven had a much rougher rep) and am back at least a couple times a year to visit family. When I was a student I don't remember being yelled at much, never felt I was in danger and none of my friends were ever assaulted or mugged. I didn't think the rep was deserved then and it's certainly a lot nicer now.

I lived a block from what's now the Stop & Shop on Whalley one year and my neighbors were all lovely and chatty. My brother takes his toddler to the Green to run around.  They have farmers markets there and a Shake Shack. It's a poorer city for sure, but poverty doesn't necessitate violence or crime and I wish more Yalies saw that and got out of the bubble more. I've lived in several other US cities and I'd say New Haven is on the safer side (For comparison, I'd put it MUCH higher on the list than SF or Seattle).",4,,1534452057.0,e4b0u57,False,False,1534442746.0,2018-08-16 13:05:46

For instance, [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/nyregion/yale-worker-john-c-calhoun-window-slaves.html) pissed me off both because Yale had anything espousing a positive view of Calhoun or slavery in 2016 (Calhoun's political career was built around promoting racist policies, he wasn't just a slaveholder) and because they fired the worker and initially pressed charges. I don't think the same action would have been taken against a student. There's a perception among locals that Yalies are pretentious, out of touch and look down on townies and that's at least partially deserved.

At least 47 overdose in New Haven Green,BathingMachine,"Just more context, since this is a conversation I've had with others in the area: 

A lot of Yale students are well-off, come from good families, and haven't had much difficulty or experienced any poverty of any kind. That isn't me. I've been homeless myself, I've lived dirt-poor for many years and paid my own way through school with grants, loans, and working. I get the sense that a lot of Yalies feel guilty because of how much better they perceive their lives to be than the rest of New Haven, and thus think they can't criticize poor people because they're some untouchable, mystical class. And I agree it would be snobby for them to complain too much if they haven't lived that life. 

I don't feel guilty. I have been dirt poor, living in dirt poor communities. I'd walk miles to go to the laundry mat with clothes and books in a basket on my head, and sit in the Florida heat for hours studying on a folding table while homeless people encouraged me to study hard. The people in FL and NC that I lived around were friendly. Folks in New Haven are uptight assholes. More litter, more dense crime, more disregard for others than any other community I've lived in. And I don't bat an eye pointing that out . Yes there's murder and theft back where I'm from, but people at least leave you alone if you're minding your own. I felt relatively safe in other towns but not here. And it has nothing to do with color, as other users have kindly suggested. ",4,,False,e4bjxle,False,False,1534459299.0,2018-08-16 17:41:39

College was the only time I lived on the east coast, so it was hard to determine if that was a New Haven thing or an northeast thing.

It sounds like it's different now, but one of the reasons I want Yalies to get out to the bubble is that, in my experience, most didn't seem to be aware that they came from ultra wealthy backgrounds. They seemed to think they were middle class or upper middle class at the most, when, at least to me, it was obvious they weren't. I definitely grew up privileged in Seattle, but I was in an inner city, so I was aware of that. I remember going to a girl's house in Greenwich for Thanksgiving and she referred to her family as ""middle class."" And it's like, yeah, if Greenwich were the entire world, that might be true, but.... Point being, people tend to look at what they're surround by when developing a world view.

"Dining hall worker smashes Calhoun stained glass of slaves picking cotton, loses his job.",PhD_sock,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I'm a person of color. I'm not unaware of the difference that imposes on me, existing as I do and navigating American society. I'm also a Yalie (grad student). It's a profoundly flawed institution, which is also a very wonderful institution in many ways. That description, by the way, applies to just about every Western institution of any kind that is of significant age today, simply because we're all aware that these institutions were built on the backs of colonialism and were a direct result of Empire in all its manifestations.

Here's my problem with defending Menafee's action. As a person of color, I have to acknowledge the continued existence of the relics of Empire whether directly (i.e. being a student at Yale, encountering an artwork by a celebrated Western artist that flatly represents a colonial gaze, etc.) or indirectly (i.e. the incredibly embedded racism, xenophobia, sexism that characterizes American society in innumerable ways). I think every person of color has felt one or the other, or both, at some point in their life. 

Vandalism is not the solution. Or, rather, it can be a solution, but it is not an ethically defensible one. You say that the panel's depiction is, itself, the morally indefensible act (in other words). But from what I know, the image in question was that of two black cotton pickers (or farmhands, something similar). It was not an image depicting John Calhoun himself standing over a black person, whip in hand (or something along those lines). In your own analogy, the latter would be equivalent to the pedophilic image; the image actually at issue here is, actually, equivalent to the former.

Black farmhands, cotton pickers, etc. *were the norm at the time* in the way Chinese people were associated with opium dens and port/dock work, Indians with spice trade, hedonistic sexuality, and blasphemous (non-Christian) paganism, and so on. It ""glorifies their subjugation"" only to the extent that it perpetuates an ordinary condition of American society at the time. It glorifies this only in the way that Hergé's Tintin perpetuates European stereotypes of Orientals--that is to say, not a focused, malicious celebration of black slavery or Oriental mystification and conniving, but rather an uncritical upholding of prevalent worldviews.

Stained glass as traditional veneration...taken out of context, you're quite right. But all of Yale's architecture (at least the most picturesque bits of it) is basically an attempt to fake Oxbridge's ambience. Calhoun college is barely a century old, if that. *In context* therefore, I'd counter that the use of stained glass here was not with the intent to venerate anything but simply to continue that ideal of aping Oxbridge.

I didn't live in Calhoun and didn't attend Yale as an undergrad. And I fully agree that CC should be renamed and all that. I never did understand why, precisely, the university decided on naming it thus in the first place.

But those are different issues. Breaking a window is, literally, that. Just because it happens to coincide, at the level of ideology, with valid, current critiques of the building and history that that window forms part of doesn't somehow make that breakage whole. I don't believe Yale should prosecute Menafee beyond firing him for the simple problem of workplace vandalism, but I definitely do not believe in championing his act for misguided reasons.",21,,False,d59yoo7,False,False,1468370184.0,2016-07-12 19:36:24

Friends, don't believe everything that the media says. This blatant false journalism infuriates me and I lost all of my little remaining respect for Fox News and any journalism outlet that would dare to distort a story. Having journalistic experience myself, I know that rule number one is to always have integrity in your write-ups/reporting and the fact that Fox nevertheless blatantly violated this deeply angers me.

Here's the truth (i.e NECESSARY CONTEXT THAT FOX DIDN'T INCLUDE):


Student 1) ""For the record, he led with some stuff about how minorities have a rough time in this country, then his golden phrase of ""Repeal the first amendment"", AND THEN he proposed an alternate amendment that was essentially the first with some words about sensitivity. The video has NO REFERENCE to this alternate he was proposing, or how he sets it up.""


Student 2) ""This video just came to my attention, and my immediate reaction is outrage and frustration. I was asked about this petition and have been included in this video, but what Mr. Horowitz has presented is a blatantly false narrative of what actually occurred. It is clear to me that this is an intentional misrepresentation, with the purpose of advancing a political agenda and narrative. When I was coming out of the dining hall, a friend and I were stopped by this man, who asked if we could spare a few minutes to talk. Both of us being in a rush, didn’t want to engage in a debate, so when he said he wanted to REPEAL THE FIRST AMENDMENT, I had absolutely no interest in being lectured by a crazy man in the middle of reading week and finals. So, thinking he was just a crazy guy with a clipboard and not a man with a camera, I told him, “This is fantastic. I absolutely agree. I don’t agree with your approach however, but I appreciate what you’re doing here. Good luck.” Then I walked away. My hope was that by showing tacit support for his position, he wouldn’t follow me or insist that I stay and debate him.
Now, this is NOT what the video shows. Of course in the video, they have conveniently left out when I said I disagreed with his approach (i.e. to repeal the first amendment…). The editing of the video deliberately misconstrues what happened, and I am positive that Mr. Horowitz is very cognizant of this. In fact, it clearly seems to be his objective: to push his narrative. While I can only speak for myself, I am very compelled to believe that a similar twisting of the truth was done for the 3 second soundbites he has of the other people in this video…. I am disgusted with the way that Horowitz has taken my words and negated my position just so he can rack up the views on a video and bait an audience into believing what he is selling. What I find most upsetting though, is that this video is featured on the FRONT PAGE of Fox News. How dare you, this is not only shameful, but false journalism.""

Finally, with student 2, I have no reason to believe he is lying. He has no agenda he is trying to push, Fox News, however, does. If he truly did believe that the first amendment should be repealed, then why would he make this statement contradicting that ideal? Surely he isn't embarrassed of his opinion to the point of going out of his way to say that he didn't agree with that journalist. He was blurred out in the video as well, so it wasn't as if anybody was going to recognize him. I have ample reason to believe that he made this statement because he is legitimately upset with the journalists of Fox News for skewing his words to fit their agenda.

Incoming freshman premed music major has so many questions and no answers,kozzie1999,"Definitely talk to the DUS of music! She's really helpful.

The music major has a lot of requisite courses so you have to plan out really wisely. Make sure you know music theory well so that you can skip MUSI 110 and possibly 210 (Counterpoints and voice-leading).

fyi: The music major program changed last year that you have to take at least 3 courses each from category I-IV (read [this](http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/music/#text)). Given that you might want to take more than 3 in some categories and that many take lessons for credit each semester, the total credit count could go above 20 credits. This is quite insane given that you only (?) need 36 credits to graduate, but many music majors take over 40 credits thanks to music lessons.

Tips from someone who gave up doubling STEM & Music:

1. try to place out of ""trivial"" prereqs, i.e. L3 & under language courses, MUSI110, MATH112 (115 if possible). Starting Chem with orgo instead of gen chem would also be huge.
2. You can use summer courses to take some premed reqs like physics and maths, or knock out distributional requirements like languages or So.
3. Try taking a category III or IV class each semester. They're seminar classes on music in society and you have to take six of them, so taking one each from sophomore year should be fine.
4. Composition seminar gives you a Writing credit for some reason.
5. Don't go too hard your first semester. Keep the load under 4 credits, 5 if you're taking lessons for credit. many pre-meds throw themselves under the truck their first year by taking sth like 2 science classes, a maths class + a language class.
6. Don't forget to take fun stuffs early like first-year seminars. Honestly if you do most of 1 & 2, then you can leave 3 for later.",3,,False,fxaye0j,False,False,1594208970.0,2020-07-08 06:49:30

How do you rate the possibility that incoming freshman will be asked to begin classes online in case of continued closure?,vakalat,"I think it is very likely that classes will be totally online in the fall, especially for undergrads, or that the semester might be pushed back altogether. It's possible that the grad and professional schools may ask students to come to new haven, and might even have some small classes, but the main reason why colleges are an issue for covid, I believe, is dorms and dining halls. Even if you got rid of large lecture courses for undergrads, I don't see a way around the main issue, which is having large numbers of undergrads living on campus.

There are two reasons why, especially for undergrads, the semester might be pushed back to January completely (this is extremely speculative, though, so take it with a grain of salt).

1. So much of Yale's/other fancy private universities' selling point is 'campus life' - living with people in your college, having freshman counselors, etc., is a big reason why people choose Yale and I think Yale would probably be at least somewhat cautious about denying that to a whole class of undergrads (although they might ultimately be willing to do it given the circumstances).
2. The biggest issue with an entire semester online is time zones. It might be fair for the last few weeks of one semester, but there's no way you can reasonably expect students on the west coast or international students to regularly attend class at 11pm, 2am, 4am, etc. Yale might be accommodating of these students in particular taking gap years, but I dunno.

My best guess is that classes will be completely online for undergrads, with some accommodations for people to take gap years if necessary (time zone issue, inability to get visa, etc), with at most very limited in-person courses for grad/professional students. I think there is a real possibility that the whole semester gets pushed back, but a relatively slim one.",17,,False,fpa5bkh,False,False,1588441115.0,2020-05-02 12:38:35

Environment of Yale Law,zhirzzh,"I went to YLS, and am happy to answer questions, although I frankly think that for law school it makes more sense to look at employment statistics, think about the job you want, and go to the school that will leave you with the least debt while still making that achievable.

The course load can be as rigorous as you want. The first semester has a lot of fairly hard black-letter law, but it is pass fail. If you want you can gun hard to impress professors, but most people don't. After that you can pick your own courses, and take as easy or hard a course load as you want.

I think it is fairly easy to get by with minimal effort, but the type of students who get in don't tend to be the people who naturally do that. A lot of people don't direct their effort into exams though. There are a big contingent who are very focused on clinical work for example.

A classmate was basically working as a public defender during law school, and I think got pretty bad grades (well, a lot of Ps, which is a bad as it normally gets here), because they openly didn't study, since they didn't care about exam scores. They knew exactly what they wanted to do after, and were focused on it.

People are friendly and collaborative. Everyone was always happy to share outlines and stuff.

Yes, people socialize, lol. I think it's about the same as most law schools. People are busy, but it's not like no one has fun.

Environment of Yale Law,emmettbear,"I am a student at YLS and am happy to add my perspective. 

>How rigorous is the course load?

There is no one answer on the rigor of the course load. YLS gives students a ton of freedom, and it's up to students to define this for themselves. I would say that students here seem less stressed about exams and grades than students at other schools. The first semester--which is the only semester with four rigorous ""black letter"" classes--is pass/fail, and nobody ever fails. So the semester is at once rigorous because it has harder classes but extremely casual because there absolutely are no stakes other than perhaps making an impression on your professor. From there, some students will take their academics extremely seriously and take on a super rigorous workload, some students will skate through with minimal effort (some students literally don't even attend classes or live in New Haven their third year. See, e.g., Cory Booker). And most fall somewhere in the middle. I would say that most students seem very invested and busy with classwork, especially clinical work and independent research, but I would also say that there is less academic pressure here because grades matter less here than elsewhere. Because it's a very prestigious degree, and because there is no curve and only a very informal grading system. 

>How friendly are people?

I think most people are extremely friendly. One of the mantras that was drilled into me when I got here is that the most important thing you can do at YLS, especially the first semester, is get to know and befriend your classmates. It's way more important to be a likable person than a superstar student, because these will be your colleagues and professional network for the rest of your career. It's a small school, so most people know each other and interact with each other, so students take it as a serious responsibility, as well as just the more enjoyable thing to do, to be a friendly, approachable, and sociable person. There are a few gunners, for sure, and those people might get good grades, but I think the reputational harm they're doing to themselves by being cutthroat or obnoxious will outweigh any professional boost in the long run. Overall, most people are very down to earth. 

> Is there a collaborative study environment? Do people still have time to enjoy social gatherings?

These factors also lend themselves to a very real sense of collegiality and collaboration here, for sure. Students definitely share notes and outlines very readily, are very encouraging, and most everyone is involved in several collaborative projects. It also means it's a pretty social school, and, yes, I think most people make time for socializing since it's both fun, there's less academic pressure not to, and being part of the network is so important. 

I chose Yale for a few reasons:

* Having a YLS degree opens more professional doors than any other law school, including to ""non-legal"" careers like writing, government, and politics that interest me. 
* It has a much stronger emphasis on social justice/public interest work and public service than most other top schools that steer comparatively more students to high-paying corporate law practice, which doesn't interest me at all. 
* Consequently, it has the most generous loan repayment program, on top of generous need-based aid, so coming here made a ton of financial sense. Total financial security and total job security are a killer combination!
* The student body here seems much more down to earth, friendlier, collegial, etc. than at other schools. That, and the great academic flexibility, truly make law school here less hellish than law school anywhere else. 
* Because it's a small school with enormous resources, there is just endless opportunity here. There's definitely way more to do than you'd ever have the time to. 

Hope this helps, and good luck! My advice is to focus on your GPA right now. Other than having a good LSAT score, having a good GPA is the most important factor in law school admissions. And while you can always take time between college and law school to study on the LSAT, you only have one chance to get a good GPA.

New Haven is, from what I’ve heard, much improved from 30 years ago. Crime doesn’t seem to much of an issue anymore a Food is great and the city is somewhat lively. I’ve heard that the coolest thing is how interconnected the Northeast is: you have NYC, skiing mountains in NH, and so on.

I don’t think Yale is preppy. I understand that one of Yale’s best assets is it’s AWESOME undergraduate community. The university is very undergrad-focused (as opposed to Stanford which is more balanced) from what I’ve seen. Groups are tight and, from what I understand, not clique-y.

The STEM departments are heavily being invested on at Yale, so I think that’s something to consider. Ik CS has grown a lot in the past few years. Something I would consider is that CS is the fourth most popular major at Yale with about 16% of students in the graduating class majoring in it (I believe), where at Stanford CS is the most popular major and like 50% major in it. I think this is relevant if you wanna do symbolic systems.

More on Yale CS: I’ve heard it’s more theoretical which might not be your thing, but apparently they teach the fundamentals and way of approaching problems in a way that you are ready for the ever-changing industry that software engineering is. You can also get a MS in CS if you get A’s on 3/4 of your CS requirements.

On career placements, you are probably right about networks. But you shouldn’t have problems finding a good job coming out of Yale in CS if that’s what you want. In the top 5 CS employers for Yale are Google, Facebook, and Microsoft I believe.

Other cool things: it seems to be really, really easy to get fellowships (STARS, DSA, ISA). Virtual bulldog days was super helpful in introducing these and much more.

Now, Stanford is gorgeous (in a different way). I was there last summer, so PM me if you have questions. I’ll agree that the weather is better. Symbolic Systems is SO cool, and I would probably do it if I went there. Be aware of the floating duck syndrome over there though (google it). And, yeah, I think the ambient is more pre-professional.

TBH, I don’t know where I’d go if I were you, but maybe Stanford simply because they have CCRMA which is a lab I’d love to work in and Symbolic Systems, but you might weight things differently, which is why I wrote this out.

People there are obviously very bright/driven, but they also tend to be socially competent/down to earth in a way that a lot of Yalies are...not. I also found the overall quality of instruction to be much better than what I've experienced here. Still, you should go to Yale—assuming cost of attendance is about the same. Your professional opportunities will be better here, and I'm sure you'll still have a great time—pretty much every undergrad I've met here has had almost nothing but positive things to say about their (overall) Yale experience.

Even if you don't end up liking Yale, I wouldn't recommend transferring to USC. Friendships seem to be much more group-oriented at USC than at Yale, and pretty much all of those groups are formed during your freshman year. It can be pretty hard for new people to break into those circles.

Here is our content policy: [https://librexapp.com/content-policy](https://librexapp.com/content-policy)

We let the community moderate itself. We rely on Yalies to determine what content should stay and what should go.

As a student at Yale, I can tell you in my Global Affairs classes, some of my friends and even professors have been afraid to say what they think about a political situation because of the way they could be judged. We feel that there needs to be a forum at Yale to express alternative points of view. Currently, most Yalies just talk amongst their friends, perpetuating the echo chamber. We hope to give Yalies a place to see what their peers really think about important topics without the stigma.

If you are a Yale student, try the app and you will see that this is not the ""safe space"" you might assume. Many posts in the community have already voiced their support for free speech of all forms (including unpopular views) and for the second amendment.

I'm not a suicide risk, but I've talked to them specifically about at what point they would report such a thing to the school. It sounds like this isn't their first rodeo, and are skilled at judging the degree of risk. Suicidal thoughts aren't uncommon in the mental health world, and they're well aware that having them alone is not *necessarily* grounds for an involuntary committal or telling the school. If you're having suicidal thoughts, even if they seem intense, this does not necessarily mean they'll report you as it turns out there are many steps in between having these thoughts and actually carrying out a successful attempt. They told me that the best thing to do is to enrol in therapy and let them get to know you - this will help them better judge you and not jump the gun.

A suicide attempt is serious, of course, but you should tell them your feelings about - that you were not fully committed. This will let them help you before you do end up doing something more serious, and will let them know that with help you may not pose an imminent risk. Involuntary treatment is only given to those at imminent risk (e.g. you tell them you plan to hurt yourself as soon as the appointment ends, and you have the tools and know how to do it.).

Of course, I can't guarantee or predict what they will do in your case - this is only my understanding from what they told me. I also am not fully familiar with the university's policies.

Good luck! I'm proud of you for getting help. Following u/rockrobot 's advice is exactly what they told me I should do should I ever be in crisis.

Edit: imo, if you're worried the best thing would be just to ask them about their policies at intake - this is what I did.",3,,1543787879.0,eay64w7,False,False,1543782603.0,2018-12-02 14:30:03

So, if your reasons are similar to mine (wanted “normal” move-in experience with parents, don’t want to “do nothing” and die of boredom for two weeks in quarantine, etc.) I would suggest re-thinking your plan; is it truly worth it?

~~PS: not sure what the downvote is for. My understanding is that the way you get around CT’s quarantine requirement if you come in from a state on the restricted list is to bring a recent negative test result with you.~~

PPS: My apologies. It looks like there is an exception, but it is a narrow one, where you can get a test within three days prior to travel to Connecticut, but it only applies to very narrow circumstances, not including returning as a student to college. So, unfortunately, that test would not help OP. It’s spelled out in FAQs 12 and 14 here: https://portal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/travel",1,,1596821005.0,g0n74o5,False,False,1596775778.0,2020-08-06 23:49:38

So you could hypothetically follow those procedures, fill out the CT health form with your Airbnb as your address and then go with the others nearby. The problem is that Yale may not like it if you tell them you are quarantining off campus. So no clue who you’d contact (I start with your dean of HoC if they are replying to emails and you know them) but I’d probably tell them that you at the time of school will already be in the northeast and that you, having already followed quarantine procedures, would like to join with the New Englanders.

I personally wouldn’t go through all the hassle. It shouldn’t be that bad being in a dorm during that time. I will be with many of my friends so it should be pretty fun during the two weeks. I don’t see why an Airbnb which will cost money would be necessary but hey that’s me.

"What sports, if any, is Yale D1 in?",BalboaBaggins,"Are you wondering what the sporting/athletic culture is like in general?

Just to set proper expectations off the bat, Yale doesn't have anywhere near the sports atmosphere or environment of a big D1 football or basketball powerhouse like USC or Ohio State or Florida or Duke.

That being said, there is definitely still a lot of fun to be had supporting Yale sports teams. 

Football: I would say most people don't really care other than the Game vs. Harvard every year, which is attended by just about everyone on campus plus tons of alumni.

Basketball: The Yale team has actually been quite good in recent years, finishing at or near the top of the Ivy League. We've gone to March Madness twice in the past 4 years, upsetting Baylor in the first round in 2016, and were set to go dancing again this year until COVID-19 happened.

Hockey: Probably Yale's strongest overall program in the major sports. We won a national championship in 2013 and the team is generally pretty competitive. Going to hockey games at the Whale is a really fun experience, and that's coming from someone who grew up in latitudes where it never snows.

Other sports like tennis, lacrosse, squash, fencing: these are all ""bougie"" sports that I didn't have much experience with before going to Yale, coming from a middle class background, but it's pretty interesting and fun overall to watch some of these competitions and learn more about them, especially if you have friends on those teams. That's another positive of Yale in regards to athletics - the fact that the student community is so small and tight-knit, along with the residential college format, means that you'll likely be friends and classmates and roommates with  varsity athletes on various teams, which might not be the case at big schools with more cliques and fragmented social groups.",10,,False,fnb11ri,False,False,1586807355.0,2020-04-13 14:49:15

"For those of us who don't go to Yale, what's happened in the aftermath of the Halloween email debacle?",,"I think we're sort of in limbo at the moment.

Right before Thanksgiving, President Salovey announced a list of policy changes the administration would make to improve Yale's racial climate.  These changes included many of the things that the student protesters had been asking for, which in a word could be summed up as recognition.  Specifically, Salovey promised to improve faculty diversity (our difficulty in retaining minority faculty has long been an issue for activists), double the budgets for the campus cultural houses, strengthen the procedures for reporting racial discrimination, offer more courses dealing with under-represented cultures, and reduce the tuition contribution for low-income students (admissions likes to tell people that you can graduate from Yale with no debt thanks to financial aid, but they're not entirely honest).  He also talked about a few other minor things he doesn't personally control, like the names of the residential colleges.

Of course, promises only have value when somebody follows up on them.  I'm personally waiting to see if the administration actually does anything they've said they will -- especially the bit about the student income contribution, because [they've been known to lower the tuition for low-income students and then hike it back up again after those students have graduated when no one will notice.](http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/11/13/making-the-effort/)

I actually just read in the campus newspaper about an hour ago that Erika Christakis, the professor who wrote the Halloween email and whose husband was featured in that video you might have seen with the screaming student, has just recently cancelled the classes she was going to teach next semester, and has essentially abandoned teaching at Yale.  Personally, I think that's a shame, since her classes were quite popular, but it wasn't unexpected with the amount of flak she's taken from the campus.  It's also worth noting that the administration did not kick her or her husband out of their positions as college masters; she stepped down because she chose to do so.

The campus is more or less back to normal at the moment, though there has been a marked increase in student interest in racial issues in general, as far as I can tell.  Student demand for the classes President Salovey mentioned about underrepresented cultures seems high.  I think we've mostly quieted down because a) most people got what they wanted, even the free speech defenders who didn't want the Christakises forced out of their positions and b) finals are coming up so people are forced to focus on school.

Do me a favor and take everything the national media (and reddit, come to think of it) says about this issue with a couple shakes of salt.  They'd have you thinking we've got race riots, or a bunch of leftist fascists running the show, or a bunch of Klansmen in charge, depending on your news rag of choice.  We're a campus full of Americans trying to graduate like every other campus.

TL;DR We're waiting to see if the administration will actually change policy.",12,,False,cxqgj0g,False,False,1449510174.0,2015-12-07 11:42:54

"For those of us who don't go to Yale, what's happened in the aftermath of the Halloween email debacle?",,"It did that for me too.  I'm not sure of the relevance of what I'm about to say, so please bear with me --

I am not fond of the protesters and their tunnel-vision ideology, but I do understand where it comes from.  I can't pretend they showed up from out of the blue.  Many of the demands they made of the administration had been student causes that have been flatly ignored for *years,* and I don't mean blatant SJW nonsense demands like kicking out professors, I mean basic stuff like our strange inability to retain minority faculty and the fact that tuition has been going up every god damn year, which hits poor kids harder for obvious reasons.  This was back when everybody talked civilly.

Then we have to consider the general racial climate in the country right now.  Most of the protesters have seen a good bit of video evidence that suggests the cops are biased and trigger-happy.  Even if one doesn't think the cops actually are racially biased, one can at least see why the minority students think so.  It even happens here.  Earlier this year we had a policeman draw his gun on a black student leaving the library because he was looking for a burglary suspect who matched the student's description.  Again, one can argue the cop was in the right, but it's easy to see how a black guy could draw certain conclusions about the police from that incident.

 I talked with my father about this whole thing over break -- and my dad works as an IT guy, so he's not exactly an out-of-touch academic.  He said that if you try and talk for long enough with no one listening, eventually you'll be mad enough to start yelling ""fuck you.""  Doesn't matter if you're right or wrong; get ignored by your society long enough, and you start giving less credence to society's rules.

This doesn't mean they're justified in trying to give Christakis the boot, nor does it mean the master should have been cussed out, but it does make me hesitant to dismiss them as entitled whiners, you know?",1,,False,cxs6alo,False,False,1449617946.0,2015-12-08 17:39:06
"For those of us who don't go to Yale, what's happened in the aftermath of the Halloween email debacle?",PhD_sock,"(Yale GSAS.) I am far, far more concerned about the fact that star scholars like Lisa Nakamura and Elizabeth Alexander are leaving, that even after Yale revised its tenure policy, we keep losing brilliant younger scholars to other institutions that are simply offering them more. Yale's always been something of a leader in the humanities, and of late it really just has dropped the ball there. Look at the NELC catastrophe. Or the Classics fiasco that is still ongoing (YDN column just last week or so). 

Amidst this, the Halloween stuff happened. I think what happened and the way it unfolded has a great deal to do with, as you said, the general racial climate. Yale has always been a blue blood WASP place, and has dropped that act only very recently (i.e. last few decades). Something like this was going to happen at some point. But like you, I'm really disappointed by some of the demands being tossed around. I'm really disappointed that Erika stepped down (for whatever reason). I don't think striving for a better Yale, a more inclusive, open, supportive Yale is a bad thing, but the way all this has gone down is just really distressing.

I'm a Computer Science undergrad, so I know exactly what you mean when you say the university is not valuing faculty enough.  We've barely got enough people to teach the classes, and the administration keeps giving us band-aids like CS50 and trickles of new professors.

The sad truth is that there is no such thing as a perfect political movement.  They were always going to make some demands that were ridiculous, like kicking out their political enemies.  But the ridiculous demands were not met; all we really got from the administration through this whole thing was a decrease in tuition and increased course offerings on other cultures.

Racial issues, even on this campus, used to be solved with riots.  And I mean *real* riots, the kind where the aftermath looks like a warzone and people get hurt, not the kind that turns into a dance party on Cross Campus, which is frankly adorable.

I'm glad that attention was drawn to the key racial problems; it just sucks that the way things unfolded led to a lot of (mostly ignorant) bad press. But that'll blow away soon.

I think CS50 is an absurdity, to be honest. Yale shouldn't need to import material (coursework/faculty) from anywhere else. I really think we need to get past the faculty ceiling (700? 750?) and invest in hiring across the board. I'm glad the undergraduate tuition load has been reduced, though I've seen criticism there too, but as a graduate student, I have to say I came to Yale because it has one of the best departments in my field. But departments are only as good as their ability to adapt with the times, and unless Yale commits to hiring and actually promoting/retaining faculty (especially of color because that is abysmally under-represented here), we're going to fall behind quite soon.

Question about Math placement for a Chemistry Major,fuzentrix,"MATH 230/231 are incredibly overkill and not required for the chemistry major. They only focus on proof-based math, which you will not encounter at all in the chemistry major. In fact, the only math course required for the chemistry major is MATH 115 (singlevar calc), although I think MATH 120 (multivar calc), MATH 222 (linear algebra) and ENAS 194 (diff eq) are definitely helpful for physical chemistry I and II but not strictly required. MATH 225 is the proof-based linear algebra course and MATH 250 is vector analysis and again, proofs will never show up in the chemistry major so it's completely unnecessary to take these courses unless you are a masochist and very interested in doing proofs for some reason, or have a very advanced math background from high school (e.g. have taken multiple proof-based courses dual-enrolled in college or something along those lines). I would recommend you take Math 120 freshman fall and then either MATH 222 or ENAS 194 your freshman spring to prepare you for taking physical chem sophomore year. However, physical chemistry can be done with just MATH 120 if you're willing to self-study some lin alg and diff eq on your own time during the course.

It is definitely possible to double major in music and chemistry if you're interested. Taking Organic Chem for First Years will clear up a whole year of your schedule and if you're smart with how you plan your courses you can definitely double major. Take the o-chem lab courses along with it if you plan on taking it your first year since it's easier to recall the material when you're doing the lab and the course at the same time.

as for math placement, take 230-231 if you want to learn more about math and you're interested in proofs, but it'll be literally completely useless for your chemistry major. you'll barely learn any computational multivariable calculus whatsoever. and if you don't have experience with proof-based math, the workload might overtake all your other classes. 120 (multi), 222 or 225 (linear), and dif eq would probably be a much better bet. but don't expect to have as much fun there as in 230/231 lol",2,,False,fs0km3z,False,False,1590611201.0,2020-05-27 15:26:41

Question about Math placement for a Chemistry Major,YungCereal,"No idea about chemistry but just a quick point on double majoring in general - you may be better off just having one major you're passionate about and then opting to take courses in another that you're interested in.

This allows you to have more breathing room in your schedule and take a wider variety of classes as opposed to being locked into Chem/Music classes for the most part.

Yale also has a TON of extracurricular music groups that you can join. A lot of my friends were in these. You may have more fun taking the music classes you want to take and joining one of these.

It's definitely doable, but maybe try it out and see--I bet you'll end up finding tons of other courses you'll want to take! This is coming from someone who heavily considered double majoring in CS/East Asian Studies and ended up just doing CS. I don't regret it one bit. I was still actively involved in the Japanese department, held jobs there, and took tons of courses. I just didn't have the pressure of trying to do the major.

I've also found lot of my friends who double-majored often wished they didn't by their senior year. But that's just my cup of tea, feel free to go for it if you know that's what you want to do! Many people love double majoring!

As per organic chemistry as a first year, it is very easy to do. They won’t flat out place you in organic chemistry, but will give you an opportunity to test out. They expect/hope everyone who placed into CHEM 167 to take it and test into first year organic chem. (If you don’t get that placement, it still is doable. I didn’t get that placement and still did well in first year orgo.) As per the test, I didn’t study and my knowledge from AP chem in high school was quite sufficient (I think it’s not a very high standard so they can fill the class/make sure pre-meds who want to get it done with can do so.)

What are your favorite and least favorite things about Yale?,TreeOfFinches,"I was between UChicago and Yale as well!! I’m from the suburbs of Chicago so initially, I was definitely going to UChicago. But I’ll say a couple things that I love about Yale and if you wanna ask about my decision specifically, feel free to DM me or ask on this thread.

1) Yale feels like a pretty collaborative environment. Everyone is pretty busy but generally people are very helpful and I love the vibe of people on campus. 
2) Semester > quarter system honestly any day. The schools with quarter system sell it pretty well, but to be honest I don’t really see the need for a quarter system anymore. It just promotes people taking too many classes for their mental health to handle and makes your workload ridiculous. You’re learning the content of a semester-long course at Yale in fewer weeks. Imo, it makes the classes more difficult than they already are. Also, on this point, I LOVE Yale’s schedule. We get a two week spring break, which is amazingg.
3) The student body is very strong-willed. Some people don’t like this, but I’m glad that the student body is willing to stand up to the administration sometimes. And while the administration sometimes needs the student body to stick up to them, I think of them as more receptive and communicative to our student body than other Ivies and/or pseudo-Ivies. 
4) While the student body is very serious about their studies, I think Yalies have a pretty good social scene. Yale students “study hard and party harder.” Even if you don’t like parties, you’ll find other people who don’t as well. I’m not a partier so I typically have a board game or movie night with a couple friends over the weekend.

Not like:
1) Yale can feel pretty segregated at times due to the wealth gaps in the student body. Other factors for this include the cultural centers, which provide AMAZING support but sometimes means students tend to interact mostly with people within their cultural center. I’m part of La Casa and love that community, but sometimes I wish my experience was more diverse.
2) Administration can be a drag sometimes. We don’t always agree with their decisions and they tend to dodge a lot of their responsibility to the New Haven community. 
3) I don’t feel like there is much of a cohesive school spirit. Most of your pride is tied up in your residential college, which is a lovely system but can feel restricting at times. However, Yale is planning on opening a new common facility for all students this fall to help promote cohesiveness within the student body.",21,,False,flw0us3,False,False,1585536785.0,2020-03-29 21:53:05

Personally, I thought I liked the core at UChicago until I had a better option. To fulfill UChicago’s distribution requirement, you’re forced into strict course sequences (ex. To fulfill a humanities requirement, you have to take a three-quarter sequence of whatever humanities subject you were interested in first quarter). On the other hand, Yale has a more liberal set of requirements. I discovered countless ways I could fulfill the requirements — and ways that were relevant to my major or interests.

What are your favorite and least favorite things about Yale?,TreeOfFinches,"I do get that sense, yeah. Obviously I don’t go to UChicago, so I’m not entirely sure. I don’t think the collaboration thing is because students at UChicago are necessarily cutthroat. I think it’s more that UChicago tends to attract a slightly different type of student than Yale. Imo, Yale attracts a student who is a bit more outgoing than an average UChicago student, so it’s easier to make friends, form study groups, etc, at Yale. This is a generalization, but it’s generally what I see between my experience at Yale and my friends’ experiences at UChicago.

As for the admin — it depends. Every college administration tends to be fairly conservative in terms of budget, local community, etc. We’ve been fighting for better mental health services or to get rid of the student income contribution for years, for example, and it hasn’t really worked out in our favor. It’s hard to quantify just how “bad” they are, but I would say they try to work with students or at least hear us out. They just don’t always give us the answer we’re searching for, which is to be expected.

Once your name gets around that you're good at X, people will be asking you to join their productions. To direct a show you probably need to find a core team of people that want to work with you on it, and then you'll apply to put the show up, and shows are almost always approved as there is an abundance of theater spaces and budget.

There's a huge 'faculty' of people who teach perhaps one course a year. There is basically one acting teacher.

Has anyone here had success in appealing their financial aid award letter?,TreeOfFinches,"Yes, I had success but had originally received aid in the first place.

I would suggest reaching out soon about an appeal. If you received aid from any other Ivies, UChicago, Stanford, or MIT, include this letter in your appeal. My parents were told directly that they won’t match schools if they are not in this “tier,” although I could be missing a couple others. I do know Duke doesn’t count for some reason.

Explain thoroughly how your parent’s assets are utilized and exactly how they have been affected by this pandemic. A couple years ago, when I was first appealing, my family owned two homes, but one of them we had been trying to sell since the recession but to no avail. This helped our appeal because the house was less of an investment and more of a money-suck for my family. (Ninja edit: we received an additional $10k and a guarantee of even more aid my sophomore year, which they upheld once I reminded them I had that writing on paper.)

My family will be going through an appeal process for my next semester as well. We will be discussing a loss of income for my father, as he works mainly on commission and his company does not allow in-person meetings at the moment. He will take a significant hit on income over the next few months as a result.

You NEED to be specific and open to communicating with them consistently. The financial aid office knows my name and my parents’ names. My suitemate who consistently talks to the financial aid office is also on a first name  basis with the office and her mom’s persistence ended up getting her tuition reduced. Do not be ashamed to ask for more money and mention matriculating elsewhere. They need to preserve their matriculation rate as well.

Another quick edit: get everything they say on paper & signed or through email! Always inquire about future years and see if you can get guarantees from them now. If you have proof for future years, they will give you additional aid. If you don’t, they might shaft you after your first year.",18,,1586178667.0,fmkekvg,False,False,1586152353.0,2020-04-06 00:52:33

I do know he also included an evaluation of the worth of the property prior to the recession when we bought it versus what it was two years ago, thus demonstrating a decline in worth.

I would also encourage your parents to just call/Zoom with the financial aid office. My dad also met with people when I went to Bulldog Saturday, which I think helped his case.

How does the GI bill affect financial aid?,Kovarian,"I have no experience with the GI bill, and my experience is 10-15 years out of date.

But.... when I attended (I assume you're an undergrad), the rule was that any outside scholarships or help just reduced Yale's payment. In fact, if the outside help went directly to Yale, it reduced Yale's amount *without* reducing your family contribution. So, for example, I had about $2000 in outside aid from various scholarships local businesses and organizations did in my hometown. All that did was reduce my financial aid package by $2000, and I had to pay the exact same amount I would have had to pay even if I didn't get those scholarships. In other words, it would have been better for everyone (other than Yale) for me to not have received the scholarships and for them to have gone to others. Now, maybe things have changed. And more likely, maybe the GI bill operates differently.

"I'm worried about DS writing, any advice?",Scriptorama,"> I went to a private school and learned to churn out analytical papers. 

Yale writing instructor here. You'll be fine. To be honest, even the students who went to private schools and learned to churn out papers, as you say, have major flaws in their writing. Students who come into their undergraduate careers with anything beyond fine to good writing skills are very rare even at Yale. The ones who think they are very good typically are not and still require a lot of work. 

Your commitment to wanting to better your writing is great, however! My biggest piece of advice is to share your writing. Share it with your friends, instructors who offer, and the writing center, which I can't recommend highly enough. Those of us who have been writing academically for years know that the key is to have a group of people whom you trust to give you feedback both stylistically and content wise. I'd recommend finding some people in your DS classes to workshop with, schedule regular meetings with professors and TAs (come with a paragraph to work through...we love having some concrete to work with), and taking your work to the writing center on the reg.

One of the great divides between interpretations of Quantum Mechanics is the question of “Collapse” or “No-Collapse” of the wave-function - Researchers at Yale seek to answer this question.,shoogainzgoblin,"> ELI5? (Or ELI a Yale humanities major)

Is there a difference between the two? ;) 

Quantum mechanics (QM) is a theory of probabilities. Schrodinger's cat comes to mind: is the cat dead, or is it alive? 

QM says that the information of a state is encoded in a wavefunction. This function dictates the probabilities of outcomes of certain measurements.

Back to the cat. QM would say that the cat is both dead and alive, as far as wavefunctions are concerned. Once you open the box to check on the cat, philosopher-scientists begin to disagree with each other. Suppose (without loss of generality) the cat is found dead. Now the wavefunction which once encoded 50% alive, 50% dead now encodes 100% dead. 

The article discusses how you can view this as either the initial wave function ""collapsing"" into the final wavefunction, or the measurements (taking the cat's pulse) have ""collapsed"" to be consistent with previous measurements **in the absence of any change in the wavefunction**.

This language can be made very precise and in a way less confusing using mathematics. I am having trouble understanding what the point of this article is. May someone less hungover have better luck.",3,,False,filhlb1,False,False,1582501761.0,2020-02-23 17:49:21

Try contacting the Yale financial aid office ([https://finaid.yale.edu/](https://finaid.yale.edu/)) to see what's going on. The staff there should be able to help you.

Also, be careful about getting outside scholarships and reporting them to Yale. Generally, Yale tends to deduct from your financial aid offer the amount you receive in outside scholarships. The basis for that policy is that the University should have given you enough money such that cost of attendance does not factor into your decision of whether to commit. If you do get some outside aid--like a couple hundred dollars--you could also choose not to report that amount to Yale. Of course, I'm not saying that you should. I'm just saying that you could.

Consider treating giant textbooks as backups to the lectures. They can reinforce what you missed or feel you don't quite get. For scholarly books, consider skimming but relying on academic reviews to give you an understanding of the text and a critique thereof. Consider making a ""review sheet"" summarizing each major assignment.  For books, I follow this format: author,  title, date of book, what it covers (one to two sentences), a short paragraph summarizing the book's argument (thesis and how the author proves it), a very short paragraph stating the problems you see in this argument (a critique).

Some have said don't take notes in class. You should be able to take enough to remember what was discussed (these are the things the professor thinks important), but hopefully you'll have slides or refs to the text so you won't have to write down all the details. 

Office hours or study section can help if you didn't nderstand something. Ideally you'll have prepped well enough to understand what the Prof is talking about, and maybe ask a question in class if needed. 

Make sure you know what you missed on any midterm exams. Those same things will come up on the final. 

For exam prep I generally found a not too comfy,  isolated place (we had some study cubes in our dorms basement no one used) and don't come up for air until you understand all the material. Turn your shit to airplane mode and check it only once in a while.

Edit- I also had good luck studying in coffee shops. Something about the other people there all doing their own shit peer pressured me into focusing. Don't leave your laptop unattey when you go for a duece; do ask a cute girl/guy if they'll keep an eye on it for you.

It’s way to easy here for your mood and happiness and motivation to spiral down over and over unless you are prioritizing ur own needs, and trust me that has been the most important thing by far in my time here. 

In terms of actual advice for classes, cuz it seems like that’s what u want, go to office hours—seriously. Even if you don’t necessarily understand the material better after, depending on the class you will either get very quick and directed help on how to do the assigned work, or at the very least (especially if it’s a non-quantitative class) you will let the professor know that u care and ur trying. I swear even if your work is just as good or bad as it was before, I think going somewhat consistently to office hours will make professors give you the benefit of the doubt way more often if you make mistakes. Just follow their advice and let their egos do the rest of the work when you feed them exactly what they want to hear lol. And maybe you’ll learn something along the way hopefully, but tbh that does not feel like the primary goal of institutions like this, Yale or otherwise.",2,,False,f79ft58,False,False,1573506946.0,2019-11-11 15:15:46

Should I Decide on Yale? (Transfer in a Dilemma),TreeOfFinches,"I’m not 100% certain if this is what you want, but Yale also has a major program called Ethnicity, Race, and Migration. ER&M was recently the subject of a major controversy on campus as professors pulled out of the major after Yale refused to provide legitimate faculty positions, but this has recently been resolved. It’s a wonderful major to concentrate in some of the areas you outlined, and it tends to have solid overlap with polisci such that you could just take ER&M classes in addition to polisci classes without actually majoring in it.

Additionally, Yale’s EP&E major (Ethics, Politics, and Economics) allows you to design a concentration, particularly in the areas you outlined above. This tends to be a more competitive major, though, and I’m unsure how transfer students are factored in.

Honestly, I feel as though Yale has faculty better equipped to teach and guide you on these topics, and the courses to do so as well. It seems as if the community here would be a better fit, as would the extracurriculars. Princeton is a very different environment than Yale, at least according to my friend who attends, and it would serve you well to factor community much more. If you decide that Princeton truly is a better fit academically, you have to realize that, ultimately, Yale and Princeton are definitely not far apart in terms of quality in your chosen areas of study. When it comes down to it, no one is going to look at your resumé and say, well, Princeton’s program is a smidge better, so we’ll hire this person. They will do this with extracurriculars, particularly if they are more related to what you’re interested in pursuing as a career.

Should I Decide on Yale? (Transfer in a Dilemma),TreeOfFinches,"I struggle to speak specifically on this topic, mainly because I am comparing my experience with my friend’s. I never applied to Princeton — my application to Yale was a crapshoot that worked in my favor.

While they may draw from a similar pool of applicants, that pool is very large and varied — and, ultimately, cross-admitted students pick the schools for different reasons. There certainly IS an apparent difference between Yale and Princeton, so don’t just think of it as lightly as the same pool of applicants.

For one, the political climate of each school tends to be different. Whether that’s actual make-up of the student body or just who seems to be more outspoken, I’m not sure. My friend and I are both LGBTQ, and while he doesn’t feel uncomfortable on Princeton’s campus, Yale seems to have more LGBT resources and, in general, more acceptance than Princeton. This also follows with the political views. Yale is EXTREMELY liberal; often, I find myself as more conservative than some of my friends, even as a moderate Democrat. Princeton, on the other hand, is a more conservative place.

Additionally, the sense of community seems to be more present at Yale. I think it is a well-known fact about Yale that its community is one of the best in the Ivy League, if not the best. While I don’t think it’s a tight-knit community overall, the residential college system, orientation & welcome systems (Frocos and froco groups), pre-orientation programs, involved cultural centers and peer liaisons, and the numerous extracurriculars allow students to find smaller communities within the school to help them fit in. Princeton has these small communities you could slot into, but the system for finding these communities is more difficult to navigate and isn’t as intuitive.

This isn’t to say there aren’t some advantages for Princeton over Yale, but I would generally say that those advantages tend to be more academic or based on facilities rather than social. I honestly think Yale has the best social atmosphere over any other Ivy League. 

If anyone would like to refute some of the things I’ve said, feel free! I don’t want to be the only voice for students looking for an overview of Yale vs. Princeton, especially since my experience in the Princeton sphere comes from one person I know well and a few other people I don’t know as well.

i think coming into yale i was in a high school-ish mentality where i wanted to take on as much work as possible, and (harmfully) thought a lot of the people warning me against that were either underestimating me or taking it too easy on themselves. this is wrong, though. taking a very very hard schedule is not only bad for your health but also stops you from more important things (i.e., no extracurriculars, some of which can really matter in terms of your profession/contacts and networking/social life/happiness/academic opportunities) and being very dedicated to four classes is more rewarding and can get you farther academically than struggling to keep up with six. i was in six hard-ass classes this semester and got As in all of them, yet absolutely was not dedicated enough to my extracurriculars and my health suffered—not to mention, i couldve gotten more out of the classes had i had more time for them.",9,,False,emosfjj,False,False,1557183618.0,2019-05-06 18:00:18

"I just got into Yale, and I'm really excited to (hopefully) attend! Could y'all say good things about your residential colleges?",Emperor_Deathsaur,"First off--congrats! I'm a Cali kid too, and my time at Yale so far has been awesome! Since you won't be living in your residential college next year unless you're in Silliman, TD, Franklin, or Murray, I think it can be hard for freshmen to get to know their residential college that well. But there's still lots of opportunities to get to know your residential college through dining/using facilities/etc!

Here's some pros/cons for some of the 14 residential colleges (I've left out some since I don't know all of them well):

Franklin/Murray--Good dining; good facilities; pretty far from everything other than Science Hill (where science facilities are) so kind of socially isolated

TD--Always gets shit on by everyone else, I'm not entirely sure how bad it actually is since I've never been there; location is pretty bad

Silliman--Good food; good location

Davenport (my college)--Dorms are apparently pretty big; location is neat Broadway (a plus) but kinda far from Science Hill or even Cross Campus (a minus); food is decent but not the best; Welch dorms (where freshmen in Davenport live) are pretty good imo

Berkeley--Really good food imo; great location in Cross Campus near the libraries, Durfees (student store), post office, Old Campus; the college is split into two (north half and south half) which I don't really like.

Stiles/Morse--Probably has the best food on campus; weird architecture

Saybrook--Bad food apparently

Trumbull--Its lunch hours are open later than other colleges so good if you're running late to lunch, but the dining hall gets super crowded and food sometimes runs out

But try not to let whatever residential college you get placed into in July affect how you perceive your Yale experience! I think all of the residential colleges have their good and bad parts, and you have a lot of freedom, so if you don't like your college's food, you can always eat elsewhere. And the people you will meet are awesome too; you'll have friends both in and out of your college.",9,,False,drd8yz7,False,False,1513493809.0,2017-12-17 00:56:49

We're not really sure what the Union has to offer given that traditional channels have been successful and less antagonizing with the administration. 3) Our Union is part of a larger statewide union group that doesn't have prior experience with graduate student concerns, and now ties us up with statewide politics. 4) The guy in charge is essentially a politician at this point (holds local office, etc) and often it seems he's pushing this for the sake of being able to say he started a Union.

Transition from California,fffriedrice,"Bay Area here! It was scary at first to think about moving so far and leaving all my high school friends behind. What reassured me was one of my closest high school teachers told me in her twenty years of teaching, she had only heard students regretting NOT going to school out-of-state. I’m inclined to agree — a lot of times, California itself feels like a bubble and undergrad is the least risky time to take the dive out of state. 
Yale also provides a lot of resources to help students make friends — there are preorientation programs like FOOT or Cultural Connections that give students a head start on building friendships before the official start of school, and the FroCo group system during the first week of school (Camp Yale) also helps you meet new people in your residential college. Unlike UC Berkeley, where most of the students are in-state and may have already-established high school cliques entering college, the students at Yale are from everywhere across the country, so really everyone is in the same boat as you are those first few weeks.

As to actually living in New Haven — I’ve grown to enjoy the seasonal changes a lot. The trees on campus are absolutely stunning in the fall, and while the winters are COLD, living somewhere where it snow is fun and different! While there isn’t a lot to do in New Haven, New York and Boston are a pretty manageable train ride away.

How's Engineering?,flamefoxx99,"CS here but familiar with engineering (I do research with an engineering prof)

You know how people are like “ah people in high school do extracurriculars just to get into college.” Yalies aren’t like that. They actually enjoy things beyond their major. One of my friends is a hardcore CS major, but works in the art gallery and spends as much time behind the easel as she does on a text editor. Another friend is a philosophy major but does research in the physics department. 

To that end, if you’re coming to college seeking an engineering full-stop education, it’ll be pretty good but you’ll be missing out on what Yale has to offer. If you want to be hella good at engineering while cultivating other interests and meeting similarly intellectually diverse people, no school does that better than  Yale. 

In terms of the actual education, It’s difficult but manageable (I.e. it’ll be intellectually challenging but won’t consume your life unless you want it too). Professors TEND to be generous with grading and inflation(few notable exceptions). Idk abt recruiting or employment, but the engineers I know tend to have research/internships lined up (some in finance but oh well), corona not withstanding.

I would say the big sell in engineering is the access, with three key catalysts.

1.	Yale is actively poaching faculty from other schools. CS alone has grown by 25% in 2 years, and I think other engineering is seeing similar growth. ChemE and BioE and whatever else up science hill have a whole new building funded by YALE money not donor money. Tells you how much they’re prioritizing insofar as they didnt wait around for a big donor and funded it on their own schedule.
2.	 Access to faculty is incredible. I emailed two professors, both got back to me in 2 days, talked with them, and within the week had projects I could work on with them. After filling out one form and sending one email, I got user access to the Grace computing cluster equal to that of grad students and post docs. 
3.	Theres YES weekend and the Hahn fellowship, where they are literally throwing money and mentorship at students",16,,False,flwc6p8,False,False,1585545742.0,2020-03-30 00:22:22

I found the academic environment overall encouraging, collaborative, not overly competitive.  The CEID (center for engineering, innovation, and design) keeps growing year to year.  It offers clubs and excellent classes where you can get your hands on and build.  Recruiting is ehh but you can find jobs on your own, if you try.

My favorite things to do when I go back are to go see a show at the Yale Rep or the Yale Cabaret (which is really cool and much cheaper). My fav restaurants are Miya’s (which has a good late night special), the Pantry, and Barcelona. And the Ethiopian food cart by the led school. There are usually a lot of food carts there. Oh, and Modern Apizza, of course. New Haven has really good restaurants for a city its size. And since it’s a small city, they’re all relatively close together and easy to get to. I most just stuck to the cheap ones.

The Shubert, Long Wharf Theater, and College Street Music Hall are places you can see live theater or music that aren’t part of Yale. 

I never really went there but New Haven has a couple of parks on the Long Island sound. I ave art on my wall of a really pretty view from Nathan Hale Point (I think that might be the name).

Yale vs Oxford?,jaxsson98,"Hey! So I was in nearly the same situation as you. I’m from the US, but I was choosing between Yale and Oxford for History/History and Econ. Because I’m on this subreddit you can clearly tell what my choice was. The biggest determinant in my choice was the flexibility at Yale. I personally didn’t feel ready to dedicate my entire undergraduate time to studying just those subjects. Another factor was extracurriculars. I’ve heard from some other people that extracurriculars are less common at Oxford due to a heavy focus solely on coursework (I can’t confirm this however so you may want to ask the Oxford subreddit), whereas at Yale, nearly every person I know is doing at least one, and probably more. But ultimately there both great choices and you can’t really make a wrong decision. I’m also studying abroad at Oxford next year, so you could potentially reach some sort of compromise by doing a study abroad or grad school at the other institution.

Oxford, from what I've seen, is a different culture in that coursework really will define your experience. I think is less of an emphasis on social life and extracurriculars. That said, someone at Oxford will be more informed.

Stress is inevitable, sorry to tell you. You have hard classes, lots of extracurriculars, and pressure to spend your summers on career advancement. However, grade inflation is pretty big here (especially in STEM majors) and that generally helps me be less stressed about my grades/GPA. Also, as my froco told me: “Your Yale degree carries a lot more weight than your grades.” He’s right.

Overall, however, I think Yale is pretty happy. You can really carve out roles for yourself within the communities on campus, and the res college system really emphasizes that. I love it here and I’ve not regretted my decision to attend.

And while the feelings expressed by the people in the video may not represent all students the Yale administration did not support Erika Christakis nor do I recall it condemning any of the more egregious behavior in the video.

Proof of select students behaving poorly is not proof that everyone behaved in a similar fashion. Let's not kid ourselves, no one is recording a ""reasoned conversation"" and posting it online. Even if such a recording existed, you can bet Fox would be ignoring it.

In fact, Christakis was scheduled to host an open forum on the email issue where students could reasonably air their grievances. This forum was cancelled on more than one occasion despite mounting pressure. This prompted students to essentially track down Christakis and shout him down. In no way do I think that was the right course of action by students, but this piece of context is CONSTANTLY ignored. Had Christakis simply hosted the forum OR students waited for such a forum, this situation would've been resolved in a much more responsible fashion.

I do agree with you though that the administration's response was punchline worthy.

>this prompted students to essentially track down Christakis and shout him down.

Nothing prompted adult men and women to shout down Nicholas Christakis down but a lack of respect for others. In the video Nicholas Christakis acted reasonably and respectfully toward the students and there is no excuse for the behavior displayed by the students. None. Full stop.

>Had Christakis simply hosted the forum OR students waited for such a forum, this situation would've been resolved in a much more responsible fashion.

Again you put the blame on the Christakis for not having a forum and some of the adult men and women Yale students for behaving poorly. Also do you have anything to substantiate that it was the Christakis and not the outrageous behavior of students, failings of the administration, or a combination of the two that caused any forum to not occur?

I am aware of a petition of 40-50 professors supporting the Christakis and a petition of over 450 students, alumni, and professors condemning Erika Christakis. That you acknowledge people who would support the Christakis feared demonization, and perhaps retribution, should demand you ask from whom. Who would be demonizing these people? If the answer is enough of the Student body to endanger professionals reputation and careers then you have your answer as to whom is the bad actor in this.

>Yale caved due to all the negative press brought on by an extremely vocal group of protesters.

And from your own account the majority of the student body stood by and let it happen. That vocal minority is still there today so if you find yourself shouted down or demonized for espousing a point of view you know whom to thank.

MILO Is Coming To Yale,FishFilet1337,"As brief as I can make it:
> why did the forum not happen?

1. The forums didn't happen because the Christakis' themselves were cancelling them. This happened prior to any inappropriate behavior by the students.

> Nothing prompted adult men and women to shout down Nicholas Christakis down but a lack of respect for others. 

2. Again, I have said numerous times I thought it was ridiculous how the students acted. You keep replying as if I'm somehow defending that behavior. I'm simply explaining what led to the actions, no justifying them. The administration purposely removed a formal place to complain after saying they'd offer one. No matter your perspective, that was a mistake on their part.

> Again you put the blame on the Christakis for not having a forum

3. Maybe try reading a bit closer, I said ""Had Christakis simply hosted the forum OR students waited for such a forum"" in attempt to show how altered actions could've changed the face of the incident. I'm not apportioning blame. I'm saying that if student's would've waited for the appropriate time/manner to complain OR the Christakis' fulfilled their initial offer to hear the complaints in a forum there would be no videos.

> Who would be demonizing these people? 

4. A vocal minority.

> And from your own account the majority of the student body stood by and let it happen.

5. Believe it or not, most students have much more important things to do than argue or protest over social justice issues. Many students heard of the incident second hand, then moved on with their lives. 

> This was a well earned black eye for Yale and media is not responsible for it.

6. Agree to disagree. The way the media portrayed it was that Yale as a whole agreed with it. That isn't true.

Yale Triggers Protests After Expelling Depressed Student,F1stuff,"This is a throwaway accout for obvious reasons. I've followed the Mao case since it hit the news.

I was once an international student on a visa. I'm genuinely curious how other international students feel about Mao's case, because I can't for the life of me find anything more than passing sympathy for him, and certainly do not support his reinstatement. FWIW, I'm in the GSAS so don't assume I don't know anything of the matter.

1. F1 (the standard international student visa, which I assume Mao has--if he doesn't, he has some equivalent of it) visas have very clear rules about maintaining your status. There are things like minimum number of enrolled hours, max. number of work hours, possibly GPA requirements (I can't remember this one because it's been a long time since I was on my F1). TLDR, you must maintain your F1 status and the requirements are very clear. They are set at the federal level; Yale has nothing to do with these.

2. The stressful factors Mao states are literally life-stuff that we all deal with at some point or other. I wasn't able to visit family when a very close relative passed away because I had to keep up certain requirements at the time. I'm sure other F1-holders can relate similar stories. So the sob-story is by no means unremarkable. If you are lucky enough to be granted an F1 (or similar) visa, it's up to you to make sure that you know what you're getting into. This does mean having to simply chin up and move along through tough shit.

3. Yale mental health. Yes, I realize there are serious issues that have come under criticism in the past. But I also want to point out that Yale is one of the richest institutions in the country. The healthcare package offered to PhD students is pretty amazing by any standards. I'm sure the healthcare options available to undergrads and professional students are at least comparable. At the same time, Yale is a university, and its healthcare can only go so far. If someone feels they are so far gone that what the university healthcare offers does not suffice, then they must at least recognize that and seek resolution via a leave of absence or something. But Mao has consistently refused to clarify these things, and has even refused to allow Yale to have its say (to be clear, Yale admin has also refused to comment on this). So all we're going on is Mao's words.

4. [Mao previously earned an MA at Pepperdine](http://www.courant.com/education/hc-new-haven-mental-health-20151211-story.html), a US institution often derided (justly or otherwise) as sort of a resort university for frivolous types. His MBA at Yale is his second Master's-level experience. So I'm not sure what's with his claims of ""culture shock"" upon arriving at Yale. The Hartford Courant (linked earlier) may be mistaken in their reporting. If they are correct, then Mao's claim of ""culture shock"" is bizarre given that he already had prior experience with an American university. 

5. Speaking from personal experience at Yale and elsewhere, I can say that universities rarely will take such a drastic step as kicking someone out for missing half a credit load. Yale, especially, bends over backwards to accommodate student needs (this can and has worked positively and negatively, but that's another topic). My point is that it's hard for me to accept, without further clarification, the simple claim that Yale kicked Mao out for missing his requirements by half a credit. That Mao refuses to provide further details doesn't help.

6. Even if you lose your visa status, it's absurd to say that you're going to be deported in 15 days. You are allowed to appeal to the USCIS for reinstatement. You can apply for a different visa category within 60 days. TLDR: you are not, legally, required to leave the country until 60 days after the point of loss of visa status. I don't know who messed up here: an ignorant Yale admin (possible) or Mao making strange claims. What really bugs me is that GESO took his words and is running with it without even this level of basic scrutiny.

I agree that Yale mental healthcare needs to be improved, based on the numerous critical accounts, but I absolutely do not think Grant Mao's case is as open and shut as current reporting suggests. ",6,,False,cy9fite,False,False,1450910009.0,2015-12-23 16:33:29

Japanese was the most difficult language I've ever studied. The grammar and syntax are completely different. You have to start learning with a form of the language written in the Roman alphabet before moving to the syllable alphabets and characters used in Japanese. There are no familiar words for an English speaker, unlike in French or German.

I would say that French is easiest, then German, than Chinese. When I took French at Yale, many years ago, its French department was excellent. The teaching was good but also there were grammar drill exercises that students could check out and use, which was a more efficient use of time than constantly drilling students in the classroom. The classes were small and they met several times a week, which is essential for the early stages of learning a language.

Recently, I filled out a health insurance questionnaire that was similar, but the question allowed me to select ""all that apply"" or ""up to X that apply."" You could also ask on which of the choices does the individual most rely.

Grammatically, the sentence should read:  How do you stay informed ***about*** COVID-19? 

 **How frequently do you wash your hands?** 

You might also want to ask how long the individual washes her or his hands.

 **When you leave your home, do you wear a mask?** 

Not all the choices make sense to me. Why would you leave your mask off upon leaving he house only to return with it on? You should also include a question like ""I generally keep the mask on, but make sure to have it in place when I am closer than six feet from another person.""

 **How frequently do you leave your home for necessities? (Groceries, supplies, work, etc.)** 

Suggested edit: How frequently do you leave your home to go to work or to buy necessities such as groceries, general supplies, work supplies?

 **Do you practice Social Distancing?** 

The second choice should be something like ""Sometimes,"" or ""Generally, but not all the time."" The answer has to make sense without referring to the first choice. Grammatically, it would ""frequently,"" not ""frequent.""

Physics + math at Yale?,fuzentrix,"You don't need to ditch the double major if you want to take graduate level courses in physics (or any other subject). Yale doesn't really enforce prerequisite courses, so you can just enroll in graduate level courses when you feel prepared to take them, although I would strongly advise making sure you're prepared before you do. Therefore you can just enroll in the grad-level courses for relativity and whatever else and no one will really blink an eye (talk to the prof if you're worried). I have taken multiple grad-level courses and there was no issue. I would also argue that doubling in math and physics is the ideal combination if you want to pursue theory in grad school. There's also a joint major which requires less courses from each major if you want to pursue that in [Mathematics and Physics] (http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/mathematics-physics/), or you can just major in one and take as many courses as you want in another.

The ""math for physics"" course I'm assuming you mean PHYS 301, which is the minimum math required for physics majors. I would recommend just taking the math courses equivalents in the mathematics department, since PHYS 301 is the minimum you would need to graduate the physics major and can easily be replaced/substituted by taking ample advanced math courses. PHYS 301 is generally also not a great course. At a minimum I would take MATH 222/225 (lin alg) and ENAS 194 or MATH 246/247 (diff eq), although if you're doing theoretical physics definitely go for the higher-level proof based electives like real analysis, complex analysis, topology, etc.

Did any of you guys attend YYGS?,adamup27,"For the record: I did not attend YYGS as a student but helped out on the staff side through YC&E. The students that go through (and pass) definitely get a bump with applications; essays are irrelevant for this bump. If your essay reflects something relevant from YYGS (such as team building; community; leadership) than speak to it. 

However, the students that go through YYGS leave with four thoughts. About 25% go through and marry Yale. They love the campus and will do nothing to jeopardize it. 50% leave with an impression and knowledge of campus but are not committed - other schools may recruit them but there’s no strong feelings good or bad. About 20% leave with a negative feeling; YYGS is intense and the pressure is always on. Staff might not always be the best and everyone else on site might not be able to help. Remember, it’s still Yale Standard ^TM
The remaining 5% are those who get kicked or failed due to policy violations.

GPA?,BluBombers,"In the simplest terms, I can only tell you that the best GPA to have is the one that will make you the happiest--the one that will be the most conducive to a good life. Only *you* can truly determine what is a good GPA to have at Yale or what is a good GPA to target. Is law school in your future? Perhaps, then, your ideal GPA is higher than one for someone trying to pursue an MBA. Just make sure to know why you want a certain GPA. And especially make sure that you have a good reason for pursuing it. This might come off as a bit abrasive, but if you're trying to get a high GPA simply to stroke your ego, you're either incredibly vile or profoundly stupid. Perhaps even both. If you're trying to get a high GPA to simply go to some prestigious graduate program--not even because you have some reasonable, underlying purpose behind trying to go to that school--then I can almost guarantee that you won't find happiness come ten or twenty years from now. A GPA is but the means, not the ends. And it should be the ends to something virtuous. 

There's a stigma here about having low GPAs or having GPAs lower than your friends. There's even a stigma about not finding ""success"" after Yale. We tend to think of college as a race. I don't think that analogy completely describes what the Yale experience should be. If this is a race, then while we may all be running, every one of us runs on unique lanes that we've selected for ourselves. Some have longer paths than others. Some shorter. The only thing that matters is that you finish your own journey. Don't worry about what other people do.

"Serious question: if a student has a history of harassing other students, should they face academic discipline or expulsion?",airbornemint,"So, two big things here.

Thing the first: That's not how I interpreted /u/I_Am_The_Maw's comment. I interpreted it to mean that 

1. Without information beyond ""someone made an unjustified call to the police about someone else"" it's impossible to tell whether that's a) racism b) paranoia c) paranoid racism or d) other and
2. Without knowing whether we're dealing with racism, paranoia, both, or neither, it's impossible to say what the appropriate response is. 

I agree that appropriate response to racism is needed. I agree that the recent incident at Yale was likely based in a racial bias. But the question that started this thread was not about the recent incident, as far as I can tell, it was about the more general question of what the appropriate response would be to student-on-student harassment in the form of unjustified police calls. (Yes, I do realize the question was inspired by the recent event at Yale.)

But I also think that if you have mental health needs that manifest as racism, then we're not gonna very far by trying to punish your racist behavior without trying to treat your underlying mental health issue.

(This actually comes up a lot in healthcare with patients who have some kind of cognitive deficit that leads to diminished impulse control, which then makes them less able (or unable) to filter their thoughts and their behavior, sometimes resulting in racist behavior, and how to deal with it is a very complicated question.)

Thing the second — and this goes both to /u/lvlierop and /u/I_Am_The_Maw: discussing the abstract topic of ""student of unspecified race harasses a different student of unspecified race"" is actively harmful when it's done in the context of ""every fucking day a white person calls the police on a black person for no good reason"".

The reason that it is harmful is that you are bringing up (and discussing) a completely hypothetical scenario that didn't happen and (more importantly) doesn't happen, and by doing so you are taking up time and space that would be better spent on having a conversation about what actually did (and does) happen, which is white people calling the cops for someone doing something totally normal while black.

What I am getting at is:

 * What we are seeing today is: a pattern of white people calling cops on black people and recently that pattern *happened to manifest* as student-on-student harassment at Yale. 
 * What we *aren't* seeing today is: a pattern of student-on-student harassment by means of unjustified calls to the police which *happened to manifest* as white-on-black harassment at Yale

And therefore the conversation that is appropriate to have is about the former (general patterns of racist calls to the cops, which actually are a thing, and the specific incident at Yale), and the conversation that is useless and distracting would be about the latter (general patterns of people unreasonably calling the cops on each other, which aren't actually a thing, and the specific incident at Yale).

In other, shorter and more pointed, words: don't try to take race out of the conversation about an incident that was racially motivated and a part of a clear pattern of other racially motivated incidents. Trying to take race out of racist bullshit is *in itself* a particular form of being racist (just a much more subtle form than calling the cops on someone).

Two things. 1) You are reducing the situation down to ""doing things we don't like"", when it was actually harmful and destructive behavior with racist undertones. 2) In your response you talked about mental illness. Combining that with this sentence is troubling. Tell me you don't think that racism is the same or on the same level as mental illness, or that mental illness necessarily leads to racism. 

I'm not interested in the repercussions, because the university probably will not take any steps and this student will face social ridicule. So ultimately the university will just ignore situations when the police are called on students of color for doing basically nothing, and no sort of productive reprimands or discipline will happen, only isolation and avoidance. 

>Learning to deal with people you disagree with and understanding why they think how they do is part of the reason we all came to a place like this.

Like what are we supposed to do with this? I've studied racism extensively, I have a good idea of why she called the police (not saying I know everything, or that I think she is ""violently racist""). Now what.  Ultimately, the people who would benefit from this kind of patronizing talk are those who engage in racist thoughts and actions. 

I don't think that trying to get sympathy for this woman by saying ""but what if she had a mental illness??"" is productive or relevant. Idk if you have been on medication or been through therapy, but those things do not exist to cure racism or sexism.

Diversity is great and everything, but I do believe developing and fostering greater intellect supersedes inclusiveness.

I don't get why I have to blame everything on white people.  **I am a minority** and all the BLM students I speak to just try to push a victim-mentality and push the white-privilege/white-supremacy narrative.  I have experienced some racism/discrimination as a minority, but regardless I just have to keep putting one foot in front of another, and just move forward.  Blaming white people is gross/lazy, also pointless.

No, I am not Black, but as a minority a few guiding principles have been passed down:

* personal responsibility
* accountability
* solid work ethic
* discipline
* compassion

I see none of these traits in BLM.  From my experiences, it's been nothing but aggression, crime, looting, excused-racism against whites; all under the facade of ""equality, diversity, inclusiveness.""  What's worse is these BLM kids never ever want to discuss Black crime on Whites, Black crime on Blacks, or hell Black crime on other damn minorities.

Physics/astronomy Major,RegulusKhan,"Hello! 

&#x200B;

I graduated with an astrophysics major a few years ago so this could be my time to shine! The big question is going to be how deep is your physics and math background? I would definitely suggest taking only 4 or 4.5 credits your first semester so the most likely ""correct answer"" is to take at least one physics course (either 180/200/260) and take at least one math course (112/115/120/etc). The physics courses listed above are basically the same thing in that they all deal with Mechanics but they are at very different levels; if you test into Physics 180, which is the lowest level, don't feel bad! A lot of my astronomy classmates were in Physics 180 with me. Also you should probably take either Astro 210 or Astro 220 during your first year. These two courses are the intro astronomy courses and you only take one of them so whichever seems to suit your fancy; I took Astro 210 with Dr. Zinn and loved that course. Then I would suggest looking at possibly taking one of the corresponding physics lab sections with the physics course. The major requires that you take two physics labs, but you can substitute one out for the astronomy observing lab.   


So generally a semester in your first year should look like: Physics course, Math course, Astro course, physics lab (?), fourth class. Now, this is the ""correct"" path but it is not the only path. I took freshman physics as a sophomore. I took freshman physics lab as a senior. I took some required math courses in my junior year (speaking of math, keep an eye out for ENAS courses. These are Math for Engineering courses and, from my experience, can be better than courses from the math department). There's a lot of flexibility in the major. One thing they don't emphasize though is that I would suggest taking some form of coding courses. There is a course on intro basic coding for astronomy course and an Astrostats course, but I would definitely suggest building a strong coding background as that will be incredibly helpful in astronomy research and so many other fields should you ever decide that astrophysics isn't something that you want to do.  


You'll hear a lot about taking really easy classes as your fourth class in order to get the distributional requirement, and while I don't knock this, I would highly suggest taking something interesting over something easy. Some of my favorite classes were outside of the astrophysics major (shout out to Roman Republic and Roman Empire by Prof. Johnston) and at times I found courses that almost made me change majors. College is four years; explore while you can.

&#x200B;

In the future, the physics part of the astrophysics program breaks off into the regular physics track (401/402/439) and the intensive physics track (410/420/430/440/441). You have some time to think about it but if you're looking at grad school, I would go intensive. This however is not a deal breaker as I took the non-intensive route and ended up in grad school.

&#x200B;

Finally, you should definitely join Yale Undergraduate Aerospace Association as someone mentioned. I was a member for a few years and it was awesome. You get access to the CEID, which is the Center for Engineering and Design, which is an incredible space. YUAA sends a group every year to rocket competitions, on top of other teams which can include building a satellite, and also does a great job of bringing in really interesting speakers.

  
I hope this helped! Feel free to reply or DM me if you have any more questions.

Why Yale?,finolex1,"Unfortunately, none us undergrads have actually attended Harvard or Stanford. While we love to rehash old stereotypes of cut-throat Harvard students, we can't really claim that one is more or less competitive than the other.

I've personally found Yale, and my residential college in particular, to be very tight knit. Unlike colleges in NYC/Boston where people spread out all over on weekends, there's not a whole lot else to do in New Haven, which means campus life takes center stage. This includes a ton of underground performances, suite parties, nearby restaurants, frats or student group events. 

With regards to students, all my peers are certainly driven, but I've never felt that people were ever competing against each other - we are all just striving towards our own goals.

Lastly, I think Yale's campus is simply a lot more beautiful to look at. Harvard and Stanford are nice, but they don't have as many stunningly beautiful places to match say, Sterling library, Branford courtyard, Hillhouse avenue or the Art Gallery.",16,,False,flq4v5m,False,False,1585379199.0,2020-03-28 02:06:39

What was the best class you ever took at Yale?,petzl20,"[Was a little while ago, but] I took French (purely from a recommendation by a friend, because she talked about it so avidly).  I did it with some  trepidation, because in high school my experience with foreign language courses was terrible: the classes were rote repetition, constantly changing from English to Spanish and back again (a huge mistake). I thought it was my fault, that learning a language are just ""hard."" Yale's Capretz Method uses immersion and can yield fantastic results for those so motivated. A friendly camaraderie  results from the small class size and the near-constant participation.  I was hugely lucky to have a very social, very talented native French graduate student teaching my section; this person is critical to one's experience and overall success. (Thank you, Yvette Smith-- I will be forever indebted to you for your skill and brio with which you infused every lesson.)  After 3-4 weeks, I estimate I made more progress than 4 years of high school language classes. In the end, it wasn't just fun knowing French, it was fun learning French (the whole journey/destination thing).

The best advice is what you're doing right now.  Find out what classes really excite people, and take some of those classes, whatever the subject, however unfamiliar you are with it, without regard to your major (or what you think is your major).

Questions from an incoming freshman,vanessamc,"1) Party life at college is whatever you want it to be! There are friend groups that sit in and marathon Seinfeld on Friday nights, there are friend groups that get sloshed on Wednesday nights--there is a place for everyone. You won't have a friend group on day one so parties at the beginning will be awkward, but you'll find your way :)

2) You can handle anything, but not everything. Take 1-2 challenging courses and take the other 2 easier. If you're between two levels of courses--take the easier one your freshman fall. There will be plenty of time to challenge yourself later ;)

3) Some suites become best friends forever, some never speak. Either way it works out. If you like your suite--boom insta friends. If you don't, you'll be more encouraged to be adventurous and meet new people.

4) The cold makes you strong! I think there's no such thing as bad weather, only bad gear. Invest in good waterproof shoes and rain jacket and you'll be fine.

Undergraduate Physics at Yale?,rueynshard,"I'm an undergrad at Yale, so here's my 2 cents worth:

The facilities and professors are top notch. The Wright Lab (http://wlab.yale.edu/) has recently been completely refurbished, the Sterling Laboratory has reopened, Yale's West Campus is growing (http://westcampus.yale.edu/), and I think a few more buildings are in the pipeline. We also have a cool little planetarium, and access to observatories across the globe. The professors come from the same pool as all other top Physics programs, so I assume the teaching quality is similar, but class sizes tend to be smaller and more intimate.

With regards to grad school admissions, I think a similar student who goes to Harvard and Yale will fare equally well. The relatively smaller cohort of students means it should be easy to get good letters of recommendation (which are one of the most important criteria for grad school admissions). A quick search https://www.physics.harvard.edu/academics/phds shows that Yalies are pretty well represented at top grad school programs. 


I think the area where Yale really shines is the whole undergrad experience - as one of the most competitive colleges to get into, your peers will on average be really smart, quirky, artistic, funny and/or ambitious and you will learn from them as much as you do from your classes. Unlike technical institutes like MIT/Caltech, you'll be friends with people for whom music/drama/philosophy, etc. are not just side interests but major passions. The only possible downside that I can perceive is that physical sciences/engineering won't dominate mainstream conversation and culture the way they might do at MIT/Caltech/Stanford (though this is a good thing in my opinion).

Oh and Yale is pretty generous with Financial aid for international students, if that matters to you.",5,,False,d9dhe5i,False,False,1477793196.0,2016-10-29 21:06:36
Undergraduate Physics at Yale?,darthoctopus,"I was a study-abroad student at Yale (physics major, 2014-2015), so I've studied physics both at Yale and at not-Yale at undergraduate level. Broadly speaking:

### What's it like?

I second /u/FishFilet1337 in that the undergraduate physics curriculum doesn't vary much between colleges (at least it was pretty much the same at Yale vs at my old undergrad home university). The main differences for me were of organisational culture and resource availability. My home university was fairly large (~70 physics majors annually), and you can perhaps imagine the difference in competitiveness for undergrad research opportunities (and funding for it) that emerges, compared to Yale (which, when I was there, had about ~15 students taking PHYS 382L).

That's not necessarily representative of the physics class size at Yale, though, because (unlike the fairly rigid curriculum at my home university) there are actually several undergrad physics major tracks available (from BA to BSc (intensive) in increasing order of time investment). PHYS 382L (advanced physics laboratory) would have been compulsory for the intensive majors, and available as an elective for everyone else.

Because of above factors, your mileage ~~may~~ *will* vary. You might not spend a lot of time in physics/math at all (that's not to say that the other classes aren't cool, because they are). Even if you do end up taking a more intense physics major, there's a lot of freedom in choice of electives once you fulfil the strict major requirements. 

### How cool is it?

It's pretty cool. You get to play with a particle accelerator the size of a room for physics lab (just you, your lab partner, and Larry the beam operator, although I hear he retired last year…); you get to go for office hours with impressively-credentialed professors (and then ask them for recommendation letters for summer REUs and grad school once you're all chummy); if you fulfil the prerequisites (and, if you don't, as long as you can convince the professor), you can take any class you want (this applies everywhere, not just in physics or math). 

Like I said, though, the more important differences for me were the culture and resources. I'm grateful to my undergraduate home university for providing me with a firm scientific foundation (which helped me survive study abroad at Yale, and now grad school), but it was an ultimately impersonal affair. Yale, on the other hand, is small enough to be very determined that you *in particular* should succeed, and will spare you as much as she can afford should you prove sufficiently promising. I found that level of personal attention both reassuring and very humbling.",3,,1477526686.0,d999xaw,False,False,1477526250.0,2016-10-26 18:57:30
Undergraduate Physics at Yale?,FishFilet1337,"Grad student here. I'll throw my opinion in for what it's worth. Undergraduate colleges by and large have the same curriculum in the sciences. Quality of teachers vary between schools, but it's more beneficial to have a good teacher in a classroom versus a well known-researcher.

Resources like available research opportunities, facilities, etc are important, especially if you plan on being involved in out of the classroom activities. These resources are (IMO) very hard to quantify BUT are one of the most important factors when picking a college for engineers, scientists, mathematicians, etc. Outstanding out of the classroom research experience will boost a grad school application more than a big name school.

That being said, most of the science undergrads I've come across seem happy with Yale.

saybrook suites,sam-rk,"So I worked in the SY head of college office until recently and can confirm that you cannot access floor plans easily due to safety concerns.

SY is split into entryways that range from 3 floors tall to 6. You'll share a bathroom (usually 2 sinks, 2 toilets, 1-2 showers for 6-10 people in normal years) with the other people on your floor. You normally have access to the other entryways through the basement or by walking outside. Your floor or suite may be coed, but they can switch things around if this is an issue.

The rooms are old. They don't have AC, but they have heaters. Bring a fan for move in day. It gets really hot.

You'll likely be in a suite because there are very few standalone singles. Saybrook has suites of 6 people or smaller and one large suite of 12 (reserved for sophomores normally). The suites are usually a combination of single and double rooms with a shared common room. I hear that they may furnish the common rooms but that wasn't the case in the past. Each occupant gets a bed (twin xl), a desk, a chair and a dresser. Sometimes you'll get an armoire instead of the dresser, depends on the room. 
The walls are the texture of popcorn ceilings so it's pretty hard to hang things. I've found that double sided foam tape works best. Or nails. But don't do that bc you'll be fined for screwing up the walls.

If you see a door that is marked ""fire exit"" DO NOT OPEN IT. They are alarmed and will go off until you call Yale Security, go to the head of college office (Entryway I, 1st floor) or the fire department comes.

The ""vibe"" of Saybrook is awesome. Super tight knit community, great admin, lots of fun events (usually... boo covid) and a very active student government. I usually introduce people to SY by talking about the Saybrook strip and explaining how SY is the college everyone talks shit about but we have some of the best college spirit.

Summer Storage Help,EgoSumAbbas,"If you're forced to fly back in November, there's no way they wouldn't let you leave your stuff in your dorm room. Remember that your room is the same through the full academic year, so there's no reason you shouldn't be able to leave your stuff and go back to it in January. I think it'd be incredibly unlikely for Yale to hold in-person class in the Fall but not the Spring (if anything it'd be the other way around). 

As for CoVid, all my belongings are literally still in my dorm room as I left them in March. My friend is coming to pick up my valuables in the next few days, but Yale is letting us leave large items and boxes full of clothes there over the summer, and they'll take them to our dorm room for next semester eventually. 

I know people have been really harsh on Yale regarding CoVid, but honestly, they've done an amazing job, especially in comparison to the way other colleges have reacted. I personally wouldn't worry too much about moving in properly to your dorm room, but of course it's up to you.

Normally, in a non-pandemic year, in terms of storage over the summer, most residential colleges will let you keep couches, lamps, bookshelfs, and other large items in the dorm room you'll occupy next year. Most students put the rest of their belongings in external storage facilities (there are companies that take your boxes and move out for you, or if you're cheap you can rent a U-Haul and drive it out to Branford yourself). This shouldn't be your main concern right now, though.",19,,False,fvi6geo,False,False,1592709700.0,2020-06-20 22:21:40
Summer Storage Help,sam-rk,"As a new alum (class of 2020) I'd suggest you bring the bare minimum. Yale has struggled with supporting it's students through the first wave of COVID so I wouldn't be surprised if they have logistical trouble if campus shuts down.

I know that if you sign a full year housing contract they are gonna be obligated to help if something goes wrong, but ""help"" could mean anything. If you move your stuff in and they kick you out they should give you a chance to get it all back. Based on the struggle of packing everyone's stuff after this semester, Im fairly sure that they'll try to have students pack their own belongings rather than going through every suite and shipping things to you.

Id recommend finding a friend or two and split the rental fee on a storage unit if you're really worried about larger items if Yale kicks you out

Last year I paid Yale $30 to store three 12""x24""x24"" boxes. That was the max they could store. No irregularly shaped (bigger than the box) items or valuables. 

Most students end up using an alternate moving service that charges a lil less per box and has space for couches and that crap. It ends up being more expensive and less accessible than your own storage locker though.",4,,False,fvi2xwr,False,False,1592707457.0,2020-06-20 21:44:17

Very minor quibble, but it's not ""each"".

Entrepreneurship,greenwave314,"I wouldn't listen to this guy\^. There's an abundance of great entrepreneurship resources here, evidenced by the multiple startups that make it into prestigious incubators like Y Combinator every year. I would recommend familiarizing yourself with Tsai CITY's website, as they are Yale's current entrepreneurial hub. There are many student organizations, including YES (Yale entrepreneurial society), Yale Launch (essentially an incubator), and a ton of intensives at Tsai CITY. Apply to the Tsai Summer Fellowship if you have an idea you want to develop and need mentoring/funding. Apply to the CEID Summer Fellowship if you want to build out a hardware product. Apply to the multitude of grants and prizes, all of which you can find by exploring Tsai CITY's website.

Regarding your second question, there's no specific combination of majors that define an entrepreneur. However, economics can certainly be useful when analyzing the market landscape. EE and CS are also extremely useful if you're making a hardware or app based product (CS in particular, since it seems that Silicon Valley unicorns are increasingly app-based). With that being said, your attitude and mindset as an entrepreneur will always matter more than what you major in. Have tenacity and don't be afraid to fail. Pursue a project only if you're truly passionate about it and have a vision for the future, otherwise it'll be tedious.

Regarding your third question:

From Tsai CITY's FAQ:

*""WHAT HAPPENED TO THE YALE ENTREPRENEURIAL INSTITUTE? IS TSAI CITY JUST A REBRANDED VERSION OF YEI?*

*They are actually two separate entities. The Yale Entrepreneurial Institute did amazing work elevating entrepreneurship at Yale over the past decade. YEI's leadership remains with Yale's Office of Cooperative Research, focusing on advancing faculty-originated innovation and entrepreneurship. Powered by Joseph Tsai's gift in 2017, Yale launched the Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale with a broader mission than YEI: to support student innovation and entrepreneurship in the form of not only for-profit startups, but also nonprofits, civic and community organizations, arts and cultural organizations, cooperatives, social justice movements, student clubs, faith-based organizations, and any other field of endeavor that interests and motivates them. Tsai CITY is itself a startup — we're building a new institution with a new, broader mission. Join us! Come help us design, experiment, test, operate, and evolve something excellent.""*

I believe the Tsai CITY Summer Fellowship is currently the main summer accelerator.

Art/Computing and the Arts at Yale,nekoallergy,"I'd go to Stanford, if only to avoid (very) lackluster SEAS here. Stanford's not known for art but good enough. Especially if you're set on Yale Art for grad, Stanford's a good change of environment from the East. 

Otherwise, Stanford grad admission's pretty screwy (CS's a total crapshoot), so I'd take the prof's word w/a grain of salt -- I haven't heard anything about Yale Art, but my impression's Yale Law slightly prefers us undergrads. Especially if you can strike a good relationship w/an art prof here, I can see you having an easier time getting in for grad. 

But Yale Art's pretty purist, they certainly make the major harder than it needs to be imo. I'd only endorse Yale if STEM's a secondary priority for you (just like it is for Yale's admin) and if you can push through the beginner art classes here, which skew towards non-majors.

Prospective International Student Asking About Yale,VaguelyRelevant,"For context, I'm a junior majoring in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. My experiences are not those of everyone at Yale, so take this with a pinch of salt.

1. The atmosphere you're describing, on the whole, is spot-on. Everywhere you go there's going to be some people who try to force competition or dislike working with groups, but at Yale the general culture is one of collaboration. Most psets are done in small groups of friends (and this doesn't require you to have those friends in advance - very often your friend groups are born out of the people you work with in classes) and people are often happy to share their ideas with you if you ask nicely. This is pretty unique as far as colleges in the US go, especially ones at the level of Yale. For many people I know, this was the major deciding factor in why they decided to attend Yale.
2. Absolutely not! 15 years ago, sure. But a decade ago our former president, President Levin, set aside $10B for expansion of the sciences at Yale, so there's constantly new labs being opened up, new resources being made available, etc. A good example is the new building being built on Science Hill, the Yale Science Building, which is going to be an interdisciplinary research space with a greenhouse and aquarium. It's set to open in 2019 :) Don't let Yale's reputation as a liberal arts school make you think it has weak science programs. If you want to ask me about specifics, my PMs are open. I've had some great experiences with Nobel Laureates that I'm happy to share.
3. Yes, undergraduates do research at Yale. I think the figure is around 95% of STEM majors that engage in research at some point? Finding a lab is the hardest part because there are so many options, but nine times out of ten if you reach out to a prof and ask to join their lab, they'll be happy to meet with you and discuss projects you could be put on. Importantly, this is independent of prior research experience - I did research for 4 years in HS and won some science fairs, a friend of mine did no research before coming to campus, and we both got into labs 2 weeks into our freshman year and got published a month apart the winter of our sophomore years. All you need is initiative to reach out to a prof and you'll find a place easily.
4. It isn't quite so simple as correlating an ethnicity with statistics. Yale uses a holistic approach to admissions, so they'll consider everything about you (ethnicity is part of it, but there's much more than your race that makes you you!) when deciding if you're a good match for Yale. I can tell you that your stats are definitely good and fall within the range that Yale normally accepts. However, be aware international students *do* have a harder time getting into Yale than domestic students. (This is true of nearly all universities in the US, though.) You should worry less about your stats and more about how you can create a story that sells you as a good candidate for admission to Yale. What beyond your stats makes you a good fit?

You are correct to point out that these processes can adversely affect memory and other cognitive functions - and that this can have an effect on self-care and more general functioning. While there are yet no specific medications of clear impact on these cognitive problems in psychotic disorders there are treatments (including medications) that can help reduce their consequences. Also, specific cognitive training approaches (often including computer based exercises) are being developed by many research groups to specifically target these problems.

**Q:** What proportion of people with psychosis become violent if untreated? Are there any signs to tell if a psychotic person will be more prone to becoming violent?

**A:** The risk for violence (against others) posed by individuals with psychotic disorders is very low. Often this violence is related to psychotic symptoms and treatable. However, as your question suggests, it is very important to know and understand the signs of agitation in a person with psychosis, so that it can be managed without force when possible. We advise families and caregivers to involve clinicians early if they see signs of agitation and are worried about violence towards objects, others or (more commonly) self-harm. Connecticut (and other States) have an excellent program of Crisis Intervention Teams wherein police departments have officers who are trained to collaborate with mental health professionals to ensure that disruptive behaviors enacted by individuals with psychosis are managed safely in the community with careful handoff to treatment facilities/emergency rooms rather than the criminal justice system. Bottom line, individuals with psychosis can be confused, terrified and find themselves feeling quite isolated and this can lead to agitation and sometimes to unfortunate violence. Much of the time the last outcome can be prevented but this requires a wide community effort: informed caregivers, police departments and clinics that interface well with all these stakeholders in a regional network of care.

**Q:** Does Marijuana use play a role in developing or exhibiting psychosis?

**A:** Evidence from population and laboratory studies indicated that Marijuana use increases the risk for developing psychosis, and the risk appears to be greater if the first exposure to Marijuana is at a younger age (adolescence vs. later adulthood). Some sub-groups appear to be at greater risk than others  -hence there will always be individuals who use quite heavily but do not become psychotic - but these sub-groups are not yet detectable by easily available laboratory testing or clinical profiles.

For those who are able to abstain from hashish, sometimes the psychosis resolves either completely (allowing discontinuation of antispsychotic medications) or more commonly, the psychosis reduces enough that individuals can be managed on lower doses of antipsychotics that are more comfortable to take. At this point - in the absence of laboratory tests - the only way to tell which applies to you is to attempt an extended abstinence from marijuana (consider getting the help of healthcare providers to cope with withdrawal symptoms but also to help you develop ways to avoid returning to habits of use) while continuing treatment with your mental health clinicians.",1,,False,e6o8kb6,True,False,1537973166.0,2018-09-26 09:46:06
"I am Vinod Srihari, a psychiatrist who cares about psychosis and the director of MindMap - AMA!",mindmapct,"'Psychosis' is a useful umbrella term for a syndrome (a recognizable pattern of signs and symptoms) that includes features of mental life that most of the rest of us do not experience (distortions of our appreciation of reality: like hallucinations and delusions, and severe disorganization of thought or behavior). Often the term 'psychosis' is used to refer just to these phenomena, and confusingly, 'psychotic disorders' also include other changes that can cause problems for patients: so-called 'deficit' syndrome features like the loss of interest in prior activities, reductions in spontaneous speech and social withdrawal. Finally these disorders can also include cognitive difficulties (memory, planning) and also features that look very much like mania or depression.

Some or all of these features can occur by themselves or together in childhood (more commonly, mild perceptual disturbances) but psychotic disorders (like Schizophrenia) are very rare before the age of 16. So for children with these experiences, it makes sense to respond with careful evaluation by a trained professional, avoiding premature conclusions about diagnosis or treatment and careful follow-up. Most will not have a chronic illness but those who will stand to benefit immensely from early intervention.

If by adolescence you mean 16 and above, this inaugurates an epoch of life (16-25) when most chronic mental illnesses will onset. Again, most individuals who have one feature of the above broad syndrome are likely not going to have chronic illnesses, but should receive careful evaluation as early treatment for a range of new onset chronic illnesses (Depression, Bipolar Disorder, OCD, Schizophrenia) will likely make a big impact. To be sure, intervention at any stage helps.

We counsel families based on the individual presentation (signs, symptoms), course of onset and level of distress and dysfunction. Information is a key variable in improving outcomes and we think this should be available to all who are in the caregiving community for a young person - as many as the person will allow in to the interaction with our clinic. The content of such counseling can touch on topics that include the neurobiology and treatment of these experiences and illnesses, the psychosocial approaches (including psychotherapy and supported education and employment) that can assist young people in getting back on their feet after the disruption of illness onset, and a range of other connections with community supports to ensure that young people suffering from a range of mental distress and/or illness, receive the best that society can offer to help them along.   ",1,,False,e6blw38,True,False,1537457556.0,2018-09-20 10:32:36
"I am Vinod Srihari, a psychiatrist who cares about psychosis and the director of MindMap - AMA!",mindmapct,"1. In the case of recent onset symptoms, medications (the so-called 'antipsychotics') often can significantly reduce or even completely remove hallucinations. Individuals of course vary in their response to medications and also in the extent to which hallucinations are distressing or disabling and thus might choose to focus their treatment team on other areas to target/prioritize.
2. This is a great question for which there are likely as many answers as there are individuals with hallucinations. But some broad principles come to mind from my experience. For those who have some awareness that the hallucinations are an added feature - a new addition good or bad - to their mental life, it is often useful to open up a conversation about what sense they make of them, how they interact (or not) with them and perhaps most important in my role as their physician, whether or not it impacts adversely on their lives. The latter can be a complex discussion. Hallucinations can be, at different times or at the same time in the same individual, both reassuring as well as oppressive. When pleasant to the individual they may nevertheless be distracting or otherwise cause social disability (family and friends may withdraw from someone who is loudly talking to themselves) in ways that the person may need to be made to consider in the context of a trusting therapeutic relationship. Medications can be one tool that the individual can wield - with their treater's support - in a wider range of responses to these mental experiences. There are a range of standard psychotherapeutic strategies to 'cope' with the anxiety or even push back at the oppressive and sometimes commanding features of oppressive voices, but all of these become fully available and useful often only over time and in the context of a working therapeutic alliance with a treater who understands the background, wishes and capacities of the individual. I have learned more about the various and creative ways to manage persistent hallucinations from my patients than from textbooks.
3. Yes, but. And it is a big but. There is good evidence that a variety of sources of stress, including trauma of various kinds, increase the risk for psychotic disorders at a population level. This risk usually needs to interact with an already present risk (i.e. inherited, genetic risk) in order for a psychotic disorder to become manifest. While caring better for our children and reducing severe trauma can be of value for its own sake, and can reduce psychosis risk, it is important to emphasize that bad parenting or even traumatic childhood events do not, by themselves,cause psychosis.",1,,False,e6blyi9,True,False,1537457611.0,2018-09-20 10:33:31

There are theories of auditory verbal hallucinations (or voices) that suggest that they arise due to dysfunctions of speech processing. Our late colleague Ralph Hoffman was one of the early proponents of this idea (1). When we say processing, we mean both production and reception of language – speaking and hearing. We think that when we produce thoughts or actions or speech, we predict the sensory consequences of engaging in that production. We compare the actual consequences with our predictions and, if things match up, we feel we were the authors of the thought or action or speech. If they don’t we might conclude that the thought, or action, or speech had an external source and so we experience our thoughts as hallucinated speech. There is some evidence that this is true, from the work of Judith Ford, Dan Mathalon (2,3) and Katy Thakkar (4) among others. Here at Yale, we take this further. We think all perception is an inference, our best guess as to the sources of our sensory experiences (inside and outside of us). The circuits in the brain that are engaged during such inferences are the same as those engaged when we listen to speech, when we speak and when people hallucinate (5). The specific problem in this circuitry though, the thing that makes people hear things that are not present is, we think an over reliance on what we have come to expect in the world relative to our current sensory inputs so that percepts happen when there is really no input. Your question about sensory loss then makes sense in light of this idea. If your sensory processing (or language processing) is unreliable or noisy, then you will rely more on what you have learned from the past and infer that things are consistent with those expectations (6) . This fits too with an illness characterized by visual hallucinations. Charles Bonnet syndrome involves visual hallucinations of objects and small humanoid characters (like elves). It happens when people begin to lose their eye-sight due to progressive retinal disintegration. The higher visual pathways in their brains compensate for the reduced input by filling things in (like the elves) top-down (7). We think voices happen for the same reasons too – a top-down expectation of speech where there is none, driven by noise in your auditory hierarchy, imposed to try to make sense of that noise (8).

"I am Vinod Srihari, a psychiatrist who cares about psychosis and the director of MindMap - AMA!",mindmapct,"This is an important question and your thoughtful phrasing includes many of the likely answers. Multi-antipsychotic prescription can represent unnecessary over-medication, sloppy practice, fear of breakthrough symptoms in otherwise under-resourced care settings and sometimes, thoughtful pharmacologic intervention that is tailored to an individual patient within a shared-decision making ethos. Overall, well controlled population studies do not support the practice of using more than one antipsychotic for most patients. Some sub-groups though likely benefit from combinations (e..g when the first cannot be brought to a full dose because of dose-related side effects) but these are a minority. Our general approach is serial trials of full doses, which if they do not result in significant improvement (most do), to move on without too much delay to Clozapine. Another consideration always is non-adherence or partial adherence that can masquerade as medication non-response. In these cases a good therapeutic alliance (so that this comes out in the open) and tools like long acting injectables (often favored by college students who do not want to carry around medication bottles) can be very effective.",1,,False,e6bnme7,True,False,1537458965.0,2018-09-20 10:56:05
"I am Vinod Srihari, a psychiatrist who cares about psychosis and the director of MindMap - AMA!",mindmapct,"Your analogy of psychosis to fever is useful. Indeed psychosis is a syndrome that can have many different causes (e.g. infection, seizure disorder, the list goes on...) just like fever. In both cases, the treatment (which can include watchful observation without specific intervention) depends on a good diagnostic evaluation. In both cases, the initial presenting problem may fade without treatment and/or the cause may remain mysterious ('fever of unknown origin'). When psychosis is not due to a known medical cause (e.g. Wilson's disease) and persists, it ends up being classified usually amongst the Schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Like other medical illnesses (e.g. hypertension) - the specific cause may not be known, but we know a lot about how to treat, improve distress, reduce dysfunction and there are clear risks to not treating. Also responses to treatment are variable, but this no cause for pessimism: as with hypertension or diabetes, good treatment makes a significant difference for most, while some are unable to cooperate with treatment and few are unlucky (<10% in the Schizophrenias) to not respond to the best currently available medications, but - this is important - care is still necessary and effective in helping them live as full lives as possible in their communities.

To your final point, it is indeed the case that some choose to decline treatment and remain preoccupied with delusional ideas. Also, our treatments may not help reduce delusional preoccupation even in some who accept treatment. There is still much in the way of care that can be provided, and more often than not, the rest of the person's ideas and general life can proceed in parallel - i.e. the adverse impact of the delusional ideas on general social and vocational functioning can be limited. Treatment or a good therapeutic relationship can be a place to keep conversations about fixed delusions open while monitoring and limiting their adverse impacts.  ",1,,False,e6bqivf,True,False,1537461311.0,2018-09-20 11:35:11

TD can wax and wane and does not always worsen or persist but when it does can present a cosmetic problem at best, or a disabling challenge at worst. There is some evidence that the newer, second generation or so-called ‘atypical’ antipsychotics (e.g. olanzapine, seroquel) may have lower risks for TD than the older medications (e.g. Haldol) and also that lower doses (vs. high doses) might protect against this side effect. Having said this, the discussion of whether or not to change or start a particular antipsychotic will need to be based on an individual assessment of risk vs. benefit.

Coming up for Bulldog Days-- looking for opinions on dorms/dorm food,laxlawe,"Junior, happy to answer questions

1. The residential college system is great.  It provides you with a smaller group of people you easily bond with while you're trying to figure out the whole college thing.  You'll also live together for pretty much the next four years you're forever seeing a friend in the dining hall to go chat with regardless of when you get there, as an illustrative example.  Not sure what you mean about an issue with people moving off campus, we actually have a pretty high percentage of people remain on campus compared to other schools.  Those who move off all come back for dinner Sunday nights and usually hang out in their college though.  

2. I'm pretty sure that as college food goes ours is great.  I used to be in a college without hot breakfast, and I'm in one with it now (volunteered as transplant upperclassman for the new colleges).  Is hot breakfast better?  Yeah, but like you're going to be spending all of 5 minutes on breakfast anyway if you're like any of the other students.  You can also just eat breakfast where there's hot breakfast, there aren't limits on where you can eat (except some dinner hours some days).  

3. I can't really speak to the lack of commons, but I think they're reopening it in fall of 2019 so you'll only be without it for a year.  They've been doing events at another facility and split the dinner last year to make space (half the colleges one day, half the other).  Is it a bummer that it's closed?  Yeah, but something will always be closed for renovation at a school this old (when I got here it was the Beinecke)",12,,False,dxhqhd3,False,False,1523936380.0,2018-04-16 22:39:40

Prospective student questions about SEAS and engineering as a whole,fuzentrix,"Hi there, I'm a sophomore here at Yale majoring in ABET Chemical Engineering so I might be able to answer your questions. I too had a similar choice like you for undergrad and ended up coming to Yale over other more engineering-oriented schools (e.g. Cornell, Michigan, Georgia Tech, etc.).

**1:** This depends 100% on your interests after graduation. Most (But not all) people who come to Yale with interests in engineering are individuals who are interested in either a) a smaller portion of individuals with strong research or industry interests who want to go to graduate school or work in industry, or b) the larger portion of individuals who are interested in combining engineering with economics or have a diverse set of interests such as business, music, etc. that includes engineering. I'll warn you that the engineering department here will not have as much prestige in the engineering world (undergraduate, at least) for when you graduate. This means that less companies come here to recruit, since we have a smaller engineering department with less graduates, and it may make it a little harder for you to find a job (IN ENGINEERING) after you graduate.

That being said, it's very possible to find a great engineering job after you graduate from Yale engineering. The Yale brand name carries you pretty damn far in most cases. I have friends going to work for SpaceX, ExxonMobil, Tesla, DuPont, Google, Apple, and going on to prestigious graduate schools such as Caltech, MIT, UC Berkeley, etc. for their PhDs. It's just that you have to put in a little extra work to see out the opportunities you want in engineering here in order to achieve them, while at other more engineering-oriented top schools (e.g. Stanford, MIT, ...) employers will come to you since those schools have a greater per capita output of engineers. Also, if you ever decide to go into finance, consulting, medicine, investment banking, etc. and your interests change (don't rule them out, since ~50% of people change their majors in college), Yale's brand name goes super super far in getting your foot in the door in these types of jobs. It's kind of shitty, but the brand name often matters a lot in things like internships, job applications, grad school applications, etc. and that's the world we live in. So even if you're purely interested in engineering jobs and nothing else, the brand name is still more than helpful in these sorts of areas, and you never know when it might serve you well. I can't really say the same for other engineering-oriented schools, unless you're deciding between schools of the likes of Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Caltech. If you're 100% sure you want to do engineering and nothing else and you have those schools on your decision plate as well, I would choose one of those over Yale. If not, then I think Yale is the better choice here from what I've said. The financial aid here (not sure if that's a factor, but it was for me) is amazing.
**EDIT**: I saw in your post history that Case Western is the school you're deciding against with some waitlists and that it'll be 25k cheaper per year for you. Please don't come to Yale if it's going to put you 100k in debt over 4 years unless your family has enough money to pay for you in that case. If you're just looking to get an engineering degree and save as much money as you can for your family, go with the cheaper school. If you're well off enough to consider both, then I think Yale is the better choice because of the connections this school gives you and the environment as I talk about below. 

I personally am interested in getting my PhD right after graduation, and the research community is very good in engineering because there's a smaller, more intimate setting for engineering here and professors get to know their students much better. For example, if I had gone to a larger engineering school, I know for a fact that I wouldn't have been able to publish multiple papers as an undergraduate because the professors there are much more concerned with their graduate students than their undergraduates. Here, you get to know all of the people in your major and it's really easy to find people to work with on problem sets, collaborate, do research, etc. It's a very nice environment with no competition as compared to some of the larger schools you might find in engineering. That's another great benefit of the smaller engineering community at Yale.

**2:** The biggest problems right now in SEAS is mostly just a lack of investment in some specific areas, such as course offerings and bringing companies to campus for recruitment. Some courses may only be offered every other year, but this usually only applies for the upper-level electives in engineering (e.g. if you wanted to take Aerodynamics for MechE, or advanced fluid mechanics, or something like that). The core classes for every major are offered every year. Also see my comment above about not as many MechE/ChemE/EE companies coming to campus as a negative as well, due to the lower number of engineers here. CS companies come here very often though, and investment banking/consulting/finance/etc. are here all the time.

However, if you start out as engineering, take all of your requirements, and are on top of what you want to do, this isn't an issue at all because by the time you're a sophomore or junior, you'll definitely be able to take all the electives you want and more. As I mentioned previously about the job marketing thing, most of our SEAS career fairs are oriented toward Computer Science right now (since it's super hot and one of the fastest-growing/highest paid majors here), so you usually see more Google/Facebook/Apple/etc. rather than the traditional MechE, ChemE, or EE companies (like aerospace, HVAC, chemical companies, you know. you do see them at our career fairs, but not as high proportion). But as I said as well, it's more than possible to pursue and get prestigious industry internships in these fields as long as you reach out to alums, market yourself, and take the courses you need to take. I would definitely 100% advise you to go ABET engineering if you're sure you want to work as an engineer after graduation, cause that's the only degree people respect in that world and you need it if you ever want to work for a company that has ties to the government. If you're more interested in finance, consulting, etc. you can easily just do an economics major and combine it with one of the BA in Engineering Sciences degrees that people do here if they're in that route.

The benefits of Yale engineering are mainly the small classes and professors knowing you well, the money there is to work in engineering clubs (Aerospace, Bulldogs Racing, etc.), the brand name, and the environment of incredibly intelligent people here. Yale students are incredibly smart, and the environment is much more academically inclined than you might find at some other less selective schools, just because the students who come here were mostly at the top of their classes in high school and are very driven. Engineering clubs are great ways to do hands-on projects and get experience when you're applying to internships.

I'm going to link you to someone else's comment about Yale engineering on this subreddit here:(https://www.reddit.com/r/yale/comments/3xgt54/yale_engineering/cy4oxja/)
I don't think all of what he said applies now since he wrote this 2 years ago, but it's a moderately accurate description of what I was saying earlier. Basically, engineers at Yale are a self-selecting group who do very well because they know what they want and pursue it with all of the resources they have here. Most people here aren't engineers, so you'll be exposed to many different fields other than engineering, which I can't really say if you went to a tech school. That can most often be a good thing because it encourages you to step outside your comfort zone. 

Also, a note: if you come here, and want to work as an engineer, DO THE ABET DEGREE. That's the most rigorous form of the engineering degree you can, and it's the only one engineering employers care about. We don't offer Civil Engineering like you said you were interested in, but we do offer ABET Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. If you want to do environmental, just major in ABET ChemE and take environmental electives because trust me it'll make job placement a lot easier for you. We also have Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering, and Environmental Engineering. Don't do biomedical unless you really want graduate school or want to go to medical school. Lots of people going to work for Facebook and Google now from here because of increased enrollment and recruitment on campus in CS.

PM me if you want to talk, happy to help!

**TL;DR:** Yale engineering is good for people who know what they want and are willing to pursue it. Come to Yale if you a) aren't deciding between Stanford, MIT, Caltech, Princeton level prestige engineering schools or b) if you have a diverse set of interests that you want to explore along with engineering, like in humanities, business, etc. The upper level elective classes here are very small in numbers so you get to know everyone, you should definitely pursue ABET engineering degree if you want to work as an engineer, and Yale has tons of money you can get to do club projects and internships. Industry and research are both more than available, you just have to work a little more to get them for yourself. The people here on average are much more dedicated and intelligent than those you'll see at most schools, and they'll push you to work hard and learn a lot. It's an intimate environment with professors getting to know you and the brand name goes a long way in most areas you might be interested in during school or after graduation, along with the connections it can provide you.",7,,1522719085.0,dwpc9el,False,False,1522717502.0,2018-04-02 20:05:02

I will add, however, that if you are put into a double, you are not stuck in that situation for the entire year. If you have a very bad roommate or if you do experience severe anxiety because of your living situation, you can talk with your FroCo and Residential College Dean and they will likely move you to a medical single. I've had a few friends who moved into singles part-way into their first year at Yale. If you live on Old Campus, it will most likely be in a different building than the other students in your college—perhaps McClellan Hall—but you will have some peace of mind.

Finally, congratulations on being accepted! Remember how you're feeling right now. It's an incredibly special feeling, and embrace it before Yale becomes your new normal! 

Edit: I also wanted to respond to /u/Kovarian. If you do end up in a double, don't go in expecting or hoping that you'll just never see or deal with your roommate much. While it is possible, it's unlikely to happen, at least to the extent that Kovarian experienced. Moreover, when it doesn't happen, you'll be left disappointed. I had a bad freshman year roommate. It sucked, but I learned a lot from the experience and got a few good stories that always get some laughs. ",7,,1518362528.0,du2yu6e,False,False,1518362154.0,2018-02-11 09:15:54

Or imagine the plight of a Yemeni student - your parents could be barred from coming to visit you in this country, and to visit them there could be risking your life. Before the election, they could hold out hope that their parents would be able to immigrate and escape the desolation, but now those hopes are dashed, and that carries a period of mourning.

Now, obviously there will not be many students in those sorts of situations, but from the professor's letter, he seemed to be aware of enough of them that he did the compassionate thing.

Also, this profesor's choice was much more in light of the *reactions* to the election, not simply that the  students stayed up late.

However, I would say that EEB and EVST make it pretty easy to pursue research and take courses abroad, especially during the summer—Yale has a collection of preapproved courses available for abroad credit (and major requirements) and I have personally received funding from EVST to study an EEB field project over at the Yale Myers forest over summer. The DUS of EEB, Stephen Stearns, is quite a forceful personality but is very accessible and has given me quite a lot of genuine advice and resources.

Thankfully, early requirements are pretty similar and I recommend knocking em out (especially bio and general chem if necessary) so that once your plans solidify more as you progress you can start to seriously consider if you want to pursue more research (EEB) or social impact (EVST), not that the major will limit your ability fully to do either.",1,,False,fwj24ab,False,False,1593559403.0,2020-06-30 18:23:23

Yale vs. Columbia (Prospective Student),fuzentrix,"I am a senior in engineering at Yale who can speak to grad school and STEM at Yale - since our STEM community is on the smaller side for undergrad, it is great since it allows for smaller class sizes and a plethora of research opportunities for undergrads. Research experience is the primary factor that PhD programs use to evaluate undergrads for admission, and Yale allows (and funds) undergrad research like crazy. This means that the vast majority of Yale students who apply to top PhD programs are routinely accepted. I would recommend looking [here](https://undergradresearch.yale.edu/) or [here](https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/fellowships/fellowship-grants) for more information on undergraduate research. I've done research here since my freshman year (including summers) and have received ample funding for all the research I've done. Working long-term in research labs also allows for the opportunity to co-author publications as an undergrad, which is great for PhD admissions. 

Look [here](https://astronomy.yale.edu/research) for more information about the research going on at Yale in astrophysics. In terms of astrophysics, some labs I would recommend checking out that involve undergrads in research:

Yale vs. Columbia (Prospective Student),diaphanousphoton,"Yale physics major here! I don’t know a lot about Columbia’s program, but I’ve been very happy with the physics and astronomy departments at Yale. To echo what other people have said, it’s easy to get involved in research early on and there’s a lot of money available for it. I’ve been doing research with a theoretical and computational cosmology group for the last three years, and Yale paid for me to do research abroad last summer! 

One of the nice things about Yale is that there’s a pretty tight-knit community among physics and astronomy undergrads (especially the astro majors since there are usually < 10 per year). There are two active undergraduate groups in the department— Yale Women in Physics and the Society of Physics Students. Both are focused on community-building, mentoring, and trying to make physics at Yale more welcoming and diverse. WiP just hosted a 200-person conference for undergraduate women in physics, and SPS organizes special lectures every semester where they invite famous physicists to speak and interact with undergrads (the last two, Wolfgang Ketterle and Duncan Haldane, are both Nobel laureates). 

Also, I definitely appreciate the flexibility in Yale’s requirements. There are always unique ways to fulfill your distribution requirements— there’s a class called “The Anthropology of Outer Space” that fulfills the social science credit, and a lot of advanced labs count as writing credits.

Yale vs. Columbia (Prospective Student),Someone856,"Hello! I'm an incoming freshman who got in early and was also looking at Columbia.

It felt like one of Columbia's main selling points was that they are in NYC, which is obviously something that Yale isn't. One thing I'd recommend though is to look at how long it takes to get to places in the city you'd like to visit. Going on the train to the high line made me realize that it would be a lot harder for me get to other parts of the city than I thought it would be. Talking to some people there made it sound like they have to plan ahead to find the time to get to other parts of the city. 

My take was that if I wanted to plan ahead to go times square or something, I could get on the Northeast regional train from New Haven and make a day trip out of it. Would it be longer and more expensive? Yes. Do I think I would get into the city any less than I would if I went to Columbia? No.

Question about the new Jackson School of Global Affairs,tdTomato,"I haven't heard of any plans to build a new building. The Jackson Institute/School was always meant to be a small community. So it probably won't expand until it has to.

&#x200B;

Many students are upset that Yale has decided to pour $200M into the Jackson School while it has bigger current issues to worry about: The Department of Ethnicity, Race, and Migration (ER&M) is dying, and Yale is refusing to remove the Student Income Contribution (SIC). As a recipient of financial aid, I feel the pain of the SIC. However, I understand that Yale is legally required to found the Jackson School due to a contract signed with the primary donor 10 years ago.

&#x200B;

Another issue is that the Jackson School is the second building at Yale named after a living donor. (The first building in general named after a living donor was the Schwarzman Center, after Steve Schwarzman '69). Yale has historically balked at doing this. Even Charles Johnson '54 with his $250M donation couldn't sway Yale to name a new residential college after him. However, I personally don't see this broken naming tradition as much of a problem.

&#x200B;

Also, there are first-year seminars you apply to as break starts to end, as well as a few residential college seminars you apply to prior to the end of break (but you won't likely get into those as a first-year).

You should get to live in a dorm at BDD, keep in mind that there are a few significant variations in quality. However, as a general rule of thumb, the colleges that get shit on the most for their dorms make up for it with especially cult-like communities, so you really can't lose.

Computational Biology at Yale?,VaguelyRelevant,"While you're right that there's no explicit computational biology major, the largest biology major at Yale (MCDB) does have a strong [quantitative biology track](https://mcdb.yale.edu/quantitative-biology). Some professors to keep in mind might be Thierry Emonet, Joe Howard, Damon Clark, or Kathryn Miller-Jensen. There are some awesome courses like the Dynamical Systems in Biology sequence (MCDB330/MCDB361) that use MATLAB to model complex biological systems. 

In bioinformatics specifically, there are some great higher level courses offered every year like MCDB425 that deal more narrowly with handling big data in genetics. Professors like Jun Lu will be relevant there.

Double majoring in CS might be one way to do things, but that's definitely not the only approach. I'd focus on reaching out to professors that do work in the specific subfield that interests you most and getting research experience under your belt. Also, don't be afraid to take graduate courses - they're often much lower workload than undergraduate courses and tend to be more focused on practical applications rather than big themes.

Computational Biology at Yale?,luigi2yoshi,"I started out as an mcdb major but  became super interested in computational biology this year. While there's no major in it, there is a quantitative biology ""track"" (don't ask me what weight the tracks hold, who knows) in the mcdb major, but it has you take three or four extra classes related to quantitative biology (pretty much the only classes they have that are explicitly about computational methods in biology) while the rest of the mcdb curriculum isn't focused on computation but genetics, biochem, molecular, etc. Lots of pre meds in the major. So if computational bio is what you're interested in you'll probably learn more by doing independent research with a professor, and it's fairly easy to get one of those opportunities. We have a few decent names, they're just scattered across various departments, but there's a lot of interesting research to be done. You'll probably do a lot of planning your own curriculum, deciding which classes might be beneficial for learning about comp bio even if they don't count toward your major. I personally lost interest in the mcdb major, but it's your call how much you like the bio curriculum and whether you want to pursue it (I personally thought it was limiting and not very interdisciplinary, but you might wanna check out the website to see the program for the major). I'm more interested in the computational part than the biology part so I switched to math and I'm just taking bio and cs classes on the side. My personal take is that computational bio is such an interdisciplinary field that it doesn't really matter what you major in as long as it can be somehow related (i.e. any STEM). Double majoring in C.S. and bio sounds really hard but if you can swing it kudos to you. I'd say it's probably not worth it, both hard majors alone plus yale intentionally makes it hard to double major, but your call.

Thoughts on Yale CS?,Kovarian,"I have heard good things about the program, but other than dabbling in the more humanities-focused ""ideas of CS"" classes, I wasn't involved in the major. So I can't speak to that.

But I can speak to cultural visibility on campus. It's there, about on par with other majors. I knew quite a few CS majors, despite not being in the program. They weren't isolated, but also weren't the focus of the campus (there really wasn't one). They were just another major.

Part of what makes Yale different from other schools (or so I've heard) is that there isn't a lot of division between the majors. In some schools, the CS students stay with other CS students, the psych majors stay with psych, and so on. But I had no close friends in my major, and had close friends in at least five different other ones. Your major has a comparatively minimal effect on your social life. It has some, sure, but not as much as elsewhere.",12,,False,e790d9q,False,False,1538788398.0,2018-10-05 20:13:18

Versus Yale, the schools you list (Princeton's somewhat smaller) have more diverse CS course and research offerings, more CS majors, and probably better CS cultures in terms of people hacking on things, but I think the strong undergrad experience here compensates for weaker STEM departments.

I have my Yale on campus interview tomorrow. Any advice?,Ziddletwix,"I have no special qualification to give advice here, so take it with a grain of salt. But think of it as a conversation, not an interview. What I mean is that you don't need to show off your resume here. The interviewer isn't going to write in their note ""Well, they never mentioned community service that they've done"". The admissions committee are the ones who will read all of your  accomplishments in full, and will evaluate you accordingly. The purpose of the interview is for them to actually *talk* to you as a person.

That's not to say you have to go out of your way to be humble. It's an interview, feel free to ""sell"" yourself when you have a chance. But the primary goal has to be to try and have a memorable conversation. A lot of candidates feel like they have to ""cover everything"" that makes them a great applicant. Again, all of that will be seen by the admissions committee, there's no need to worry about omitting something impressive. They talk to a lot of candidates, they all have suitably impressive backgrounds, so your list of accomplishments probably isn't going to stand out from the pack. 

Again, that doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to be humble. It just means focus on the *conversation* over listing the parts of your resume. If there's a natural opportunity, steer the conversation to something you're passionate about, because that's the best way to be compelling and stick in the interviewer's mind. 

Honestly, this is ultimately a test of whether they *like* you. And that probably doesn't sound very fair, but it's true. So things like smile, be cheerful, friendly, and engaged. They are not going to grudgingly give you a good review (""They rubbed me the wrong way, but they did have some amazing state trophies""). They're just going to relay whether or not they liked you or not.

That being said, luckily the bottom line is to *not worry* too much because interviews are just one tiny part of your application. You will not guarantee yourself admission by knocking this interview out of the park. And if you come off poorly, you haven't sunk your application either. This is just one tiny part of the process. I think people tend to overvalue the interview because it *feels* like it's the part they have the most direct control over (I mean, you're actually talking to someone representing the school one on one!). But it's just one small part out of many. Don't stress yourself out because you think this is your one chance to get into this school. For better or worse, the vast majority of the time, the interview won't make a difference! 

Luckily, all you have to do is try and have an interesting conversation. I guarantee you're an interesting enough person, and the interviewer will generally let you steer the interview to something you're passionate about. Show that passion! If you're nervous, find some sample questions online and think of some basic answers to those. You don't need to be incredibly creative, you don't need to be the *only* candidate this interviewer remembers. You just need them to write down something reasonably positive that they send to the office. Interviewers aren't terribly harsh people in my opinion, they're predisposed to like you, and are just looking to see if there's someone who is incapable of holding a basic conversation. 

And again, I can't repeat it enough, this is a very small part of your application. It's very unlikely that your interview performance will determine your application outcome for better or worse. And good luck! 

Edit: I'm not sure why I wrote out that long rambling rant honestly, I just got going and had to say. But this was just a narrow perspective on the context of the interview in the application. Other people can offer more practical advice. The most important advice to start with is to learn about Yale *specifically*. You can't just explain why going to a good school would be important to you. You have to explain why *Yale* would be perfect for you. Make sure you know *why* Yale is a better fit for you over peer institutions. Find some things that Yale is proud of, and relate it to your application. There's much more to say on that I'm sure, but I felt remiss writing this whole ramble without mentioning such fundamental advice that people often get wrong for interviews. Learn about the place you're interviewing for! The easiest way to come across poorly in the interview is to act like you don't know anything about Yale besides the fact that it's a good school.

I have my Yale on campus interview tomorrow. Any advice?,Arboretum7,"I've been a Yale alumni interviewer in the past. Four pieces of advice that I’ve given on this sub before:

First, above all else, demonstrate curiosity and a relentless pursuit of passions. There are plenty of applicants that are good at playing the game of high school, but the ones that shine doggedly pursue interests beyond normal bounds. By way of example, tell me a story about how you learned about something in high school and then followed that interest out in the real world, maybe by becoming an active leader in a political cause, taking university courses, starting a new club, challenging the rules of your community, etc. They want to see how you left your mark on your community because Yale is looking for students that will challenge and augment it's campus, not just consume what it has to offer. The last time I looked at the essay questions on the application, they were all around this theme.

Second, try to highlight a story about service. Yale is big on giving back to the community, so highlight how you've done this in yours. Talk about a specific problem in your community and how you've worked to alleviate it. One point here, it's en vogue to take service trips to other countries. I've heard about how going to build a school in Guatemala for a week changed peoples' perspectives ad nauseam. While cool, it doesn't demonstrate a sustained interest in a cause or a rooting in community and your interviewer has heard a lot of stories about similar trips.

Third, highlight what makes you unique and preferably a little quirky. Like the service trip point above, avoid stories or topics that might be common. If you're asked what your favorite book is, don't talk about something that was assigned reading. I had one year where a third of my interviewees gushed about One Hundred Years of Solitude. It didn't take long to figure out that that was assigned reading in AP English. Similarly, I'd rather hear about a passionate jazz harmonica player than another violinist. If you're a little quirky, I'll remember you. Also, don’t tell a story that you already covered in one of your essays. The interviewer is going to write up a 1-2 page report on you and rank you on a scale of 1-9 based on how they feel you would have compared with their own classmates. That report is sent to admissions and added to your application which is reviewed as a whole. You have a limited amount of space to make an impression so don’t duplicate what’s already in your file.

Fourth, “why Yale?” is always a question, so prep for that and show real passion about going there. I disagree with the other commenter who said you’re interviewing us as much as we’re interviewing you. Alumni who are volunteering to interview do it because they loved their time at Yale and are more than a little nostalgic about it. It’s not a school to us, it’s fucking Hogwarts! In our minds there’s nothing else like it. If you show up to the interview without having done your research, acting like you might rather go to Princeton or without any questions about our experience, it’s easy for us to feel like you won’t appreciate receiving what we feel was an incredible gift in our own lives. So, show us you really want it, know about differentiators like the residential college system, don’t ask questions that you can look up online and dig into the interviewer’s own experience a bit.

Interview prep can also be really helpful. Especially with EA candidates, this is often the applicant's first interview for anything and they’re understandably nervous. Remember we're regular people and we all had to go through a Yale interview too. If you have an adult in your life who regularly interviews job applicants at work, ask them to practice some behavioral interview questions with you (e.g. ""tell me about a time you faced a difficult problem and how you went about tackling it""). Practice giving responses where you set a context and then talk about actions you took and the results they garnered. Oh, also, don't let your parents anywhere near the interview, dress in your normal clothes, know that we haven’t seen your application and don't bring a resume.

Anyhow, hope that helps! Feel free to PM me with any questions. Good luck!",5,,1532074469.0,e2pg720,False,False,1532059170.0,2018-07-19 22:59:30

Math 120/230 and Physics 200/260,hitherescotty,"I tried to skip a level with Math when I was a freshman. It was not a good idea...

I'm not sure what your high school is like, but the caliber of student at Yale is obviously very high. You won't be the only smart kid in the class anymore.

And there are a lot of new variables that come into play when you first start college. You'll probably be going to parties and trying out new activities and possibly spending less time on scholastics than you do now.

In my opinion, you're better off staying in comfortable territory or even leveling DOWN and taking courses that will be easier for you. Honestly, I wish someone had given me this advice when I started at Yale. It would have changed my whole experience. I thought I was academically invincible and had a sort of rude awakening at the end of the first semester.

You have four years to try lots of different things - academic and extra-curricular. There's a good chance your major will change many times and your scholastic preferences will evolve. 

I realize this sounds pessimistic, but it really isn't. The most valuable things I learned at Yale were about people and interpersonal connections. You WANT to have time to explore those things, so don't force yourself into an overwhelming courseload right away. There's plenty of time for that over the next few years. 

Get ready for the best four years of your life! I'm so jealous - I wish I could do it all again :)

Tl;dr: Be conservative and don't over-exert yourself out the gate course-wise. You'll learn how much you can handle as you adapt to being at Yale. Leveling down one course is not a big deal. ",14,,1530550804.0,e1ncouc,False,False,1530523713.0,2018-07-02 04:28:33
Math 120/230 and Physics 200/260,Draksis314,"I second u/hitherescotty to say that it's important to stay in comfortable territory when you first come to Yale. You'll be in a totally new social environment, and it's way easier to grow socially when you're not dying academically.

That said, I would also encourage you to be brave academically in areas that you're comfortable in -- even freshman year! A lot of my best friendships today come from working on MATH 230/PHYS 260 problem sets with friends late at night. I know students who took MATH 230 and switched from art history to math, and I know students who took MATH 230 and switched from math to art history.

To elaborate on MATH 230/PHYS 260 specifically: I do feel the difficulty of each of these classes is overhyped, or at least it was when I took them. For MATH 230, comfort with proofs is far more important than any multivariable calculus experience. The first semester (MATH 230) is mostly pretty basic analysis, so epsilon-delta proofs, proofs from axioms, etc. The second semester (MATH 231) gets more a bit more challenging and delves into some multivariable calculus, but by then you'll be more warmed up to Yale. I wouldn't describe either as unbearably difficult or anything if you have prior proof experience, in fact I'd say it's among the couple easiest math classes I've taken at Yale! I feel similarly about PHYS 260 -- when I took it, the first semester was a fair amount of review from AP Physics. That said, I would say familiarity with multivariable is a pretty big plus for PHYS 260. If you're curious to know more about the specific academic experiences of either of these classes, feel free to DM me or reply to this message with more details on your background and I can try to provide guidance :)

If you're considering majoring in either of these subjects, I would encourage you to *try* to take MATH 230/PHYS 260 for a few reasons: 1) it'll set you up better academically for the rest of the classes in the major, 2) you'll get to know the others who might be in your major, and 3) you might find out you hate them and don't actually want to major in it. But, if you don't think taking MATH 230/PHYS 260 is right for you, there's tons of math/physics majors that didn't take those so don't stress.

To conclude, though, I want to reiterate some of u/hitherescotty's points. I've written most of this assuming that you consider math/physics to be your stronger subjects. If not, I'd recommend going with the easier classes. Personally, I took tough classes in math+physics+French during my freshman year at Yale. While math and physics went great, I had a really tough time in my French class and I wish I had taken an easier course. French wasn't in my comfort zone, and in retrospect I shouldn't have pushed myself too hard there.

I hope that helps -- let me know if you have any other questions!",3,,False,e1p90b6,False,False,1530592238.0,2018-07-02 23:30:38
Math 120/230 and Physics 200/260,AmbidextrousAxolotl,"I'm late to the post here but thought I'd share my (somewhat strong) opinions on Math 230 and Phys 260, having taken both this past year.

I highly recommend Math 230. The professor (Pat Devlin) is a great first-year math professor. He really works hard to get to know the students and create a community out of his class. The course content is interesting and the pace is rigorous enough that you'll be well prepared for future math courses. Considering you describe yourself as having quite a good math background, I think you would be dissapointed by Math 120.

I did not enjoy Physics 260. However, note that the professor last year (Baltay) is teaching a different course this year, so this feedback may be irrelevant if the new professor is better. I found the course content to be kind of ""filler"" meaning that it's not really necessary for the next couple years of physics, and it doesn't really build upon what we learned in HS physics. Considering you don't have as much background in physics, I would recommend 200 (especially if Sarah Demers is teaching it this year - she may just be the spring 201 teacher, but that would still make it worth it.

Math 120/230 and Physics 200/260,justanotheryalie,"These are really good points. I wanted to add though, that there are plenty of math intensive majors who don't take PHYS260 and there are many physics intensive majors who don't take MATH230. Sometimes people come into Yale with misconceptions about how hard you need to go in fields adjacent to your major - generally what you imagine is more than what you need to be successful, so don't push yourself too hard if it doesn't feel right. Go easy freshman year - it sets you up to have a happier Yale experience. First impressions count. 

Early on though, I would decide whether you think you might want to go to grad school in either physics or math, and if so, make sure you are on track for the intensive major. I could be wrong, but from what I gathered, the standard and intensive track diverge pretty early on. It's much easier to drop down than to try and jump up. 

Another thing is that a fair number of advanced math students coming into Yale decide to skip MATH230 and take upper-level electives instead. This seems to be rarer in physics - there are people who place into the 400 level classes, but it is extremely uncommon. ",4,,False,e1pgv4w,False,False,1530604933.0,2018-07-03 03:02:13

Not sure about the other colleges. But they’re probably in between.

Coming to Yale in the Fall,tormis,"Grad student here. Not sure if you are a grad or undergrad so take my answers with a grain of salt.

1) Not sure about filmmaking/photography opportunities. I'm sure they exist, I'm just not aware of them.

2) Biking around NH is the best way to get around. I live in East Rock, so it's really helpful given the distance. That being said, depending on your classes and living location, a bike is the fastest way to get around - avoid most traffic, lock up quickly, no parking fees, etc. However, if you're a undergrad and are in any of the residential colleges down by cross campus (i.e. near Sterling Library) and all of your classes are right down there, a bike doesn't make much sense.

3) Winter is pretty mild, at least it was this year. About two weeks in total with substantial amounts of snow on the group. Only two or three times when the university shut down due to snow. Not sure about the summer, but I'm sure it's lovely.

4) Lots of everything. Tons of music (choral, orchestral, band, chamber, a cappella, etc.), art (Yale Art Gallery is incredible, also the Yale Art School is world renowned), and film. Explore the calendars of various departments from the past year to get a better idea. Also, NYC is an easy train or drive (depending on when you leave) so there is obviously a huge amount of things to explore there as well. Also, NH is famous for Pizza (Pepe's, Modern, One Six Three, Da Legna).

5) East Rock is the best. Nice restaurants, great little Italian markets, coffee shops, and a new Brewery (East Rocking Brewery) opening up this summer. Don't know as much about West Rock, but I'm pretty sure it's not nearly as nice as East Rock.

Coming to Yale in the Fall,jazzlecat,"A few extra notes on #3 (as someone who came from southern California): 
1. Winter is harsh if you're not used to snow and freezing wind/rain. Learn to layer, buy waterproof  boots and warms socks. They'll save your life and make you that much happier. 
2. Wait until you're in the Northeast or a place with similar weather to buy your winter gear (boots, coat). Unless you're buying from an outdoor retailer that uses brands specifically meant for cold and rain, clothes sold in tropical climates just won't be made for the colder weather. My California ""coat"" barely made it through October. If you're international (I'm assuming because you said country and not state, sorry if I'm wrong) and doing OIS you'll do a big trip to the local mall and you'll be able to pick stuff up then. 
3. Summer in New Haven is humid and hot. There tend to be kind of unpredictable rain showers in the early summer and it hits peak high heat in July and August. The first few weeks on campus are hot, particularly because buildings on old campus lack AC and the buildings are old, but get a box fan and you'll be fine!

2. Biking is definitely a common way to get around, though definitely not necessary. Useful if you take science classes as those are a bit farther away. 
3. If you're from a more tropical place, winters probably aren't your friend. It usually only gets down to 20s, but can sometimes  go down to teens plus windchill. Would definitely recommend getting a warm jacket and a fuzzy hat. Also if you're biking, definitely invest in one of those face masks to cover your mouth, nose and neck as the wind can really get you. 
4. In general, most of the things you do will be on campus in like clubs or with ppl you meet. New haven doesn't have that much to offer other than some nice restaurants. Mainly if you want to do something off campus, you could take metro north to nyc but otherwise there are tons of things on campus to keep you busy.

"Just sorted (admitted, initiated, what's the word?) into Ezra Stiles",VaguelyRelevant,"To add some more info (I'm a tour guide, so giving you the run down that people normally ask for when they visit):

* Ezra Stiles and Morse are sister residential colleges in the southwest of campus, close to Broadway which is a pretty central commercial hub in New Haven, but pretty far from central campus.
* Ezra Stiles and Morse were designed by Eero Saarinen, the Finnish architect who also designed the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. Very futuristic and post-modern design. Neither residential college has any right angles anywhere, which makes placing your bed a pain but is definitely unique! The suites are also very large and single-heavy which is a great plus.
* Morse and Ezra Stiles share a dining hall (the kitchen is right in between, and there are symmetrical dining areas on both the Morse and ES sides). Morse/ES are more or less acknowledged by the student body to have the best kitchen - you guys will have daily unique specials that aren't offered in other res colleges, plus you have daily pizza made fresh in a brick oven. *So* good.
* If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and check out the [Ezra Stiles website](http://ezrastiles.yalecollege.yale.edu). Be sure to check out the [facilities site](http://ezrastiles.yalecollege.yale.edu/facilities/crescent-underground), which will give you an idea of what sorts of things you'll find in your basement. Reminder, of course, that you'll have access to all the residential colleges, but it's always nice to know what you get bragging rights over :\^)

Stiles is a really convenient location being next to the gym, and you have a shortcut to yale health and to science hill. Also has a really nice gym and dining hall, which always serves pizza. 

Main cons are that it's location makes the dhall a huge draw for athletes, which can make it super crowded at times (dinner after 630 is impossible) on weekdays. Also the ""no right angles"" make the dorm rooms pretty awkward to furnish effectively, but they're generally pretty big anyways so it's not a huge deal.

Why the Yale Hunger Strike Is Misguided,PhD_sock,"A really bad take on this. I don't mean bad as in, ""Oh, she's opposed to it."" I mean bad as in it's illogical and poorly-considered. Note I'm not a Local 33 supporter. I just support the necessity for a graduate student union.

Here's the basic situation. Current NLRB rulings *require* Yale to meet the union half-way. Yale certainly has the right to appeal that ruling, as it has. But to stall until the NLRB considers the appeal? To stall, knowing that a Trump-appointed NLRB is likely to rule in Yale's favor?

Yeah, so much for Hungerford's *misguided* (if not actually disingenuous) presumption of good faith or goodwill on both sides.

I agree that the hunger strike is, shall we say, an extreme measure. I think there were other options that should have been pursued. But a lot of Hungerford's argument rests on the notion that this is academe, this is academic space, and disagreements should be engaged by all parties in good will, in good faith, and reasoned/argued out.

Fantastic. I'm all for that. But that's precisely what Yale admin has chosen not to do. Do recall that Yale made multiple appeals in hopes of the NLRB ruling in their favor. Yale lost all of them. So, again, where is the ""good faith"" or ""good will"" in Yale openly choosing to defy the law set down by the NLRB?

What's so galling about this and Salovey's mealy-mouthed email of a few days ago is this incessant insistence on ""politeness."" At what point does civility and politeness become merely a tool of repression that allows *one* party to unilaterally choose not to engage in reasoned discussion and then, when the other party chooses radical measures, cry about the nobility and supposed pretensions of academic discourse? This happened during the Christakis fiasco as well. And literally the one person who, prominently, made the right call was Jonathan Holloway.

And now he's gone, leaving Yale to the Hungerfords and the Gendlers and the Saloveys.

EDIT: Looks like a fair number of the Law School faculty decided to literally lay down the law upon Salovey. http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2017/05/12/letter-05-12/",15,,1494605490.0,dhg1i0e,False,False,1494547777.0,2017-05-11 19:09:37

I'm not, I'm more curious about the mendacity of the ""alternative press"" and the gullibility of its readers. Just as I am the mainstream media.

The Mars Society's University Rover Challenge Documentary featuring Yale Robotics,cmcgean45,"Each year, student engineering teams from around the world immerse themselves in designing, building, and testing the next generation of Mars Rovers. Then, they pack it up and head off to the annual University Rover Challenge competition at the Mars Desert Research Station in Hanksville, Utah, United States. In this grueling Mars-like environment, they test their rover and themselves in a series of events such as traversing, remote scientific analysis, and retrieval and manipulation. Now in its 10th year, this challenging ordeal has proved to be extremely rewarding for the students as individuals, but also benefits the entire field of space exploration by stimulating innovation and inspiring the next generation of talent who will take us forward.

This documentary video was produced as a way to raise awareness of this entry point for space exploration, for students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) education, and to showcase the experience these university students receive, as they create technology that may one day work alongside human explorers in the field.

Course Selection,jeopardyman,"Some scattered advice: 

&nbsp;

1) Email your residential college dean (if you don't know who that is, just google ""silliman residential college dean"" for example). They will be a primary point person for your whole academic career at Yale and can also direct you to other people with more specialized knowledge of what you want to study. 

&nbsp;

2) If you want to go the business route, I would do some thinking about your majors. Not that there's anything wrong with what you're doing of course. Econ and global are both great majors and definitely set you up for the consulting world if that's something you're into. And while people from both majors (plenty from Econ) go into investment banking, private equity etc., those fields value hard math more than you might expect. Anectdotal, but the two people I know who had the most success in the job interview cycle majored in applied math. There's no one way to get where you're going, but just check out applied math and statistics and data science (s&ds has a certificate option, our version of a minor), because those will be very helpful. Also, strongly recommend a double major, maybe not if you do global because its major requirements are very intense. 

&nbsp;


**HERE IS SOME NITTY GRITTY about requirements and such** 

&nbsp;

Reflecting on my first year, I'd only implore you to do a few things. One, bear in mind your distributional requirements. If you've not gotten the rundown on what those are, here's the gag. In the name of a well-rounded liberal arts education, Yale has three skills and three areas in which you need to take a certain number of courses to gradudate, regardless of your major. The three skills that a course can be labeled with: Quantitative Reasoning (QR), Writing (WR), and Language (L). You have to have at least one class in two different categories by the end of first year. (one QR and one WR, or one WR and one L, for example). By the end of second year, you have to have taken at least one course in all three categories. (at least one QR, one WR, and one L). You could theoretically knock out the sophomore requirement by the end of freshman year. Someone on your track will complete QR without actively trying to, so either start a language this year or look out for WR classes. Also note that any given course doesn't have to be labeled with any of the three skills. Also, also: Do you know what course table is? Reply to this comment if not and I'll explain it, but if you do know, then I don't want to write a long paragraph explaining it (although I totally don't mind to!)

&nbsp;

There's also the three area requirements, which pertain to classes with the labels: Social Science (So), Humanities (Hu), and Science (Sc). There is no requirement to make progress on your area requirements during your first year (although again, you may very well do so accidentally if you take any philosophy, poli sci, anthropology classes). The one area that might be hard to accidentally take is science. The formal requirement is one course in each of the three areas by the end of sophomore year. If you're a humanities person like myself, finding an enjoyable and reasonably easy and low-commitment science class isn't impossible, but it isn't easy. Sounds like you struck out with first-year seminars for the fall, the good news is that gets you priority for first-year seminars in the spring. If I could do it again, I would choose a first-year seminar that satisfies the science requirement, because those classes are geared toward first-years, skew a little easier than the average Yale class, and the small class size means valuable interaction with your peers (maye less so this year) and with truly world-class professors. It isn't ""Yale lite"" at all, there have been first year seminars taught by Nobel prize winners. 

&nbsp;

Small point. Start math this year, preferably this fall. I'm begging you, if you have any ambition to do anything higher than Calc 2 (which you will if you go the s&ds route), it will help you greatly to start math this fall. I'm paying the price right now for not doing that. 

&nbsp;

Also, despite the urgency with which I've made a lot of these claims, Yale's academic requirements and major requirements are structured to tolerate some missteps your first year. So no matter what you do, it's not make-or-break, it won't destroy your chances of accomplishing what you want. I'd say, in general, have some faith that everything will turn out fine. 

&nbsp;

Anyway, this was probably more wall-of-text than you were expecting, but Lord knows I would have needed this comment in your position. Good luck!",3,,False,g0w8939,False,False,1596983805.0,2020-08-09 09:36:45

Also, networking.

What do grad students think about the undergrads at Yale?,BathingMachine,"I see a lot of them feeling guilty for the amount of privilege they've had (and as mentioned, grad students tend to come from less privileged backgrounds) so they start feeling bad on behalf of marginalized groups they have nothing to do with.

We grad students often live in/near the rougher parts of NH, and when I complained about some ratchet behavior (as someone from my trailer-park background is inclined to do) an undergrad tried to call me on my privilege and said I should respect people in poverty. SIS YOU MEAN MY FAMILY? Meanwhile, another one was just stupefied that I had never been to Europe. That tends to irk me, that undergrads assume everyone has lived the life they have. And I know, I know there's a lot of undergrads who aren't like that and aren't wealthy.

My friends who TA say the students are really dedicated, mostly really smart, kind of annoying when it comes to feeling entitled to every little point on every little assignment. It can feel like the student is trying to argue that they know better than the TA/prof, but yes we do occasionally make mistakes (but not THAT many mistakes). I don't personally interact much with undergrads. I work in a lab. I see them occasionally and they talk about how drunk they got. They see themselves as wild but they're mostly all pretty tame af.

Someone posted that Quora article, and I think this part hits the nail on the fucking head:""Unlike undergraduates, most grad students live off campus. There is a grad student dorm in the main grad student compound, but it’s kinda shoddy, and it doesn’t have near the amount of space to supply the demand that exists for graduate housing. New Haven is unsafe. There are tense town-gown relationships, and students are frequently targeted by violence, harassment, and muggings. I personally know a grad student who was beaten up while walking home at 8:30PM. Muggings are common close to campus or on campus, and the fact that grad students nearly all live off campus due to inadequate facillities, places them at greater risk of violence. Grad students also are largely from a less privileged background than the undergrad population, yet they bear the brunt of the negativity directed at the student body and the school.""",9,,1559829104.0,eq2vuq7,False,False,1559744980.0,2019-06-05 09:29:40

Can a College Dropout get into Yale?,MikeVladimirov,"I wouldn't say that Yale is bad at all. I just think that, if you're interested in specifically learning the craft of photography, SVA, NYU, RSID, Parsons, Cooper Union, and Columbia (to an extent) will give far stronger undergraduate educations, assuming you're interested in the East Coast. If you're looking to get any strong networking out of your undergrad, then NYC should be the only location to consider for photography in this part of the country. This is coming as someone who heavily considered several of the above programs for photography about 10 years ago, but chose engineering school instead.

I will admit that dozens is an exaggeration.

I've personally found that higher education is most effective when you have a mentor. It's much easier to find a mentor if you seek one out well in advance of matriculation. When I say emailing profs, I mostly mean requesting a quick phone conversation or requesting to come in for a 15 min chat, if you're local. The combination of an email exchange and a little conversation will tell you a lot about what you can or can't expect from a person. Frankly, if a professor isn't willing to dedicate a few minutes to speaking to someone who admires them after taking the initiative to find them, then they probably won't really care enough to mentor them in the context of a degree program. At least such is my anecdotal experience. A professor *not* making time to speak to a prospective student is as big of a favor to the prospective student as if the professor did take the time; both are quite insightful.

Personally, I found my current masters adviser this way. My girlfriend found her PhD adviser this way...her whole cohort found their advisers this way.

Maybe if you're pursuing a terminal, non-project/research based, pre-doctoral degree, then having a mentor doesn't matter. But a photography degree is always going to be a project based program.

I realize that OP is discussing undergrad studies, and I'm mostly bringing up graduate level examples. But his/her situation with dropping out will be easier for admissions committees to overlook if a professor will potentially vouch for them. Hence my advice.

Hopefully this doesn't come across as too, too harsh. I just wanted to elaborate on where some of my thoughts came from.",1,,False,egx7ubk,False,False,1550712608.0,2019-02-20 19:30:08
Can a College Dropout get into Yale?,western_backstroke,"Yeah, I was under the assumption that op was talking about an mfa program since he/she mention Yale school of art. Which is a grad school. The undergrad art students are at Yale college.

I don't know much at all about undergrad art education.  It used to be that prospective undergrads could submit a portfolio to Yale, and school of art faculty would review it and make recommendations to the admissions commitee. Dunno if that still happens. Regardless, a liberal arts university is probably not the best place to learn any sort of craftsmanship, with just a few exceptions. I don't think Yale is one of those exceptions. However, regarding networking, Yale is *excellent.* Most of the art faculty commute from NYC and it's easy to take the train to the city for openings. I know many folks from Yale who got plugged right into the NY art scene after graduation through faculty or other connections. That may compensate for the poorer quality of undergrad art education compared to someplace like risd.

Some graduate programs do require you to hook up with an adviser in the process of applying and getting accepted. That differs by field and especially according to the funding situation. In other programs you don't choose an advisor until you've been around for a year or two. Imo the latter arrangement is much preferable, but that's just in my experience. Maybe it's worth mentioning that most mfa programs, as far as I know, do not have official mentors or advisers for students.

But honestly, there's absolutely no reason why a professor would be obliged to get back to a prospective student. Fuck I've had advisers who wouldn't even respond to my emails, let alone a stranger's. And there's absolutely no reason why a faculty member could offer good advice even if he or she wanted to. Faculty often just aren't in touch with the academic culture of their own departments, unless they happen to be on advisory committees that give them that exposure. And they're almost never familiar with programs at other schools... So they're actually not particularly qualified to give good advice. Which goes back to my previous comment. That current students and recent grads are the best sources for good information. A lot of em will even have friends at other programs, and can comment directly on differences.

If the goal of contacting faculty is to improve your chances of admission, then that's a different matter entirely. And again, I'm not really a fan of doing that. Unless you know your shit is rock solid, it's very easy to say the wrong thing and make a bad impression. Which is worse than no impression at all.  And of course you need to know exactly who has influence over admissions, which isn't always easy to suss out. My feeling is, spend that time on putting together a great application, write an awesome personal statement, and get solid letters of recommendation. The exception, of course, is situations where you need to find an adviser prior to acceptance.

Is English 115 a good course to improve writing?,writingatYale,"Hi there, 

I'm one of the spring 2019 ENGL 115 instructors. There's some level of variation between 114/115 (114 is supposed to be more non-fiction/big topics, whereas 115 is literary as you say), but in effect they should teach you the framework of making a good argument that translates to several disciplines. For example, I often use the same writing textbook when I teach 114/115 because some features of what makes a strong thesis/claim are interdisciplinary. 

My advice is to speak to the instructor and ask how they view the course; some instructors may treat it as more a literature class than a writing class, whereas others (like myself) view it primarily as a writing class. You can often see this mapped out on the syllabus on Course Search--i.e. what is the first objective? My other piece of advice is to have a modicum of interest in the topic, but even if it's not your first choice, go to the class and see if the instructor is also excited by the topic/excited to be in the room. An enthusiastic instructor who is invested in meeting with and talking to students can make even what appears to be a dull topic exciting. 

Finally, 115 in the spring semester is often an under-enrolled course. This means you may well end up with 5 or 6 people in a section, which is great for students. Ideally you'll get more attention in class and in feedback from your instructor since s/he won't be grading nearly as many students as in the fall semester or in a 114 class. 

Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions or if you want to share which 115 it is--I might be able to speak to your concerns more directly if it's my 115 section. 

Good luck in the new semester!",9,,False,ecvodht,False,False,1546186636.0,2018-12-30 10:17:16

I enjoy literature a lot more than nonfiction when it comes to English classes, and in terms of preparation, I got a 5 on the AP Lit exam, but I’m not sure if that means anything. I’m worried that college English will be a total step up from my high school classes — do you think 115 would be totally fine to take, or is it better to take 114 for starters? Or should I shop around in different sections of both classes?",1,,False,ecx7o1r,False,False,1546228985.0,2018-12-30 22:03:05
Is English 115 a good course to improve writing?,writingatYale,"I think one of the biggest positives for 115, especially in the spring, is the class size, which usually float around 5-10 people instead of the normal 13-14 I have when I teach 114. It means I can spend more time individually with you--although on the other hand it means that you have to be more prepared for in-class discussion and have read everything or it will show. 

We have a bit of leeway when we design our 114/115 classes, which means they all have similar assignments and trajectories, but people do emphasize different skills. That being said, 114 and 115 both emphasize the basics of argumentation and what makes a supportable claim. In my and many other sections you'll get probably 80-90% of the same skillset as 114 with the remainder being more focused on the available tools for reading literature. I would say that a 5 on the AP sets you up nicely for the course! It means you have a good foundation to start from, though part of 115 is unlearning some of the skills AP teaches you (the 5 paragraph/timed essay being one of them). 

Also, getting to teach 115 is competitive as everyone wants to get to teach literature (we're thrilled when our 115 proposals get accepted!); most of the instructors for that course in particular are very excited to be there, which can often translate into enthusiastic teaching. Definitely try on some of the different sections during the shopping period to see what's the best fit for you, but I think 115 is a good fit for someone who's excited about literature even if that's not their major.

As for not having a lot of exposure to the humanities, don’t worry about that at all - it’s Yale, so there’s going to be some people who have already taken Latin/Ancient Greek/studied Plato in depth or whatever, but the vast majority of DSers don’t have much experience with the works at all. The workload is heavy, but that’s the nature of the program - lots of reading, but no one really does 100% of it, mainly just as much as they can without burning out (you figure out what you can and can’t get away with not reading throughout the program). Your writing skills will definitely improve and you’ll probably end up being able to write a lot faster/more efficiently simply because you’re cranking out a 5-page essay every week (be prepared to sacrifice your Thursdays). There’s definitely a sense of community, and it’s often easy to make friends with other DS kids because you know the struggle and, likely, have shared interests in the classics. I’d say if you’re interested in the material, do it! It’s been immensely rewarding, especially because, like you said, the seminar-style discussions are invaluable (as well as a rare opportunity for a first-year to be able to take so many seminars). The professors are also top-notch and you end up really close with them if you make an effort. As it’s 3 out of your 4 classes, however, it is a big schedule commitment - but you can always drop it after first semester if you want, a lot of people do that if they find it’s too much/not to their taste.

Any veterans currently or have done Eli Whitney program?,Friendly_Sociopath,"The GI Bill is definitely useful and almost necessary. New Haven, surprisingly, is an expensive city. You'll want the BAH and textbook allowance. Also, Yale is one of the most expensive institutions on the planet. I had a ton of scholarships, grants, etc... and I still owed the school money once I left. Not that much, but enough to stress about. 

Going from active duty to Yale was a GREAT experience. I got out in 2010 and went to a community college. I transferred to Yale in 2011 through the Eli Whitney program and it was definitely life changing. You will have frustrating and stressful days, as with any challenge... but it'll all be worth it in the end. 

When I attended Yale, we didn't have access to 100% of what the traditional undergrads received, but we came pretty close. We had to pay for our meals on campus, undergrads had meal plans. We couldn't live on the residential campuses because we were too old (and you don't want to live with a bunch of 18-year olds anyway) and our personal relationships with our deans and masters was a bit lackluster given our non-traditional status. Aside from that, everything else is pretty normal. I joined a fraternity, which was... interesting. I did it for networking opportunities, but given my age, the difference in age, and the different life paths... i just had fun partying. 

I was full time student the entire time, yes, and I started managing a restaurant off-campus to make ends meet. 

Just a heads up... the Eli Whitney program doesn't typically accept applicants straight out of the military. You normally have to complete a year or two at a separate institution and then transfer in. ",1,,False,e5fijce,False,False,1536150946.0,2018-09-05 07:35:46

My wife works at Yale so I switched to employee insurance (free), which shifted me into Magellan territory.

I got much more out of Magellan than I got out of Mental Health, and finding the right physician made all of the difference.  ",7,,False,e1buniy,False,False,1530032641.0,2018-06-26 12:04:01
Mental health -access to psychiatrists,justanotheryalie,"It really does depend on the nature of your illness, as well as the present severity. 

Whilst at Yale, I had a bipolar I diagnosis, as well as a few other things that aren't usually considered as critical in the mental health sphere (anxiety, alcohol abuse, etc). I know that they try to get students who are currently on medication in quickly, but I'm not convinced that necessarily follows on for subsequent visits. 

I was diagnosed while at Yale, and I had to wait a few days at most to see a psychiatrist. 

I was very, very unwell for a period and was hospitalized frequently. During this period, I saw either my psychiatrist or therapist every day (or we would have a short phone session). 

I found at Yale, the mental health department effectively had two groups of students: students who are acutely and actively suicidal or psychotic, and those that aren't. The latter group is substantially larger and many of these students do have serious, diagnosed conditions and suicidal thoughts, but aren't in imminent danger. The wait time for the first group is very low, whereas students in the second group wait months. As an example, a friend who had been admitted to hospital for situational depression in high school spent three months in line to get an appointment for bulimia. 

If you have bipolar I, schizophrenia or a history of multiple suicide attempts with current ideation, I don't think you would wait long. ",2,,False,e1cg1j0,False,False,1530050715.0,2018-06-26 17:05:15

Last year things got bad enough that I was unable to function for 2x1.5 months of the year, something which I do not think is sustainable had I not been finished my degree. However, I'm not a danger to myself these days and it sounds like they might not consider something like that emergent enough to be seen frequently. 

I guess the bottomline is: Do you feel that the mental health treatment offered at Yale is so slow that people with highly detrimental but not life-threatening illnesses end up dropping out?

The current issues have meant that I've had to meet with my psychiatrist regularly and tweak medications frequently, and it is only with a lot of tweaking that we've made any progress. I don't really see that happening fast enough at Yale if an appointment is once every three months.

Mental health -access to psychiatrists,justanotheryalie,"""Do I think the mental health treatment offered at Yale is so slow that people with highly detrimental but not life-threatening illnesses end up dropping out? ""

It depends on what you mean about dropping out. Dropping out of the university? Probably not, because deans can escalate concerns to the mental health department and get students into treatment (though often by this stage, some of the damage is done). Drop out of treatment because they can't get an appointment (or enough appointments)? Absolutely.

The mental health department at Yale has basically turned into liability management. Will this student kill themselves or others? If so, treat them ASAP. Otherwise, you're not that important. As I said, a friend with bulimia with past hospitalization waited three months. I know of sexual assault survivors (on Yale's campus) with debilitating PTSD who couldn't get seen. Part of the problem is that if you do wait long enough, you will get seen, but that means that people upset about a breakup or stressed about assignments take slots from students who have legitimate illnesses.

My strategy would be to book an intake appointment as soon as your student health insurance goes live, and to stress you need to continue medication management. I would also take as much medication as you can legally with you (this depends on where you live but where I'm from you can get a special code for the government to let you take additional restricted medication).  

I think general medication management if you're not unwell enough is every 2-6 weeks and it is very difficult to bring forward appointments. I tweaked my medications significantly as an outpatient at Yale. However, I was either visibly manic/psychotic or severely depressed (unable to read, roll over in bed, actively suicidal). If you enter crisis they will work really closely with you, but they don't even have the office space to accommodate clinicians for the number of students who seek them out. 

I will say though, unless you are a risk, there is only so hard they can work with you. If you need intense therapy, you can do an IOP through Yale-New Haven (long waiting list unless you've been recently admitted though). Yale does push taking semesters off a lot. I feel like they would be more likely to do that than to work intensively with most students, because there are just too many students at Yale who want treatment.

Mental health -access to psychiatrists,justanotheryalie,"What sort of program are you in, if I can ask? Is it something which is coursework based or is it going to have a major research component (i.e. PhD)? 

I ask because the line mental health takes is usually that if you're too impaired to function, you're too impaired to study, so you should opt to take time off if that happens. However, if you're doing something coursework based, there are drop deadlines. When I was there, I think you needed to drop out in the first few weeks. If you didn't, you had to go through medical leave, but it wasn't guaranteed you could come back if you did that. If things are still like that, figure out when the drop deadline is, and if an episode is brewing, take time off. Things are much more flexible in a research program. 

If you're doing coursework, another thing to keep in mind is that if an episode sets in around the end of semester, you can take an incomplete, meaning that you have a massive extension to finish the semester and hand in your work (I was given nine months). This is a good option if you don't think you're well enough to do assessments, but you've well and truly missed the drop deadline. 

At least for Yale College, there was also the option of taking a reduced courseload in the wake of an episode. You did need to get forms signed, but I've never heard of there being an issue for students who are legitimately unwell. ",3,,False,e1cxtm4,False,False,1530069440.0,2018-06-26 22:17:20

If you want more affordable options, Mamouns, House of Naan, Sushi on Chapel, Mecha, Basil, Pad Thai, Jeera Thai, Prime 16, Rubamba, and BAR are all great. 

If you’re looking for famous New Haven pizza, check out Pepe’s, Sally’s, or Modern, although those aren’t as close (still in New Haven though).

You should definitely try to take classes that you find interesting, but also won't be too challenging. Freshman seminars are a great place to start! And look at CourseTable! Learning how to live at college is at least another class. You have plenty of time to take Extreme Advanced Accelerated Theory of [your major].

Yale Student Profile Wanted: We want to know your thoughts on Yale University!,finolex1,"Hey! Yale student here (xPosting from r/ApplyingToCollege). Here are some of the things I love best about Yale:

* Arts Scene: Yale is the only major research university to have a top ranked Music School, Drama School, Architecture School and Arts School in one place. This means the range of talents on campus and events that happen everyday is almost unparalleled. For instance, see this: http://artscalendar.yale.edu/ (It's the summer holidays this month and there's still about 10-15 major events happening across campus each day). Yale undergrads as a whole are also extremely interested in the arts, which is why we have about 10+ acapella groups (including one that takes a year off to sing around the world), dozens of theater companies, comedy troupes, literary societies etc.

* Range of academic interests: Unlike several of our peer schools where Econ and CS are currently kings, I daresay Yale students as an aggregate have a far more evenly spread out range of intellectual interests. For example, the top major here is History - almost delightfully quaint and old-fangled. My friends include CS&Music, CS&Linguistics, Physics&Philosophy and Econ&Math double majors, among others. The academic structure of the college means its almost trivially easy to take courses in a wide range of fields, switch between majors (including engineering ones), and double major.

* Research Opportunities: There's a ton of fellowships and research opportunities for anyone hoping to be closely involved in research. https://admissions.yale.edu/undergraduate-research: 95% of science students are involved in some form of research, and from anecdotal experience this isn't limited to working in the labs; I've seen people do fieldwork abroad, work in the Peabody Natural History Museum, work on Art reconstruction, etc.",4,,False,diypawv,False,False,1497572392.0,2017-06-15 19:19:52
Missed the whole Master/Head revision. Was it a controversy?,orangeazn,"I'll try to paint a neutral picture of how these events/changes unfolded. As many people may know, there were 2 main catalysts that occurred around Halloween 2015. One was the Christakis email controversy about costumes, and the second was a claim that a frat refused to let a girl in because she was black. 

After these events, there were various demonstrations and meetings held designed to display outrage and encourage conversation. It was at this time that people vocalized problems including Calhoun and ""master."" The African American cultural house (afam) then had a meeting (i believe also including other minority groups) where they listed about 10 or so changes they wanted to be made by the administration. A few months later they basically accepted about half of the changes, including the change from master to head of college. Then early in the 2016-17 school year, they changed Calhoun to grace hopper college. 

Now the question about controversy (I'm gonna stop being neutral). Of course there were dissenting opinions, but essentially what happened was that the 2015-16 school  year became a massive social justice pep rally (not only at yale but across the country). Within a large, outspoken liberal community, social justice was the only option someone could have. Every other view was silenced, especially on social media. Imo, it was as bad if not worse than the reddit echo chamber.  As an Asian American (middle class, parents were immigrants), I've never felt more oppressed than that year. 
So to answer your question, yes there was controversy, but there was no debate. The largest (read only) voice against the master and Calhoun changes were alumni. 

To be clear, I'm not completely against these changes. The best argument I heard was that these changes don't really affect me that much, but they can make the lives of others much better, so why not. However, what I am very much against is the lack of conversation allowed. The entire point of the Christakis email was to encourage conversation about Halloween costumes, yet it was completely drowned out as being insensitive. 

I also do think it's funny that in the midst of all this, one of the 2 new colleges was named Ben Franklin College.  ",9,,False,dhv5d9v,False,False,1495409320.0,2017-05-21 18:28:40
Missed the whole Master/Head revision. Was it a controversy?,airbornemint,"The word ""master"", as you are surely aware, has complex history in US english. It references the British school system (as in head master); it references other wester higher education (as in Master's degree); it references slavery; and that's not even the end of it.

Nobody that is having this conversation is in any disagreement that the word ""master"" entered modern US english through multiple pathways and that some of those pathways — unlikely slavery — are not heinous.

However, what is debated is what to do with the fact that the word ""master"" *has* been used in a particularly heinous context (slavery). 

There are roughly two approaches people take here. Either you say ""the word 'master' doesn't mean anything heinous to me, and therefore I think we should keep using it regardless of how deeply uncomfortable it is to some"" or you say ""the word master, even though it doesn't mean anything troubling to some people, has been used in a context that is heinous to many other people, and therefore we could show kindness to them by replacing the word with something less heinous"".

What I suggest you do here is not consider what you think of the word ""master"" or its replacements. You clearly do not have the cultural context in which that word is heinous, and therefore making an argument about what the word means to you (which isn't much) is not the point.

Instead, try to think of a word that *would* mean something to you. Can you think of any word that, when you use it, stirs deep pain, shame, or unease? If you can, then maybe it would be worth considering what it would feel like if you were forced to use that word (perhaps by virtue of it being a part of someone's title).

Not everyone can come up with such a word. This is partly because few social structures have been as deeply hurtful and oppressive as racism in the US — many people in the US not only do not have direct experience with being on the receiving end of racism, but they also have no comparable experience of their own. 

In other words: when people are debating whether ""master"" should be retained as a title, what they are telling you is that hearing the word ""master"" (and being required to call someone ""master"") is a deeply uncomfortable experience for some. That it isn't a deeply uncomfortable experience for you is beside the point; the question that matters is whether you are willing to trust that it's a painful experience for some, and what you are willing to do to make it less so. It is understandably difficult, but nonetheless worthwhile, to put work into trying to relate to their experience — especially if you have no comparable experience in your own life — before arguing about what should be done.",10,,False,dhu6ujl,False,False,1495348476.0,2017-05-21 01:34:36

Some people were uncomfortable with calling the head/master of a college ""Master."" Most people didn't really care, because they didn't have a connection with master as a negative term.

Questions about Yale,orangeazn,"1. I usually did not have any problem with the food, but people generally complain about the food at every school. The main thing about yale is that it tries to push towards healthier/more inclusive foods which tend to mean a good number of vegan/vegetarian options. At the same time, there are many constants that are great to look forward to (i.e. chicken tenders thursdays). 

2. Residential college system is different for each person, depending on how much you want to take advantage of it. I basically did the minimum, but it was still a great way to meet new people at the start of the year. The school does try to push it a little, giving you  big brothers/sisters, and your master (now head of college) and Dean will make college specific events which are pretty fun. There is some variation in quality of deans and masters but they will know your name by the time you get to school and do a lot to help to make sure you're having a good college experience. 

 I would say most ppl who don't do a varsity sport or a big club (a capella etc.)will generally have their best friend group in their college, but others will still be closer to their classmates in their majors. 

3. CS at yale is actually very strong despite yale not having a large reputation for it. Engineering on the other hand, you would have a better time (easier job search) going to a good tech school though, though I'm not too familiar with either.

Questions about Yale,Pandaemonium,"1) My first year I *loved* the food, second year thought it was fine, by the third year it made me slightly queasy... I think the quality was good all three years but you can end up getting sick of eating more-or-less the same things.

2) I personally think the residential college system is one of the highlights of Yale. It really becomes a close-knit community, which really gives you a great foundation for your campus life. You don't need to try to make friends, it just happens because you all live together and (importantly) eat meals together. I'm still really good friends with a lot of people from my college. Heck, two of my best friends actually got married in the courtyard of our college because it was so meaningful to them, and I was their best man.

3) I think the CS program is excellent. I know people who are now working at Google or faculty at MIT who did CS at Yale. There was a bit of recent hubbub about the faculty being understaffed, but I believe they're hiring more.",5,,False,dg1kema,False,False,1491765674.0,2017-04-09 14:21:14

Questions about Yale,ctete,"1. Food is great. Until you eat so much your first year and you realize you've gained like 20 pounds and need to stop getting seconds and thirds. Also, it depends on the residential college.

We actually had a bit of an off-campus college system going on with others who did not feel like they fit into their residential college much.

If you have a few different things you're passionate about (music, athletics, politics, etc) you'll be as good an applicant as anyone. There's no one thing that Yale wants to see. Frankly though, if it comes off as though you just added a bunch of extracurriculars in anticipation of applying to college, you won't be admitted. After a certain point, your level of engagement in your interests matters more than how many activities you do; there are diminishing returns on having a schedule packed with things that you care equally little about. Find things you're already passionate about and figure out how to really live them more fully (because that's what Yale wants from its students and alumni!).",2,,False,dg184h9,False,False,1491748177.0,2017-04-09 09:29:37

Questions about Yale,ctete,"Honestly, one of the best times of my life. A lot of ups and downs but ultimately it was magical. The residential college dean also provides you with so much support. He pretty much saved my life (saying this only kind of hyperbolically). My senior year I was in a real state of depression and called mental health but the next appointment would be in like three weeks so I gave up on that. Went to my dean and told him I may want to take the rest of the semester off. He insisted on walking me to the emergency mental health clinic even though I kept refusing until he was like, ""it would make me feel a lot better."" And I was like fuck okay. So he brought me there, waited with me then waited for me. And I ultimately got the help I needed because he was so insistent.

Admissions Interview,conlion,"I've done several interviews for prospective Yale students (as in I'm the one interviewing) so I can share a little of what I like to ask. Prepare to be asked about your background, academic interests, what you like to do outside of school, why Yale, and any questions you may have about college. I usually ask a lot of follow up about interests to see if you're passionate about something (it really can be anything) and see how much you can tell me about any one subject. 

Our forms are free form, so I usually write a couple paragraphs of impressions of the interviewee and what did/didn't impress me about the person. I'm also a pretty casual interviewer, so I prefer a conversation over a question/answer format but you might not have that experience -- it depends on the person.

I just got in - What are some great things about Yale that you did not realize until you began your studies?,,"Kudos, dude.

Calhoun has they best [buttery](http://calhoun.yalecollege.yale.edu/trolley-stop) of all 12 residential colleges—'nuff said. (It's also the most centrally located.)

Yale is unabashedly itself. I think it attracts a quirky sort of person, and Yale has never seemed embarrassed to showcase that quirkiness. No one ""culture"" dominates the campus (though it reputedly has a more artsy vibe than its peer institutions) and I really like the way students rally behind conventionally ""uncool"" things, like the [juggling club](http://www.yaleantigravity.org/) or the [marching band](http://www.yale.edu/yaleband/ypmb/). I've heard from friends at similar places (Princeton, Harvard, etc) that the high school mentality still reigns supreme...whereas Yalies seem to respect eccentric passions not in spite of their weirdness, but *because* of their weirdness. (Eating clubs and final clubs also exert a much bigger social chokehold on Princeton and Harvard respectively than secret societies do at Yale—but that's another story for another day.)

Yale is firmly undergraduate-focused, but the graduate resources are available in the background (I'm a sophomore taking a class at the law school). That's a kind of balance you won't find at schools of Yale's ilk. I also think the Yale student body is particularly well-rounded, more so than ""cerebral"" schools like UChicago.

Yeah, so that, in a nutshell, is why I think Yale is a singularly awesome place. I'd be happy to talk about more specifics (like the unique [Directed Studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_Studies_at_Yale_University) program) if you want.

As for surprise, I was taken aback by the nocturnal nature of college life. I would've never dreamed during high school that I'd be staying up regularly 'til 3 or 4am. Something about Yale dance parties also awakened a hitherto dormant dance beast within me. Who knew I could bust moves with such zeal?",3,,1355710267.0,c7hps3j,False,False,1355709824.0,2012-12-16 20:03:44
I just got in - What are some great things about Yale that you did not realize until you began your studies?,Saybrugian,"Congratulations!

Saybrook is the best residential college.

As soon as I got to Yale, I was surprised by the community the residential colleges provided. There were a bunch of people (both other freshmen and upperclassmen) that I had something in common with. It was a little like meeting extended family for the first time: we didn't know each other at all but there was some kind of link.

Silly things I also noticed quickly were how quickly the hot water was available and how it never ran out, even if I took forever in the shower. 

One thing I wanted from Yale was to be able to do research. I knew there were some good programs to get into it, but I didn't realize actually how easy it would be. Stars paid for room and board over the summer and paid a stipend.

I don't believe these concessions come at the expense of graduate students—an institution with Yale's wealth and resources can afford to pamper its undergraduates without diverting care and attention from its graduate students. My original comment was more a statement about student culture than educational emphasis: as the most vocal and visible cohort (and the numerical preponderance), undergraduates have the largest presence on campus.

Seriously ask yourself why you want to do this. You say its financial-- I'm assuming this means you're somehow paying for your own degree and that Yale fin aid isn't going to help.

Thus, you should probably care what your degree is in, and have career plans, plan for internships/etc. You mention wanting to do an ""easy major""; 1. this does not exist 2. you would need to have started it already last year esp if you plan to finish in three years 3. you do actually have to work after you get your degree in something related.

Fastest way to get credits? How do I graduate early?,pdxpittie,"I graduated a few years ago, and back then the acceleration policy with APs was that 5s in certain subjects would let you “skip” intro courses or prereqs, but they would NOT count for any credit. 

Due to health reasons, I had to drop a few classes during my 8 semesters at Yale. I was only able to graduate on time thanks to YSS credits and a transfer credit after taking a class at an in-state university close to home during a different summer. The latter required pre-approval from my dean, a departmental review of the syllabus, then an A grade. The course grade did not count towards my GPA but was accepted as a transfer credit. I believe transfer credits like this were capped at 2 max. 

If you hope to get 26.5 credits in four semesters, you’re most likely out of luck. Highly unlikely you would get approved for 6.5+ credits each semesters. The only people I know who ever got approved for 6+ credits were the academic super stars who graduated with 40+ credits, often studied multiple languages, and won the highest gpa prizes at graduation.

If you do History, English, or something similar, it would be a bit easier. 

Concerning credits and acceleration, research for credit is a thing but I have only seen it during the school year as a replacement for a class. There are plenty of easy classes that can be taken, whether or not they fulfill your schedule and credit requirements is a different question. Filter coursetable by workload to find them.

Not to dox myself, but you actually can't at Yale.

You sign a contract that you will remain on campus for 8 semesters, no more, no less.

Yale is spending $135 million on one diversity initiative. How much is it spending university-wide? | The College Fix,DryFish037,"What is this article trying to say? Yes, on the surface, Yale is throwing $135 million towards ONE diversity initiative named FEDI (Faculty Excellence & Diversity Initiative). But, as most grant funded programs operate, there are many facets and teams involved with the grant, from central administrative to evaluation operations. Just because this reporter couldn't get a detailed response of how this entire system operates from a busy faculty member doesn't mean he can make a conclusive opinion about it. 

&#x200B;

>*The College Fix* reached out to multiple faculty members listed under the school’s [**Faculty Development & Diversity website**](https://faculty.yale.edu/contacts) to learn just how much money was being put towards diversity at Yale outside of the ongoing faculty initiative.  
>  
>Most did not respond, but those who did claimed ignorance regarding the total amount of diversity spending at the school.

The reporter goes onto a school website and cold-emails a bunch of busy faculty members who have specific roles in this program and asks for professional/private information that 1) they may not know because not everyone knows what every dollar of this pool of funding is applied to 2) they do not feel comfortable sharing with a random stranger 3) any other reason that may be considered by an expert in that field. 

So after cold-emailing ""multiple"" people part of a program that involves tens, maybe hundreds, of faculty member, isn't it a bit harsh to answer the title with ""**Nobody** can apparently say?"" 

I ask the reporter: Reconsider what Gladney wrote in his response. He said ""it's probably better to ask how that money is to be spent as the budget, as the budget may be superfluous to the desired result."" So listen to him and maybe instead of asking ""How *much* is Yale spending university-wide,"" ask ""*How* is Yale spending this $135 million through-out the university?""",10,,False,ff7lhsn,False,False,1579652394.0,2020-01-21 18:19:54

The intro lectures, in my experience, are not great. That being said, I think you should take at least up to macro, since it's generally good to know how the economy works.

\- Seminar and lecture for micro have different problem sets. The lecture will likely have \~200 students and a section, seminar has no section. From what I hear, seminar is harder and not really worth it since you're learning the same material.

\- It's curved usually such that there are 45% A’s, 55% B’s, 5% C-D-F. People who drop the course after the midterm are included in the curve though, so it's usually the case that it's impossible to get a D or F. You have to try to get a C in order to get a C, really.

\- Plenty of office hours, residential college tutoring, peer tutoring, Center for Teaching and Learning tutoring. The classes are so big that your suite mates or froco group will probably take it too, so pset groups are invaluable.

\- Don't bother prepping. Plenty of people go in without exposure to Econ and they do fine. 

\- No! It probably won't be fun, since you're learning a bunch of theory, but it opens up gateways to more exciting Econ classes, so you might as well get it out of the way. It's kind of a quintessential Yale class, too.

Cool stuff about Hopper?,WeHaSaulFan,"Thanks for your response and for asking. I was there for a random day. Met up with the VP of a student group that I was active in during my time at school. Happened to be from the same state as me. (I lived in Connecticut at the time, so it was easy for me to drop by, though not a frequent thing. Had been years, outside of reunions, since I had eaten in a YUDH.) She was not a Hopperite, but because I was, she met me there with a few friends from our group. As an aside, I was struck by how beautiful the room is. So many warm feelings and memories came to the fore for me. But I digress.

We used to always complain about dining hall food as well, seems to be a grand tradition. Even though, at the time, in the Ivy League, we were reputed to have the best food other than Cornell, owing to the fact that it has a school for that.

It’s all a matter of perspective, and I haven’t been to the other schools that you cite, but from what I saw, what you’re getting is light years ahead of what we were.

Stanford CS is the ""obvious"" choice, although someone graduating from Yale has no barriers to a very successful life. 

In no particular order, here are a few possible reasons to choose Yale CS over Stanford:

- Your brother is from California, and would like to try the New England college experience before returning to the Valley.

- He is interested in the arts, and wants a diverse undergrad experience, i.e. not totally dominated by tech/startups 24*7.

- He'd like to get to know NYC and Boston.

- He might be interested in interning in finance or some other non-tech field.

- He'd prefer the feel of a smaller, urban, campus.

- He prefers a department still small enough to know (almost) all his classmates.

- He loves to play squash!

Diversity Theatre at Yale,TreeLover1994,"Strongly agree with this article, been overwhelming annoyed by all the additional focus on this in my grad school curriculum. Here’s the text for those without WSJ accounts:

Yale President Peter Salovey announced a major expansion of the school’s diversity bureaucracy this month, providing a case study in how not to lead a respected institution of higher education.

The pretext for this latest accretion of bureaucratic bloat was a May 2018 incident in a graduate student dorm. Sarah Braasch, a 43-year-old doctoral candidate in philosophy, called campus police at 1:40 a.m. to report someone sleeping in a common room, which she believed was against dorm rules. Yale administrators knew Ms. Braasch had psychological problems and that she had a history of bad blood with the sleeping student, Lolade Siyonbola, a 35-year-old doctoral candidate in African studies. But because Ms. Braasch is white and Ms. Siyonbola is black, the administration chose to turn the incident into a symbol of what Mr. Salovey called the university’s “discrimination and racism.”

Yale leaders immediately announced a slew of new initiatives: “implicit bias” training for graduate students, grad-school staff and campus police; instruction in how to run “inclusive classrooms”; “community building” sessions; a student retreat to develop the next phase of equity and inclusion programming. Despite this flurry of corrective measures, Kimberly M. Goff-Crews, Yale’s secretary and vice president for student life, ominously declared there was still “much more to do.”


That “more” was soon in coming. Yale commissioned an outside diversity bureaucrat—Benjamin Reese, vice president of institutional equity at Duke—to evaluate its diversity infrastructure, which, predictably, he found sorely lacking. Never mind Mr. Reese’s acknowledgment that Yale receives “few” student complaints about what the diversity industry calls “D&H” (discrimination and harassment) or his own claim that diversity training is of “little long-term utility.” What Yale needed, according to Mr. Reese, was even more “expert”-run training “related to race and other aspects of identity and difference.”

Most predictably, Yale accepted Mr. Reese’s recommendations. Yale will create a costly new diversity sinecure: a deputy secretary for diversity, equity, and inclusion. The university will also hire a cadre of diversity “specialists” to teach the Yale community about a “culture of belonging,” in Mr. Salovey’s words.

ADVERTISEMENT

These new positions come on top of Yale’s existing diversity bureaucracy: a deputy provost for faculty diversity and development; the president’s committee on diversity and inclusion; the president’s committee on racial and ethnic harassment; the diversity and inclusion working group; the Yale College Intercultural Affairs Council; the director, representative, and support specialist of equal opportunity programs; the chief diversity officer; the associate dean for graduate-student development and diversity in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the assistant director of diversity in that same school; the associate dean for graduate student development and diversity in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences; the assistant director of diversity and inclusion in the Law School; the director of community and inclusion in the School of Management; the deputy dean for diversity and inclusion in the School of Medicine; the assistant dean of community and inclusion in the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies; the associate vice president for student life (a diversity function); the Student Advisory Group on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; sundry Title IX coordinators; and the directors of the Afro-American Cultural Center, the Asian American Cultural Center, the Latino Cultural Center and the Native American Cultural Center.

In addition to the new hires, the Yale Center for the Study of Race, Indigeneity and Transnational Migration will receive further funding for diversity events and speakers.

What is the evidence of Yale’s “hate and exclusion,” as Mr. Salovey has put it, to justify this ever-growing antibias apparatus? There is none. The Reese report cited a controversy “over a message to students regarding Halloween costumes,” as well as “a reported racist incident at a fraternity party” that never actually happened.

That 2015 Halloween controversy consisted of a two-hour student mob tirade, complete with cursing, directed at Nicholas Christakis, a respected sociologist and physician, after his wife, Erika, who also taught at Yale, suggested that students could choose their costumes without administrative oversight. Four diversity bureaucrats were present for the mobbing of Mr. Christakis but said nothing in his defense. Continuing student harassment eventually forced the Christakises from their positions as masters of a Yale residential college and Ms. Christakis resigned from her teaching position.

ADVERTISEMENT

No administrator ever rebuked the student thugs, and Yale conferred the Nakanishi Prize on two of the instigators. According to the school’s website, the prize is given in recognition of “exemplary leadership in enhancing race and/or ethnic relations at Yale College.”

The Reese report also cited Yale’s initial decision not to rechristen Calhoun College, another residential college, named for Yale alumnus and antebellum slavery defender John C. Calhoun. In that instance, Mr. Salovey quickly caved in to student pressure and reversed himself.

Far from harboring “hate and exclusion,” Yale has spent millions of dollars trying to outbid competing universities for the small number of blacks and Hispanics in the faculty hiring pipeline. In 2015 Mr. Salovey pledged $50 million for faculty diversity, money that has netted more than 60 “diverse” hires. In 2016 the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences disclosed that no “underrepresented minority” professor had lost a tenure bid during the previous five years. Needless to say, this isn’t the case for professors who happen to be white men. While Yale doesn’t reveal the SAT scores of its freshman class by race, it is a virtual certainty that the college extends preferences to black and Hispanic applicants.

By perpetuating a false narrative about its own racism, Yale, like the vast majority of colleges and universities today, encourages its minority students to think of themselves as victims. That mentality is contrary to fact and will hinder those who adopt it from fully seizing the boundless opportunities for learning that Yale and other universities offer to all on an equal basis. The ever-growing diversity bureaucracy at Yale and elsewhere is an invitation for endless student complaint and protest. The ensuing agitation is a boon for bureaucrats. For the rest of us, it augurs a country ever more primed to see bias where none exists and ever more divided by group identity.

Grad Housing,Ziddletwix,"As others have covered the housing logistics (basically, the FB group is often easiest, Craigslist also works, East Rock is the most common area for grad students, but especially with a car you have some flexibility, and downtown would be closer to the med school), I'll chime in on this part 

> Also is it unreasonable to not want a roommate on grad student money?

Well, by ""chime in"", I mean I won't be very helpful and say that ultimately, this sort of question almost entirely comes down to what you value? First, it does depend on your financial situation, but I'll assume that you're in the modal spot with a normal stipend and no notable other financial burden (loans, family, etc. If you are in a different situation, obviously none of us can offer relevant advice).

If you decide that nicer housing (i.e., no roommates, but still spacious and a nice area) is one of the things that is valuable to you, then you can afford it on your basic grad stipend. It just means you'll have less for other things. It's hard to offer advice because even on identical PhD stipends, people have very different habits. I don't have many expenses (I don't eat out a lot, or spend money at bars, or get to take trips very often, and I don't have a car/etc), so I end up saving a decent chunk of my stipend each year, and could easily afford a spacious single if I decided I didn't want to save. But other people have reasonably different lifestyles. I don't mean extravagant, but some decide they don't have time to cook so they just get takeout each day, which ends up being pricey.

So basically the only answer I could give is simply ""It is very possible to live off a PhD stipend in a nice 1BR apt in a nice area"", but that answer can be pretty misleading because just because many *can* reasonably do it, doesn't mean everyone can. I know it's obvious to say ""if you spend more on housing you have less for other things"", but the fact is outside of it being ""doable"", there isn't much more to add. Talking to different PhD students often feels like you're talking to people of entirely different income brackets, even when they are paid the exact same amount. Some people talk about never worrying about money and saving plenty (I'm more in that camp), while others are living the ""broke starving student"" dream, and it really depends on how you handle the rest of your money.",2,,False,ei5uymj,False,False,1552163593.0,2019-03-09 14:33:13

Elitism at Yale,fuzentrix,"Elitism isn't really present here in the sense people talk about the Ivy League schools being full of ""rich kids"" or only legacy admits etc. I think no matter whether you end up choosing Yale or MIT, you'll find elitism in both cases. In MIT's case, it's more of an elitism in championing STEM and the physical sciences over the social sciences, economics, the arts, ... At Yale, any elitism you might encounter might be from the smaller percentage of kids who got in with wealthier families or generations of legacy (you'll definitely find kids from very wealthy families at MIT too, so this isn't really an issue exclusive to Yale or just the Ivy League schools). That being said, it's largely a myth that Yale is full of snobby intellectuals who come from the highest income bracket. My friends range from QuestBridge admits (0 EFC) to middle-class urban students to rural students from the Midwest. It's much more diverse than you might think, and the university strives to provide more than enough resources to lower income students if you believe that might be an issue. My friend received funding from the school to purchase a laptop, winter clothes, and textbooks when she got here since she was one of the lower percentiles of income bracket.

I'd focus more on how you feel when you come to Bulldog Days at Yale and CPW at MIT. If you're considering majoring in Math-Econ, Yale's a great place to do that. My roommate is a Math-Econ major and is taking graduate level courses in the Math and Econ departments because he passed out of all the intro courses due to advanced high school experience, and Wall Street/consulting/finance/investment banking is recruiting here all the time for internships and jobs. If you wish to challenge yourself, there's enough rigor for you to be drowning in problem sets if that's your thing. There's definitely plenty of opportunities to excel in Math-Econ both here and at MIT; the major difference is that at MIT you'll probably be one of few in Math-Econ or Econ though due to the popularity of CS/engineering/physics there, while here it's one of the more popular majors. Just as a reference: http://web.mit.edu/registrar/stats/majors/index.html
You can see that at MIT, there are 11 economics majors and 19 mathematical economics majors in the entire undergraduate class right now. Not that it's a bad thing, but just something to think about when you're visiting both schools and thinking about the type of environment you enjoy more.

 I think either way, you'll end up achieving your dream job of economic analyst for a tech company or Wall Street analyst no matter which school you choose. It's just a question of which environment you'd rather be in for the next four years, a more STEM-oriented one or a more academically diverse one.

There will be opinionated people and people who disagree with you everywhere you go in life and trying to avoid that will only stunt your worldview and ability to work with others in the future.

"Conservative students of Yale, how has your experience been so far?",amonaroll,"Yeah this is my main concern about committing to Yale...I was hoping that people would be very open-minded but when I joined the Yale group chat, someone mentioned a group of Upenn/Harvard Republican students talking about the economy and there was immediate backlash, to quote ""mini-Trumps"", ""GROSSSSS"", ""assholes with superiority complexes"", ""compensating for insecurities"", etc. Maybe it was just the Harvard hate...but it really sickened me that they'd act that way upon mentioning Republicans. 

I also found [this article](https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4410-conservative-at-yale) talking about being conservative at Yale, and it seems like conservative students still receive hostility to some extent.

But, even if the general population is anti-conservative, there are still definitely groups at Yale where you'd fit in (Independent Party, Yale College Republicans, The Federalist Party, etc).

Depends on the view, honestly. If it's a view like ""Gay people should not be able to marry/have kids/live an equal life to me"" then it's not going to be met well. If it's something like, ""I think that a flat tax is a good idea"" -- well, people might question your economic skills, but they won't hate on you for being conservative.

I really don't care on a personal level how you view Yale, in all honesty. I don't know you, and if I ever meet you it will be completely independent of our Reddit conversations. If you really want to understand the culture, then go read some pieces written by *students*, not by media outlets that have an incentive to make you feel a certain way.

But it seems that you came into the thread and did little more than engage in mutual back-patting with the OP about how terrible the Christakis video is and reinforcing your preconceived notion that conservative views are not welcome at Yale. You tried to hold up the loss of (at most a couple of) imaginary internet points as evidence that you're surrounded by people that are against you.

What I can tell you is that Yale is a wonderful place, but that the majority of the notions you have about it now are likely wrong, and I don't mean that in a negative way. Yale really is something that you have to experience. Regarding the Christakis video, I was in Silliman when that happened. The guy who filmed the video + national media totally misrepresented what actually happened. The nuances of the actual situation are way too extensive and complex to discuss here.

Suffice to say that moderate and conservative views may be in the minority, but are not oppressed or attacked at Yale. There are multiple conservative student groups with significant membership.

Well, I understand that downvoting something you don't agree with is not treating someone unfairly. However, that is only downvoting specific comments. When someone gets downvoted regardless of what they say, then I would argue that that is unfair treatment (For instance, the fellow I was talking with wrote ""Absolutely!! At the end of the day, an education at Yale is unbeatable. Enjoy your time there! :)"", which was downvoted even though it had nothing to do with his conservative views. 

Although to be fair, that comment was only downvoted once while his other one expressing an actual view was downvoted 6 times.

>Depends on the view, honestly. If it's a view like ""Gay people should not be able to marry/have kids/live an equal life to me"" then it's not going to be met well. If it's something like, ""I think that a flat tax is a good idea"" -- well, people might question your economic skills, but they won't hate on you for being conservative.

So it seems like there is a lot more tolerance for fiscally conservative views than socially conservative views. I still see this as a problem because social issues are just as important to discuss too. 

>Shapiro? That one dude that makes shitty videos on ""librul colleges""?

No I wasn't even referring to him at all, but on an article citing specific experiences that conservatives at Yale have faced ([Source](https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4410-conservative-at-yale)), as well as just the general treatment in response to the professor who believed that wearing Halloween costumes should be a form of freedom of expression to be protected.

Requested Yale AMA,whoeverwhatever,"Sure! Basically, about two months after you commit, you will receive your housing assignment, which tells you who your roommates are and which residential college you are a part of. There are 14 residential colleges on campus, and you will be sorted into one randomly (unless you have legacy in one or a sibling attending Yale, in which case you can choose if you want to be in the same one).

In each residential college you'll find dorms, a dining hall, a library, a buttery (a chill place to hang out and get late-night food), a writing tutor, and tons of other great stuff (for example, mine has a dance studio and a gym). You'll live in your residential college throughout your four years here (unless you transfer, which people don't generally do) and it becomes a pretty tight-nit community. Each residential college has its own events and traditions, intramural sports teams, etc., and you pretty quickly get to know people in your college.

One addendum: for most colleges, freshmen live on old campus their first year (a separate part of campus with freshman-only housing). You still live with people from your college, but separate from the rest of your residential college. I never lived on old campus, but from what friends say it seems like a great way to get to know other freshmen (and lots of parties, etc going on there).

School Atmosphere for Graduate Students,jayman1466,"I've done both undergrad and grad here - though I agree, the experience is very different between the two, I would absolutely not classify one as more ""fun"" than the other.

The main difference comes with 1) how you interact with the University and the surrounding city of New Haven, and 2) how you interact with academics at an intellectual level. 

When you're an undergrad, EVERYTHING you do is Yale-centric. You live on campus, you eat on campus, all your friends are other undergrads, your free time is spent doing Yale extracurriculars, and all the parties are on campus. Besides the one or two bars I would sometimes hang out at on the weekends, it was easy to forget that there was anything but Yale in New Haven. In retrospect, the undergrad ""Yale Experience"" was pretty strongly curated; there were a lot of checks in place to make sure you were doing well, which is appropriate for kids leaving their parents' home for the first time. 

As a grad student, things feel a bit more expanded. I've finally explored life in New Haven outside the university. I live in a nice house in a residential neighborhood, spend weekends on long bike rides along the Connecticut coastline, spending time on the beaches along the way, have been hitting up all the local music venues discovering a vibrant local scene, have started touring the dozens of craft breweries that are around here, have started caring about local politics, going to all the local music festivals, fun runs, and so on. If anything, I probably drink more in grad school than undergrad, it's just a difference of where: local whiskey bar vs frat party. Sometimes you forget that you're even at Yale, but in a good way - you're no longer trapped in an insular bubble and finally become a citizen of New Haven. 

Intellectually, as an undergrad at a liberal arts institution, you're encouraged to explore widely and discover. This is great, but comes at the expense of focus and expertise. I was friendly with several of my professors but I never could consider myself their peer. Grad school is liberating in its focus. You develop yourself as a world-class expert in your field, grow close to your department, and begin to consider faculty as both mentors and peers. 

So, sure, huge difference in atmosphere, but it more reflects differences in the way an 18 year old should interact with university life vs a 25 year old. But these differences definitely didn't correlate with fun for me.

great, unique advice man. now OP knows to try hard.

I'll expand: transfer applications need to demonstrate that you've already established a major and how Yale is a better fit than your current university. You almost *need* to have a major declared and explain why the current college does not meet your goals.


Further, the essay does not look to see how you are as a person as much as how much you've achieved in your year or two at your college. You would need to explain how you took advantage of the resources and applied them to your major.

Opinions of Stats & Data Science Major?,DryFish037,"Current S&DS student. Technically the Stats department has been around since, I wanna say, the 50's or 60's. So it's not really a new major, just a name change and an expansion of courses. 

Imo, the most unique aspect of the major is how flexible it is. It's one of the few where you can pick and choose your major courses from a HUGE selection of courses even outside of the major. You can check it out [here](https://statistics.yale.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/major-glance).

Because of this, some students take more theoretical, math-intensive courses and some students take more skills-based courses, even some using a lot of their credits for CS courses. It's up to you.

Of course, this also means you'll probably enjoy your classes since you'll avoid what you don't want to take.

Professor-wise, there's a core set of really brilliant amazing professors like Dan Spielman and Winston Lin. (My favorites). Honestly, the professors are fine and theyre like any other Yale deptarment; all brilliant and very kind people.

My only advice is that you shouldn't set yourself on being a double major. It's not that it's too rigorous. If you double major, you'll tie your hands and won't have much room outside of requirement classes. You'll have a more fulfilling and fun time if you use your time to explore a variety of courses outside of the Stats/Econ realm.",8,,False,fs063vz,False,False,1590604228.0,2020-05-27 13:30:28

What 231 and 250 teach is what you need to know to understand vector calc at a high level and go on to more math. On the other hand, if you ever need multi for something outside of pure math, 231 and 250 will be fairly useless, or at best require you to do a lot of work to convert your knowledge into a useable form. I know quite a few people who took 230 as first years without multi and later regretted it because they ended up having to teach themselves multi for other classes or purposes.

Math at Yale,hilbertintherain,"I am an undergrad deeply involved with the pure math community, and my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. 

The center of the math community is the math lounge on the 4th floor of DL, which is a social/study space for undergrads, grad students, and professors. Here it's common to see undergrads chatting with senior faculty, which is rare in bigger departments (some of which even isolate their best professors in a separate institute away from undergraduates \*cough\* Princeton \*cough\*). 

In terms of research, the department hosts an REU called SUMRY that is open only to Yale undergrads. This is a great option to have, as SUMRY drawing from a small applicant pool makes getting a place much easier than, say, Williams. That said many people do spend their summers at Williams and the like. 

Taking one to three math courses per semester is typical, but of course if you want to take more and are capable of doing so no one will stop you. Most frosh who are set on doing pure math and have seen proofs before will take math230 and math350 in their first semester. 

One potential downside of being a smaller department is that there isn't a huge variety of undergrad courses beyond the core sequences.  But in practice I don't think this is a big deal, as it ends up pushing students to take grad courses, and you will never run out of interesting grad classes to take.",2,,False,flo1rwv,False,False,1585330030.0,2020-03-27 12:27:10

Math at Yale,l00p73,"Thanks for the detailed answer!

I have a couple more questions: in the Yale course search it says that Math 380 is the same as 500 (Modern Algebra I). Is the 380/381 500/501 algebra sequence then essentially a cross listed sequence that both undergraduates and graduate students can take for credit? 

Also, do you know anything about skipping the 230/231 sequence and starting with Real Analysis? (I have covered most of the topics in college courses taken while in high school and have extensive experience with proofs).

I saw that only 20-25 students graduate each year majoring in Mathematics. How small are intermediate/upper level/graduate classes?!?",1,,False,flqs8eb,True,False,1585404881.0,2020-03-28 09:14:41
Math at Yale,hilbertintherain,"380/381 is in fact the same as 500/501. It's a sequence taught at the graduate level (in the sense that after taking it, one is basically prepared to pass the algebra qualifying exam), but enough undergrads take it that the department gave it an undergraduate number. The situation with 320/325 and 520/525 is similar, which is the graduate analysis sequence. 

Even for students who've seen most of the topics before, I would recommend taking 230/231. The psets are fun even if you've already seen the topics (for example, most of the psets from 230 contained a Putnam problem). I'd also use the psets as a chance to review and consolidate your knowledge of basic analysis and linear algebra, since no one will stop to make sure you know that stuff ever again in your life. Lecture is highly optional. 

If by real analysis you mean math 300 or 301, I don't know much about those classes. People who do 230/231 don't have to take them. 

230/231, 350, and 305 have a fair amount of people, but all the classes at a higher level than that are very small. This is great, as it makes getting to know the prof not just easy, but unavoidable.",1,,False,flr0yyd,False,False,1585410667.0,2020-03-28 10:51:07
Math at Yale,EgoSumAbbas,"hey. definitely take 230/231. covers a lot more than just analysis, and it's a core part of the pure math experience. if you feel it's a bit too easy, consider adding math 350 (abstract algebra) first semester. take 305 (real analysis) freshman spring or sophomore spring in addition—so far, that's my favorite class i've taken at yale, its current professor is incredible.

230/231 has changed a lot over the past few years. 4 years or so ago, it was (in my opinion) a little harder than it should have been, and only really had like 8 students per year. for the past few years, it relaxed a lot, and expected far less prior knowledge, which has really resulted in a lot more people joining the pure math major—it was a little too easy though, in my opinion, and coming from a good math competition background, i was left wanting something a little more challenging. both professors are gone now, though, and it'll be something totally new next semester. either way, it's an essential experience. take it",1,,False,fm3hk1t,False,False,1585723757.0,2020-04-01 01:49:17
Math at Yale,l00p73,"Thanks for the response!

Actually I am considering skipping 230/231 *because* it covers more than just analysis - the linear algebra, and point-set topology topics I've seen listed in a 230 syllabus are not new to me (haven't seen a 231 syllabus tho). I'd rather focus on real analysis (which I have yet to take) than take a mixture of analysis with concepts I've already been exposed to.

I'm going to try to pair 350/370 with 301/305 first year. Or else I'll just do 230/231 with the algebra sequence. Hopefully it won't prove too difficult! I've heard the 230/231 psets take forever.

Math at Yale,EgoSumAbbas,"Pat Devlin is an assistant professor on his last year, sadly.

You do you, but I definitely recommend shopping all these courses before making decisions, and I recommend talking to Miki (the math DUS, essentially department head). You also shouldn’t discount the value of taking 230/231 with the rest of your freshman class. The linear algebra also wasn’t new to me, and though I found it a little on the easier side, it was def worth it (altho i do regret not taking something to accompany it). 

Also, 301 isn’t really meant for math majors, afaik most people in it are Econ or Stats people who don’t wanna do 305 since it’s known for being a pretty tough class. I don’t think I’d recommend it over 230, personally.

How much more difficult are joint majors?,tell-me-your-wish,"If you're interested in both fields/would take courses in them anyways, not much. 

To put things into perspective, you need a minimum 36 credits to graduate. A major ranges from around 10-18 (CS is 10 for the BA and 12 for the BS), and distributional requirements would be roughly another 10 credits. Thus, if you're doing a single major, you have about 8-16 free credits, which is enough to do a combined major (or perhaps an entirely separate major) with the bare minimum courseload. 

One thing you might want to be careful about is scheduling the difficult classes in each major. For econ + cs, for example, you wouldn't want to take CPSC 323 with econometrics (I'm not very familiar with the econ major but I think that's considered a difficult class?)",8,,False,eux5eq7,False,False,1564083506.0,2019-07-25 14:38:26

The Northeast is intense, fairly high strung. Take the cultural and ethnic diversity that you’re probably accustomed to and multiply it by two or three. Likewise population density. 

You have a panoply of outstanding dining options at your beck and call, and the university is one of the great founts of wisdom and culture in the world - the libraries and art and science museums are excellent. 

It will probably help if you are relatively low stress, confident and open to new experience.

Crime can be a factor, although the campus is a relatively secure oasis, and the city has much, much lower crime rates than it had three decades ago in the late 80s and early 90s.

I’m at Yale... as an Operations Coordinator,Ziddletwix,"Well in some ways it's a fairly typical college town.  Sounds like it'll be bigger and a bit more urban than you're used to. New Haven has unusual structure, because so much of the area around downtown is part of Yale, which obviously changes a lot during the summer. But as I said, the actual town itself is basically unchanged outside of campus, certain places are just less crowded. There's a food scene that punches a fair bit above its weight for city size (it's not the selection you'd find in NYC, but New Haven has very good food). There's a lively enough bar scene, there will be plenty like that. Like, there's not much point even listing bars, because there are a dozen+ solid ones to check out, New Haven is a fair sized city.

Unfortunately, as far as I know, the poker options are slim (I enjoy the game myself). I don't doubt there are home games around, so you should ask on /r/newhaven, but I've looked into it myself and there isn't much of a thriving scene (no bar runs weekly tournaments, no local card room, etc). There's casinos, but they're close to an hour away (but if you're willing to make the trip on a weekend, they're plenty good). Yale has a poker club, which I've never joined but I follow along vaguely, unfortunately over the summer they just play online (afaik), so that wouldn't be much help.

114 is designed to train you not only how to write a basic academic paper but also how to do academic research. I would caution you that 114 is not an easy course exactly; for most instructors it requires a sizable time commitment as you'll be writing four papers and due dates can sometimes be somewhat close together.

Yale will also be cheaper for you than public school in all likelihood.

The outliers did worse and the really great ones got nothing marked off. Pretty standard stuff really. The exams were designed to probe information covered in class and they weren’t any more challenging at the gen bio level than they would be at any other school. 

What I learned In college (the hard way) May be helpful: Prep for your lectures a little, stay awake in class, go to office hours if you’re not clear on something, and review the materials a little before the next lecture so you don’t get behind.

Thinking about applying to Yale next year... How would you current yalies consider the mental health support system like?,mattsulli,"Good and bad. I am a grad student who has been with two separate physicians specifically for meds management. The first guy was fine, very clinical, nothing really worked though. My second year I was placed with another physician, and she was great. I was also struggling with an eating disorder at the time while being treated specifically for the underlying issue, bipolar 1. On one instance during an extended fast she walked me down to acute care and I was quickly moved to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where I waited in the ER for about six hours and was transferred to another hospital that had a bed open, and I stayed there for about four days receiving medical treatment but not really any psychological treatment. I eventually ended up taking a medical leave of absence and was assured that I could come back after one semester. I checked back in after that semester and was told that they only allow two semester leaves. I’m starting my final semester next week and I can’t say that I’ve been happy with how the situation was handled, but at least I got some help. 

And by help, I mean that I lost my Yale Health coverage which forced me to find a psychiatrist not affiliated with the school. My new doc is great and I’m sticking with her. 

Edit to address stigma and support issues: something I’ve learned repeatedly as an open and honest person with a mood disorder is that people in your life will genuinely want you to get better, but they will treat you differently. They will show concern for your mental health, and they will treat you with kid gloves. Any time they think you’re “off”, they’ll make sure you know, and you’ll feel like it’s your fault. I’ve always thought it was important to let people know what was going on with me. I’ve learned that it’s better to keep a tight circle.

They are painfully understaffed and it has been a major issue in the past few years. 

That said, we have been working with Yale Health to address this and the administration is aware of how bad it is.

Thinking about applying to Yale next year... How would you current yalies consider the mental health support system like?,justanotheryalie,"I'm going to give what may be an unpopular opinion, but if you have a recent history of illness that has landed you repeatedly in hospital, Yale is not a good choice. Neither are many of its peers who have similar mental health policies. 

I should stress that this does not apply to the majority of students at Yale who have mental health issues. It is only relevant if you will be involuntarily hospitalized, and even then, if you're at the more severe end of the spectrum. Otherwise Yale has pretty good mental health resources compared to other colleges - much better than at my graduate school.

I was hospitalized three times (twice involuntarily) during my senior year a few years ago, when I was diagnosed with Bipolar I and Alcohol Abuse Disorder, as well as misdiagnosed with BPD (which was quickly crossed off my record at home). I had previously been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder too. Despite having pretty high grades and a job lined up, it was a real battle to stay at school after the first admission for a suicide attempt. I know that Yale wanted me to leave, but I was eventually allowed to stay on, on the condition that my mother drop all of her professional and personal duties back home (in a foreign country) and stay with me on campus. I don't even think this concession would have been offered if the head of mental health hadn't taking a strong liking to my mother, who met her in person. 

After the second admission I wasn't forced out, on the condition that I did an Intensive Outpatient Program and did not spend time in the colleges until after winter break (I was discharged during finals). After an extreme manic episode weeks later, I was forced to leave. I was supposed to be on an involtunary withdrawal, but for health insurance reasons this would have declared me legally bankrupt and I would have never been permitted to re-enter the US. My dean and parents went in to bat for me, and I was eventually allowed to take an involtunary medical leave of absence. I did need to interview to return, but thankfully the technicalities meant that I didn't have to take courses in my absence.

In terms of the quality of care... I had a therapist who I didn't click with and basically every session was ""I think you need to go to hospital"" and a psychiatrist who was condescending at times. On the plus side, I was able to see or call my clinicians every day. Yale also offers group therapy, which could have been good, but I wasn't eligible to go.

I would also ask yourself whether an environment like Yale is good for your triggers (be they stress, competition, sleep deprivation...). I can tell you that a lot of Yalies have eating disorders of varying levels: in my freshman year suite, I think 30% had diagnosed eating disorders and one had to take off a lot of time for rehab. Eating disorders are very prevalent among high achieving perfectionists, as I'm sure you're aware. 

Yale is a great school and all, and for most of the students who have diagnosed mental illnesses, it provides pretty solid resources. It's only really for half a dozen students a year that it can destroy your future. If you've attempted suicide, the chances are higher than average that you will fall into that category, but only you know where you are in recovery. There's also a myth that Yale hospitalizes students willy-nilly, which I haven't found true - I've also spent time in hospitals away from campus so have that benchmark. 

Yale's mental health policies made me have to rescind my job offer and change my major. It meant that my mother had to use the leave she had accrued through ten hard years of work to play suicide watch in a foreign country. It destroyed the thesis I had been preparing for over several years. At the time, I thought it had ruined my life, but it ended up being OK. A few years on - I've finally found meds that work, I'm happy with what I'm doing, and I had the smarts to choose a graduate school with a healthier approach to severe mental illness.

Yale is very quick to involuntary hospitalize. When they did it to me, it was a mistake and they all knew it -- but the doctors aren't allowed to release you, doctors outside the Yale system, unless Yale says so. I remember my elderly mother crying in the lobby, because they wouldn't tell her what was going on, wouldn't let her see me, and wouldn't let her transfer me to a different hospital. The kicker is my mom is a psychiatric hospital nurse.

They took my cell phone at admissions -- I actually had a missing persons report out for me.

Four days of hell, and because they realized it was a mistake, me continuing at Yale was never a question. However, I failed everything and psychologically it messed me up. I ended up there because I'm severely ADHD and Yale refuses to prescribe ADHD medication for 99% of cases -- it's physically in their policy. Naturally, I had a severe reaction to getting cut off.

Activists Target Early Career Scientist for Benefical Research,Silverseren,"> Dr. Christine Lattin is a Yale University researcher studying the effects of climate change, habitat destruction and invasive species encroachment on bird behavior.  Her research has made her a rising star in the field of animal behavior and she is amazingly well published and highly cited for an scientist only recently past her doctoral degree. But now animal activists have targeted her with career-damaging personal harassment, and now they are poised to demonstrate in front of her home.

> The research in question uses a variety of cutting-edge live imaging methods to understand neuroreceptor levels, hormone levels and other factors that are related to avian behavior. Dr. Lattin’s work studies house sparrows (an invasive species displacing native bluebirds) as subjects so there is no impact on natural ecology. By understanding the physiology that underlies bird stress, she gains a better picture of how such manifestations occur across vertebrates, potentially including humans.

> All procedures are heavily scrutinized and approved by Yale’s IACUC panel, which sets rigorous guidelines on animal research and animal care. All experiments are performed with strict ethical oversight.

> But this work to understand and ultimately save birds has raised the ire of PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), and they have responded with personal intimidation and concerning harassment.  PETA has posted flyers around the Yale campus stating Dr. Lattin’s name. They showed up at a scientific conference and stood meters away holding placards claiming that she was torturing animals. They have posted harassing videos in social media and provoked defamation online, along with her home address.

Yale Engineering Grad School Questions,FishFilet1337,"Yale's grad engineering department hosts monthly happy hours and other random events. However, unlike undergrad, there is pretty limited opportunity to mingle with other engineering disciplines in a ""formal"" capacity beyond classes in first year. Grad life at Yale in general is good as it receives ample funding from the school.

As far as job opportunities and professional goals go, you'd be hard pressed to find a place with more connections. Yale may not be a power house school of engineering specifically (like MIT, JHU, etc) but there are several notable and highly successful alums from each department. If you ever wanted to pivot towards engineering from a business or legal perspective, there are lots of resources to facilitate that as well. There are ample resources and opportunities to make connections and have a successful career.

Why Yale for a CS master's?,throw-away-875,"I'm only an undergrad, but have some experience working with the formal methods group. Plenty of undergrad and masters students work in the lab I'm at every year. From what I've seen, you should have no problems finding a research mentor as a CS student at Yale.

However, be aware that unlike PhD students, letting you do research is not an *obligation* for any professor - if they mentor you it is because they are just being helpful and want you to learn. What this means is that you probably will not get much hand holding or special funding. Depending on your experience level, you will probably be assigned to some PhD student already working in the lab, or to some side project of the professor. If you prove yourself capable, then you may find yourself getting more responsibilities or say in what to work on. 

On the more practical side of things, this means that unlike PhD students, you won't get your own office, or be 'matchmaked' with a professor, but instead have to rely on your own initiative. Then again, I'm pretty certain this is universal across all universities.

Generally the department is small, but growing and generally very friendly. Master's students are mostly from China and generally very smart, but don't have much interaction with undergrads due to the language barrier. Professors are all fiendishly clever and capable, but the quality of their classes varies.

Political Science vs. Global Affairs vs. Both,jeopardyman,"I'm going to disagree with the other comment. Global Affairs does not approximate an international relations major if what you mean by that is the study of diplomacy, armed conflict, trade, etc. Granted, you will learn about those things through global, but global affairs is more of an international business major than anything. Check out the [major requirements](https://registrar.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/GLBL%20Roadmap.pdf). 

&nbsp; 

A couple things to point out here. One, you'll see that of the 13 required courses, three are in econ, and three other quantitative courses are required. So 6/13 courses are statistics/economics-oriented and not at all political. The remaining electives are yours to choose and can all deal with international relations in the traditional sense if that's what you want. 

&nbsp; 

Also note the language requirement (which is on top of the 13 other courses). Going through L5 is definitely intense. If you're already fluent in a language besides English, you're golden, I wouldn't even worry about it. But if your skill level skews toward the more elementary side of things, definitely bear in mind that sizable commitment. 

&nbsp; 

To talk poli sci, there are five areas of concentration within the major: political philosophy, analytical political theory, American government, comparative politics, and international relations. You must choose at least one to concentrate in. Besides that, the requirements are extremely lax. Basically, take 12 courses labeled PLSC, and you'll graduate with a poli sci degree (although there are a couple different tracks through the major, the 12-course one is the easiest. Happy to speak more about this if you'd like). 

&nbsp; 

Now to compare and contrast, the lowdown is basically this. PLSC is way more hospitable to double majoring, although it can be done with global. PLSC has no language requirement. Also PLSC lets you take 2 classes of your major requirements as Credit/d/fail (our version of pass fail). Global does not allow you to do any cr/d/f. 

&nbsp; 

On the other hand, global effectively integrates multiple discipline areas into a major in a way that plsc doesn't. So if you take 5 econ courses as a poli sci major, you basically have nothing to show for it on paper, how much that matters is up to you. Global gives you a very strong foundation in economics without making you commit to a full econ major. It also gives you the inside track to taking classes with some practitioners of global affairs -- I'm talking former UN Ambassadors, coordinators of the coalition provisional authority, etc. I will say that the practitioners are not always the best instructors, but whether that tradeoff is worth it is, again, up to you. 

&nbsp; 

I'm a poli-sci major, full disclosure, but I truthfully do not care at all what you pick. My semi-cautionary tone about global only comes from the fact that many students are drawn by the allure of EP&E and Global as ""selective majors."" And that prestige factor honestly doesn't exist. Everybody will get a Yale diploma, your future boss won't know that you had to apply to major in global affairs instead of poli sci with a concentration in international relations. So my only advice is: make your decision based on the actual major experience, not based on what you think the perception of the majors is.

If you're majoring in geophysics you probably won't be doing proofs, I would recommend MATH 222 (non-proof linear algebra) or ENAS 194 (non-proof differential equations), which are commonly taken by STEM that aren't math majors such as engineers, physicists, etc. MATH 225 is proof-based linear algebra and MATH 250 is proof-based real analysis which are usually taken by CS/Math majors who drop down from the 230/231 intro track (easier than 230/231, only take though if you're really interested in proofs). 

TL;DR: Don't take 230/231, 225, or 250 unless you're thinking about being a math major. Go for non-proof courses like MATH 222 or ENAS 194 which will be infinitely more useful for you.",11,,1593467553.0,fwegrbz,False,False,1593460956.0,2020-06-29 15:02:36

Yes, it's certainly less practical & useful than the alternatives for a major in geophysics. But, I'd still recommend you consider 230/231 for a few reasons:

* Since you've already taken some advanced math in high school, it sounds like you wouldn't struggle to pick up the practical stuff you need for your coursework
* If you enjoy math, you'll likely enjoy 230/231, and it is good to do things you enjoy lol
* People change their majors all the time! Not sure if this applies to you, but if you haven't crossed math or physics off your list, 230/231 might change your mind

Not sure how things have changed today, but I've also heard more good things about the prof/course for 230/231 than 225/250.",4,,False,fwf7543,False,False,1593474252.0,2020-06-29 18:44:12
math 230/231 vs math 225/250,DryFish037,"I'm going to try to not push for either and give you the most objective answer.

Math 230/231 is very proof-based and things you learn are mostly in the pure math realm. You will be learning about math that's not necessarily focused on what you expected going in and you will be working alongside a lot of math majors. This class is incredibly difficult but therefore inherently fulfilling when you finish it. (Keep in mind, though, I've heard the professor is changing). Take this class if you don't mind learning things that aren't related to your major (at all really) and don't mind a challenge.

Math 225 (and it's sister course Math 222). Both focused on linear algebra. Math 225 is proof-based but not as rigorous as Math 230/231. Math 222 is the applications version of 225. You'll get a lot of depth in Math 222 but a lot of breadth in Math 225. Take Math 222 if you want to be able to do more calculations/applications vs Take Math 225 is you want to understand the theories behind linear algebra concepts. (You'll learn theories in Math 222 but won't spend much time on the proofs behind them). Oh btw, Math 222 is easier than 225.

Math 250 is kind of the natural progression after Math 225 or Math 222 but it's also proof-based. You can go from 230 to 231 to 250 or 222/225 to 250.

Keep in mind that professors may change so different aspects of the class may change accordingly.

That said, 225 still gets better reviews than 222! 

I would tell any prospective physics major to take 225 or 230/231 because the quantum mechanics sequence uses fairly abstract linear algebra (Hilbert Spaces!!!).

As an engineering major, looking those up and learning how to do them is a pain every now and then.  

That said, I learned so much in 230/231 and they're some of the best classes I've taken at Yale. They taught me to think about math as being about objects and structures and relationships between them, instead of being about computing answers to a problem. Plus, the math itself is super cool and you get to meet people working on psets. (I also took 231 Cr/D, which was sick and really helped me not stress as much about the workload!)

Econ 115?,jeopardyman,"Econ 115 is cash. Very popular course for first-years, although you'll meet a smattering of seniors if you talk to people on the way out of the auditorium. Two lectures a week (make sure to attend, even if you tell yourself you can skip and catch up later, you can't. it's a rookie mistake). One problem set per week, 7-10 questions. And the problem sets are graded very generously, so as long as you put in a good effort and kinda get the concepts, you're likely to be looking at a 100 in the homework because the lowest 2 pset grades are dropped. Three assessments - midterm 1, midterm 2, and final. They take place during the regular class period. The course is graded on a curve, so 40% get A's, 40% get B's, 20% get C or lower. However, the curve is more generous than meets the eye, because people that drop the course automatically are lumped into that bottom 20%. 

Also, the course is actively designed for people with no Econ experience. Literally all you need is a grasp of Algebra 1, so no experience in Econ is no problem at all! And another thing, you may be considering double majoring in CS and Econ, but there's also an interdepartmental degree - CSEC - which is a single major that does both comp sci and econ. Look at both, if you do the interdepartmental, you'll have more free slots in your schedule to do other things. If you do the double major, you'll have deeper knowledge in each area. Good luck!

Also, econ 115 (intro micro) does have a seminar variant that is mentioned below. I would advise against taking that for nearly anyone. 1) Both are graded on the same curve, but you don't see people drop out of the seminar like you do the lecture, so getting that A/A- is harder. and 2) being accountable for attendance and participation literally every lass is tough, and while yes you should attend every lecture, if you have something come up, your absence from it wouldn't even be noticed. Plus you'll have a weekly section (don't worry, attendance isn't mandatory) that will go over the lecture content in a seminar-like setting, which is especially helpful if you have to miss.

How badly do you have to do to get a D in a class?,Kovarian,"It's definitely possible to fail. And like /u/Prismatic_Effect said, it's easiest when you skip class.

I got a great grade in 116 but in the end it really wasn’t worth all the work it cost me and also the fear I had for math courses at Yale after that. I’ve gone through linear algebra 120 and diff eq but i feel like 116 was still my hardest math course at Yale.

Is this a doable schedule/workload?,Kovarian,"Walking between those classes should be enough. Some might be a bit up Science Hill (math and the globalization thing), but all will be fine for physical movement. A 130 language class should be ok for you, but don't ignore that one. Languages have a habit of starting easy and then hitting you hard a couple weeks in. You can do it, but beware.

Overall, this looks like a fairly hard first-semester schedule. It's definitely doable, but be prepared to cut something if need be. Unless you're an econ major, I would cut the econ; it's the class most likely to be time-intensive and it's in the worst timeslot on your schedule (assuming mornings aren't your hangup). If you are an econ major, then one of the Time or GLBL classes should be on the chopping block.

All that said, you should NOT have a schedule locked in before arriving on campus. Shopping period is the best thing Yale has. Add a few more classes and see which you prefer. Maybe these work for you, maybe they don't. Have backups. Be prepared.

Is this a doable schedule/workload?,Kovarian,"I would advise against tossing PHYS. Given the names and the rest of your schedule, I assume you have that on there as a ""seems like fun!"" class. Keep that one. You will want a class that you look forward to and enjoy, even if it isn't ""right"" for your plan.

Econ doesn't look good to me because it's right after lunch (meaning you rush your afternoons), it's a long block (meaning you slog through it), and it's right before another big class (meaning your afternoon is just one big thing). It's just... awkward.

(at this point I talked to my wife about your schedule. She also went to Yale); (oh yeah, this is old-person advice. About 10 years out. Take that with whatever grains of salt are needed).

Our opinion after this conversation is that your econ class should go. 5.5 is a lot for a freshman, and 4.5 is much better. Your PHYS class is going to be fun as a freshman seminar, and you should take it (have you been accepted, by the way? That affect a lot here). You should take a language, but is an L3 really right for you? You hope to test into it, but if you didn't get a 5 on the AP it's questionable whether it's going to crush you or be a cruise. The jump from L2 to L3 is intense. L2 reminded me of high school; L3 made me comfortable in my language's country. So take a long hard personal look at why you got a 4: if you deserved the 4, maybe an L2 is better; if you deserved a 5 but aren't good at standardized tests, then L3 can be fine. But that's your intense class.

You seem confident about your MATH class. That's good, because that's going to be an intense one. But if you tested in and want to major in something in that area, then it can work.

The GLBL class seems like, in my wife's words, a ""do nothing then write a 20 page paper at the end"" class. So be prepared for that.

But that also means that dropping ECON will help with that. You will have all lunch and extra during M/W to do the reading. I didn't realize when I wrote my first comment why it seemed wrong, but it's because you will want the afternoon to do the reading for GLBL and ECON gets in the way. If you drop ECON (you can do it sophomore year if your GLBL plan fails and you fall back to ECON), then your days just become so much cleaner. Wake up, have a hard first few hours, then coast. That's not to say be lazy and don't learn, but it's easier to learn when you aren't stressed to no end. ECON, even if it itself isn't hard, will put stress on your schedule in the afternoon and evenings.

I guess the final advice would be to drop ECON, and maybe consider an L2 if you aren't super confident in your language ability.",4,,False,ewqn9ei,False,False,1565671304.0,2019-08-12 23:41:44
Is this a doable schedule/workload?,-man_sized_meatballs,"Wow, thanks for the in depth analysis and second opinion!! I really appreciate it!! 

Regarding French, I really should have gotten a 5 in my opinion— I missed the first testing date for a baseball game, so I had to take it on the retest date, which was the day before my graduation. At that point, I hadn’t heard the language in a week, did not study at all, and was mentally checked out already. But I’ll probably just play it by ear and see where the placement test puts me. I’m not opposed to taking L2. 

I hope I don’t have to drop ECON just because it’s pretty central to the direction that I eventually want to go, but I see what you mean about timing. I’ll definitely look to shift it around depending on my other classes fall. TBH, I probably won’t take the PHYS class (for which preregistration hasn’t yet opened, it just looked like the most interesting seminar to me). That’ll allow me to take the ECON section which is at the same time. 

I for sure want to take an easier, fun class, so I’ll spend some more time looking at the available seminars. One of the other comments in this thread said 5 classes is a lot, and that’s also what my parents have said— they’re reliving their college years vicariously. So I might just drop the GLBL class and stick with the Math, French, ECON, and a Seminar.

Hookup Culture at Yale,adamup27,"Ok, quick note here: I am not a Yale Student, I’m summer staff. That having been said, I’m a rising senior at a large, public, state school and a freshman RA so I’ve witnessed this often. 

While there are a lot of differences between my school and Yale, the freshman double is one similarity. Your options are to: talk to your roommate and be a respectful human being or not talk. Be aware that both options can create animosity but one reduces unwanted surprises. You will also have nights where your roommate just wants to sleep, this is actually a part of Yale that they do right, you all have semi-private common rooms in the suites. This luxury allows you to coordinate with your suitemates - note that I don’t mean schedule it but be a good person and send a text/imessage to them warning them as far in advance as you can. Again, preventing unwanted surprises. 

Now, let’s say you’re wanting us to focus on the literal hookup culture, then I’m going to wager that you’re a little too emotionally immature to just want casual sex. You’ll walk in week one thinking you’re all BDE and it will hit like a ton of bricks, no worries, it happens to nearly everyone. Hookup culture depends on your romantic preferences and groups. The LGBTQ community here is very active, so if you’re coming from a more geographically or politically southern area, you’ll have better odds of casual encounters. Outside (and inside) of that, Tinder and Bumble are both active. I’d argue it’s 50/50 or 60/40 in tinder’s favor. A far cry from my school. Bars here kind of suck (@me) so don’t rely on them and you likely don’t have a fake or one that’s good enough. The parties here are pretty legit though, I was honestly surprised by this. Some get a little out of hand because there is quite literally no authority at times (bet you weren’t expecting to hear that one from Mr. state-school) but most of the time it’s a good time or better. 

This was probably more information than you were expecting but it boils down to this: 
1.	Don’t be a dick 
2.	Try to prevent unwanted surprises 
3.	Stay Safe (see point above)

## Advanced Courses for First-year students

Students  with very strong backgrounds in chemistry and problem solving can  affirm their mastery of general chemistry by taking the departmental  placement examination. Sufficiently  well-prepared students are permitted to take an organic chemistry  course limited to first-year students, the sophomore-level organic  chemistry course, or junior-level physical chemistry. Completing an advanced course accelerates completion of the requirements for many majors and preprofessional programs.

Ellman used to teach fall 220 every year, until this year which is his first as GDS. If you wanna not take Orgo from such difficult professors, I've heard good things from people who take the 220/221 sequence on the off-cycle (ie. 220 in the spring, and 221 the next fall).

Chem for premed first year?,ypremedthrowaway,"Context: I just finished the Chem 174/175 sequence this year.

&#x200B;

Like the others have said, it'd be a good idea to take the placement test even if you're not sure about which course you want to take. However, the placement test is pretty easy, and I feel like this is intentional so they can fill the class to a decent size. So just because you place into 174 doesn't mean you may actually be able to do well in the class.

&#x200B;

Why do I say this? For one, there are many students in the class who have already taken orgo in high school, and because the class is curved, you'll be competing against people with prior knowledge. Also, the class in general has the reputation of having the top science students (which is expected--who else would take orgo willingly as a first-year?) so if you're gunning for an A as a premed, it might be hard.

&#x200B;

Second, if Scott Miller teaches, you will have extremely difficult tests. Even though the class had students who already took orgo, the averages on exams ranged from the 60s to the 70s. If you wanna take Orgo, maybe consider 220. The professor (Jon Ellman) taught the first half of Chem 175, and compared to Scott Miller's exams, Ellman's tests were exceedingly easy (almost elementary)--the average on the one exam he designed for 175 was an 88 I believe. Despite this, I really enjoyed having Scott as a professor. None of my other professors seemed half as passionate as him.

This is usually not an issue since most premed students are in a major where they have to take biochemistry or another type of advanced chemistry anyways, but it's just something to keep in mind.

Other information can easily be found just by Googling 'Yale premed chemistry requirements' or something similar.

I would recommend CHEM 161/CHEM 165 sequence if you place into general chemistry and are still thinking about premed, as these courses are designed for premed majors and are lighter on the more in-depth side of chemistry and you've mentioned you aren't particularly fond of chemistry and just want to get the requirement done. As for my recommendations on organic chemistry, I think Freshman Orgo (174) is doable but a lot of work as everyone else has commented on.

Considering you’ve only had Algebra II/maybe some precalc, I would highly recommend it.

There is a yearlong option, Math 110 and 111, which follows the curriculum of 112 that is also an option for less well prepared students. However, intro math essentially starts with calc, and most students taking Math 112 did take calculus in high school. You will be less prepared than the majority of the freshman class in terms of math, so I would recommend ONEXYS. I’m not aware of the program being that stressful or time consuming, it’s like any other summer/online class. An hour a day at the most.

Entrance interview,CordialOwl,"Hi there. I agree that they want to see that you're a normal person, and that overall, it is a relaxed interview. However, I think you might be underestimating how well many applicants (even to top schools) can hold a conversation with an adult, especially in a situation that is new and likely nerve-wracking. On this front, I think practicing some answers to common interview questions can help, and generally, going over these as if you are in an interview, just to get yourself more comfortable with answering. I had a lot of experience, mainly from debate, that helped me interview prep-free, but I have seen friends and talked to others who were helped greatly be practicing before, if for no other reason than simply being more confident in the interview (even if your answers are no better) and less nervous.

&#x200B;

Also, just practically speaking, there are things you need to prep. For example, you \*definitely\* need an answer to Why Yale, as this is the most common question I've seen asked (among admitted students this year), and you cannot just be yourself in this unless you have done more research and memorized more facts than the majority of applicants have. Although there is a Why Yale essay, it is only 125 words and many people do not use more than 1 or 2 specifics due to the length. I think being (again) confident in your answer to this particular question is key, and even more, having lots of specifics to dive into can \*really\* help convince the interviewer you're a great match for Yale and will contribute once on campus. Just minimal prep on classes, courses, or (more importantly) programs and such can, in my opinion, help show your interest. Very few applicants, many of whom have 10+ colleges on their list, can simply not prep and go in and knock it out of the park - obviously, some can, but they would be exceptions to the rule, I think. Another example, I feel that knowing your extracurriculars really well and your motivations behind them (this may seem obvious, but keep in mind neither the Common App nor the Yale App require you to discuss any extracurricular beyond simply descriptions unless you choose to write about them) can help show that you are more than just another applicant who does things just to get into college. Digging into why you do what you do \*before\* you're in a high-pressure interview can help to fly through these questions. And again, in my (admittedly limited) experience as well as talking to other admitted students, it seems rather common to be asked about at least one extracurricular.

&#x200B;

I hope this makes sense. I just would hate for a student who might not be used to intense conversations with adults or used to interviews, and who has not thought too deeply about Yale in particular among the other colleges, to go into this interview with no prep. It could go badly. This is really a chance to knock the socks off your interview if you practice your speaking skills and ability to hold the conversation and move it forward, \*and\* have a solid grasp on Why Yale and other common questions.",5,,False,ed9q5hu,False,False,1546653157.0,2019-01-04 19:52:37

There's a huge difference in being prepared and not. And reciting a canned answer versus having reviewed and practiced an interview a few times to be comfortable. Not everyone warms up to a one-on-one interviewer immediately nor is personal speaking a universal skill set.

Directed studies?,saltimmortalsea,"Hi there! Congrats on DS, and congrats on Yale! I'm not going to strictly advise you yea or nay, but I hope I can offer some nuances for your consideration. I'll answer your questions in order.

##**Will DS burden me in pursuing my science major?** 

Let's do the math! You're expected to take **36 credits** to graduate from Yale (though you're welcome to take more). I'm going to assume that you're pursuing a B.S. in either MCDB (Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology) or E&EB (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology), both of which have a **18.5 credit** requirement for the major—taking up a little over half of your coursework. Happily, as far as distribution requirements are concerned, that knocks out your **2 Science credits**, and **2 Quantitative Reasoning credits**. 

Your remaining distribution requirements are **2 Writing credits**, **2 Humanities credits**, **2 Social Science credits**, and **Foreign language**. Unfortunately, you can't double-dip distribution requirements—for instance, an English seminar can only count for Humanities or Writing, but not both. Still, Directed Studies can knock out any all of your Humanities, Social Science, and Writing credits if you complete both semesters of the program. Assuming you come in with a foreign language, you'll probably complete that in 3 credits (2 courses). So, 18.5 for your major, 6 for DS/distribution, 3 for foreign language—you're left with **8.5 credits to take whatever you want!** So credit-wise, you're good.

The tricky thing, of course, is being willing to not knock out a ton of those prerequisite classes for your major during your freshman year. As elucidated above, it won't make it impossible to graduate, but you'll probably be behind your peers. Rather than distributing your humanities/social science classes over the course of your Yale career—and choosing those out of the Blue Book—you'll instead concentrate most of that into studying the Western canon as freshman (more on that later). I had a number of friends in DS who went on to major in physics and chemistry and MB&B. One of them is in med school now! So no, DS isn't a burden to your major—it just shifts the timeline a bit.

##**Are they hard classes??**

Good question. Most people will tell you—of course! You have to read three books a week (or learn to pretend to) and write nine 5-7 page essays on a weekly basis (with breaks every four weeks or so) over the course of each semester. The time commitment is a little beyond your average humanities course, which is either two 2-hour lectures and a 1-hour section, or two 1.5-hour seminars. DS is one 1-hour lecture and two 1.5-hour seminars per class. The writing is really the hardest part: you're fresh out of high school, and suddenly expected to churn out college-level essays on a regular basis. One of the biggest problems with Yale pedagogy—and one that they're trying to remedy now—is the lack of writing tutelage within classes. Your DS professors may be a good resource in person, but often don't have the class infrastructure in place to teach writing. And the DS writing tutor is frankly awful—but the ones in the Writing Center are good! **My advice**: figure out what ""close reading"" means. Talk to your professors. It's far and away the best way to get through DS, and they don't always tell you!. Rather than writing on over-arching themes in any given work, zero in on a paragraph or two and analyze every last detail about it. Since most works are in translation, it's a little tricky to make arguments about diction and sentence structure, but anything else is fair game!

In the classroom setting, you'll be in a seminar with a randomly assigned professor and some 12 other freshmen in DS. If you're happy in the seminar setting, that's great! This is your chance to share in the pleasure of dusty old books and epics with like-minded people. Professors in DS come from a huge range of departments, so you might meet someone you might never have otherwise—I had a delightful, sunny Italian professor for literature in the fall. She laughed at everything, and enjoyed how new it was to all of us. ""I'm jealous of you,"" she told me, because I had so much ahead of me. I used to go to her office just to sit and chat about books and theatre and life. She ended up nudging me into my first Yale production—and hey!—now I'm doing a PhD in theatre!

The all-freshman aspect of the seminars is a trickier consideration. On the one hand, you're all equally bad/good. On the other hand, frankly, Yale freshman straight out of high school—people at the top of their class, most likely, with a strong sense of self-worth—are out to prove themselves in this new college environment. Sometimes that can be detrimental to the flow of conversation, as people are more eager to aggrandize themselves than actually promote discussion. (This can be true throughout all of Yale, really, but it's especially true in DS.) That said, there are plenty of good folks—find them, commiserate, enjoy their company. It'll be a good time.

I personally came out of high school with a strong background in seminar-style discussion, but little actual grounding in the *knowledge* of history and philosophy and literature. I was little taken aback when faced with the national champ of Lincoln-Douglas debates in my class, because she was totally fluent in Plato and Aristotle and I was just picking them up for the first time. Ultimately, that didn't matter. I got along fine in class, and found so much to love in the texts themselves. The range of books—especially in literature—was spectacular, and provides a referent for all the Western works that come after. I picked up *Hamlet* again at the end of the year, and suddenly understood so much more of it! It was thrilling.

##**What is the reputation for DS on campus?**

DS gets its reputation by perceived difficulty—and no wonder! You might get a few laughs about it (""why would you do that to yourself?!""), but ultimately you get respect for doing it, especially as a science major. I might add that imposter syndrome is particularly strong during freshman year, when people at the top of their class are suddenly merely average. It helps to have something to sustain your ego, frankly. And DS does that handily. 

##**Bonus: How will this affect my freshman year?**

I want to add that it's easy to let DS consume your freshman year, if you're not thinking right. This may sound obvious, but don't let the fact of your weekly paper get in the way of joining clubs or extracurriculars. It's very important to join most student groups *as a freshman*, because most of them want to have their members for four years. It's a lot tougher to try to join groups as a sophomore, so don't postpone because you think your coursework is heavy! (You probably won't start writing your essay until Thursday evening anyway.) 

I made the mistake of telling myself I'd audition for a cappella groups and so on as a sophomore. It worked out because I ended up joining a newly-formed group, but it's generally in the best interests of clubs to admit members as freshmen. I also ended up doing the ""freshman thing"" where I joined a **ton** of extracurriculars as a sophomore, while most of my friends had already done that and decided on the few clubs to which they really wanted to dedicate themselves. 

My friends still ask me why I took DS. I don't regret it. I guess I had less freedom to explore classes as a freshman, but hell, we read *Don Quixote* in two weeks and now I've outlined a stage adaptation of Nabokov's *Lectures on Don Quixote*. That's really the beauty of Yale, too. That—as a science major—this is open to you. These people are open to you. If literature and philosophy are an itch you want to scratch, can with the utmost style.

***

Let me know if you have any more questions (about DS or otherwise)! I know I just wrote far too much. As a closing note, I will say that I remained close to my first-semester History and Politics professor, who is now the head of the Directed Studies program. (I actually wrote bedtime stories for her son, but that's another story.) She says that the program is self-selecting. In past years, anyone who applied got in—so everyone in the program really wants to be there! 

P.S.: I just remembered. At all costs, do *not* do organic chemistry with Directed Studies. Repeat, **do not** do orgo with DS. That's insane. (And I know someone who did it.)",12,,1495673638.0,di06tx9,False,False,1495672421.0,2017-05-24 19:33:41
Directed studies?,,">What is the reputation for DS on campus?

Students here understand that DS is a hard program and respect it internally. There is, however, a running joke that DS students are just trying really hard to show off and can't go more than 5 minutes without mentioning DS. Ie, don't take it if you're just trying to be a DS student-- only take it if you genuinely want to spend essentially your entire freshman year dedicated to the program academically.

If you're a ""biology kid"" (I am too) then you probably won't want to be in DS, but as the other poster has said, it is certainly possible.",2,,False,di2irif,False,False,1495805502.0,2017-05-26 08:31:42
Directed studies?,Uile,"OP, virtually everything this person said is correct. And I think the ultimate question you should ask yourself is if you'd be happy dedicating the vast majority of your freshman year (academically) to studying ancient classics. If you look at the DS curriculum and are genuinely happy and excited to do it, then it can be an amazing experience. If you're hesitant, then I'd really think about it before signing yourself onto it (although you can drop it second semester).

I'd also strongly highlight that the DS curriculum, by design, is very western centric, and almost every work you will study is written by an old white man. If you're looking for a broader worldview, then there are lots of classes at Yale that will be more diverse. And this is a common complaint among people taking DS. 

Finally, I do want to disagree with /u/saltimmortalsea on the reputation of DS. Very few people are going to respect you *more* for doing DS as opposed to any other freshman course load (this may have changed since /u/saltimmortalsea did it in 2011, based on their tag). It may be true that DS students boost their own egos through DS, but if anything, students who are overly confident or even brag about DS are seen as annoying more than anything. I would strongly recommend not choosing DS if one of the main motivations is that others will respect you, as you'll be disappointed. ",4,,False,di0azr1,False,False,1495677816.0,2017-05-24 21:03:36

So what's the deal with the grad student hunger strike?,PhD_sock,"It's a little more complicated than that. Politics are intrinsically part of how a university operates. Undergraduates and to some extent graduates don't necessarily sense that, because the point of a well-oiled machine is to conceal the turning of the gears. Yale is kind of a mess when it comes to graduate student representation because there are several bodies (GSA, GPSS, the long-unrecognized union once known as GESO and then Local 33), and the division of labor is somewhat confused. That being said, some of the issues the union wishes to discuss or negotiate with Yale administration are a bit legitimate. For instance, TFs arbitrarily being tasked with teaching two courses in a term (standard load is one) without being offered extra pay. There have been incidents where serious confusion has resulted between departments and the admin concerning students on external fellowships (a common part of one's graduate career) and how that affects the students' funding and/or timeline toward completion of the PhD.

TLDR, there are issues that can be better resolved by a union, and generally speaking a student union is a good thing for all concerned. Public univs have had them for a long time and nobody's worse off. 

*However* GESO/Local 33's tactics are pretty problematic and I definitely do not support this ridiculous ""hunger strike"" in the least, and it is very troublesome that they attempt to justify it by positioning themselves in a revolutionary lineage invoking MLK, Gandhi, etc. 

But don't make the mistake of thinking that structural politics at Yale--and for that matter any academic institution--are far removed from ""teaching/learning."" They are very closely related.",6,,False,dgxobh5,False,False,1493526482.0,2017-04-29 23:28:02

1. EA interview reports are due December 1st (sidenote, send a thank-you note asap after your interview), but to echo other responses, don't worry about it.  Adcom meetings begin on Monday (I think, I know late November) and decisions go out mid-December.

1. Honestly, we're looking to link a human being to the paper application.  Be personable, excited about what makes you unique, and genuine.  Have a good ""elevator speech"" prepared (basically a summary of YOU, answering the infamous ""Tell me about yourself"" in 30 seconds to 1 min).  Most of the questions I ask are designed to get at who you are as a person, how flexible you are when exposed to different ideas, and how you'll make the most of your time at Yale.  ^2

Interview Questions- help!,Arboretum7,"I've been a Yale alumni interviewer in the past. As I remember, we only have your name, high school and intended major. Three pieces of advice to stand out:

Above all else, demonstrate curiosity and a relentless pursuit of passions. There are plenty of applicants that are good at playing the game of high school, but the ones that shine doggedly pursue interests beyond normal bounds. By way of example, tell me a story about how you learned about something in high school and then followed that interest out in the real world, maybe by becoming an active leader in a political cause, taking university courses, starting a new club, challenging the rules of your community, etc. They want to see how you left your mark on your community because Yale is looking for students that will challenge and augment it's campus, not just consume what it has to offer. If you look at the essay questions on the application, they're all around this theme.

Second, try to highlight a story about service. Yale is big on giving back to the community, so highlight how you've done this in yours. Talk about a specific problem in your community and how you've worked to alleviate it. One point here, it's en vogue to take service trips to other countries. I've heard about how going to build a school in Guatemala for a week changed peoples' perspectives ad nauseam. While cool, it doesn't demonstrate a sustained interest in a cause or a rooting in community and your interviewer has heard a lot of stories about similar trips.

Third, be different and preferably a little quirky. Like the service trip point above, avoid stories or topics that might be common. When you're asked what your favorite book is, don't talk about something that was assigned reading. I had one year where a third of my interviewees gushed about One Hundred Years of Solitude. It didn't take much to figure out that that was assigned reading in AP English. Similarly, I'd rather hear about a passionate jazz harmonica player than another violinist. If you're a little quirky, I'll remember you.

Interview prep can also be really helpful. Especially with EA candidates, this is often the applicant's first interview for anything and they're really nervous. Remember we're regular people and we all had to go through a Yale interview. If you have a non-parent adult in your life who regularly interviews job applicants at work, ask them to practice some behavioral interview questions with you (e.g. ""tell me about a time you faced a difficult problem and how you went about tackling it""). Practice giving responses where you set a context and then talk about actions you took and the results they garnered. Oh, also, don't let your parent tag along to the interview, dress in your normal clothes and don't bring a resume.

Anyhow, hope that helps! Feel free to PM me with any questions. Good luck!

What to expect at Yale over the summer?,Kovarian,"Only thing I know about:

For the transport from New York to Yale you want to take the Metro North train leaving Grand Central Station going to Union Station in New Haven. You can walk from Union Station to campus, but being new to the city and country, you'll want a cab. It will cost about $10 including tip (remember to tip when in America! Cabs, waitstaff, and people who cut your hair are the big ones you'll probably run into). The train used to be $14 one-way, not sure if prices have changed.

Top fancy restaurants include: Barcelona, Zinc, and Ibiza

The best coffee shops are: Willoughby's (best coffee) and Blue State (best coffee-shop feel)

Top Bars: Anything on Crown St., especially Cask Republic

The most popular nightclub is Toad's, but it's kind of sketchy.

Attractions:
East Rock, the actual park and the entire surrounding neighborhood; walking to Hamden and back on Whitney; exploring the Wooster Square area; eating at the historic restaurants, including Pepe's, Sally's; however, I wouldn't recommend Louis' Lunch. (It's usually packed, and its claim of inventing the hamburger is, at best, disputed); going to one of Yale's many museums; taking the 1.5 hour, $16 trip to NYC via Metro-North Railroad

Areas to Avoid:
Like any other city, there are places to avoid in New Haven as an out-of-towner: Dixwell Avenue and surroundings, Davenport Avenue and surroundings.

A reminder for those choosing courses,trippytoilets,"hey, care to elaborate on why DS is bad in combination with math 230? i'm considering DS but would also love to pursue math at a more advanced level. does DS really gobble up that much of your time? incoming freshman here btw.

A reminder for those choosing courses,,"*Copied verbatim from some advice I sent another pre-fosh, feel free to PM if you have specific questions. Regardless what you decide about DS, you're in for an amazing four years!*

Just so you get a feel for the program, here's the logistics (skip to the next paragraph if you're already familiar with the details etc). Directed Studies is three courses in one: History&Politics, Literature, and Philosophy. Each course has a lecture once a week, with all 120 DS students, and 2 seminar meetings (about 17-18 students). So, in total, I have 9 DS-related class meetings a week. Each professor has a different approach but most subscribe to a sort of interdisciplinary ethos, so we'll often bring in Dante (Literature) to contextualize Aquinas (Philosophy)—this is the program's way of acknowledging that the lines we draw between literature, philosophy, and history are not as clear-cut as we often make them out to be. Because you buy into DS as a package deal (it takes up 3 of your 4/5 classes), it doesn't leave you a lot of room to explore other course offerings. However, I think the program by itself gives its students plenty to chew on.

DS is a rigorous program—I've found it to be both intensive and rewarding. The sheer quantity of reading can occasionally be overwhelming, but I think the course justifies itself. I mean, I've progressed by leaps and bounds as a writer, and the program has honed the way I think critically about texts. The place where DS really shines, however, is in the classroom. My 3 DS professors challenge me on a daily basis, enlighten me with their insight, and broaden my horizons with their perspectives. They're also totally approachable, cool people--a few times this semester, the class discussion has spilled over into lunch with the professor.

It may be a cliché, but the most valuable part of DS has been my peers. They make class intellectually rich and provocative, sometimes outrageous, usually hilarious, and always compelling. Class is never a bore. The DS community extends way beyond the classroom--you develop a sort of DS camaraderie that fosters many a late-night cerebral argument over, say, the merits of Plato's ideal polis versus Aristotle's. It sounds awfully nerdy, and I guess it sort of is. But it's wicked fun. There's also a sense of shared commiseration between DS students: they understand, for example, how much trouble you're having proving your thesis, and they're willing (nay, eager!) to help you brainstorm. And in a community full of awesome, interesting people (i.e. Yale), DSers have been some of the most awesome and interesting people I've had the pleasure of meeting and knowing.

I realize I'm waxing poetic here and beginning to blather, but I hope you can glean something helpful from my remarks. 

Please feel free to contact me if you would like any clarifications or have any other questions.",3,,False,c4l82oa,False,False,1336421214.0,2012-05-07 15:06:54

Barnard/Columbia/Yale ED?,hitherescotty,"Folks in this sub are biased and will probably tell you Yale. 

There are a lot of factors here. What do you want to study? Are you looking for a flexible Liberal Arts education or, for example, applying to Columbia’s engineering school? Are there specific amenities at one college that pushes you towards that institution? How do you feel about NYC and New Haven? Is Early Action vs. Early Decision a deciding factor? (ED holds more weight than EA but if you get accepted ED you are locked in). Are you concerned that you might meet the admissions reqs for one school but not another?

Don’t know much about Barnard. But for me, Columbia’s big strength was that it granted access to NYC while Yale seemed to provide more of an on-campus, collegiate camaraderie. I grew up in the NY metro area and wanted to go elsewhere. When I visited Yale I fell in love with the residential college aspect. Yale and the residential colleges get a lot of comparisons to Hogwarts and for good reason. 

I chose Yale in the end. That residential college experience gave me lifelong friends that I still talk with daily, a decade later. And you can always hop on a Metro North train from New Haven and be in NYC in 90 minutes.

Yale is a special place. When I talk about my college experience with my peers, they act like I’m a weirdo for having such fond memories. But Yale was really the most magical part of my life, at least so far. I really liked visiting Columbia and NYC is an incredible city, but Yale does a hell of a job of making the campus feel like you’re living in a storybook every day.",27,,False,g57z2wr,False,False,1600083617.0,2020-09-14 06:40:17

Here, everyone can afford to study abroad, since the ones on financial aid basically get paid to do so.

Yale Directed Studies?,Gamerdude505,"Hi there, I’m taking DS at this moment! Addressing your first question about camaraderie, DS students take 6 75 min seminars per week and 3 50 min lectures per week, so sharing the same seminars with the same people really allows you to build a tight bond with some people. Also, you’d be surprised by how often DS kids come together and start talking about their syllabus. It’s incredibly easy to start a conversation and prolong as it as you will always have a subject in which the other party is guaranteed to be invested. All the work also really builds camaraderie, as your fellow DSers will understand your struggle writing a 5 page paper for the third (or if they mess up your schedule fifth) week in a row.
The workload is not easy, but it’s not as hard as some people might claim it to be. The paper itself is just 5 pages double-spaced, and usually you will always go past the page count. You will have a lot of resources and soon get used to writing. I usually spend 6-8 hours a week writing my paper not including “taking breaks”, and then spend 2-3 hours editing it. Consider that this is the only assignment for three classes per week, it’s really not bad. The hard part of DS is the reading. You have to often read 3 books, usually most of the book. That takes up a lot of time although the books are really interesting. If you don’t like reading or even that you are not skilled at reading, DS will be a struggle. Yet I feel that being invited into DS means this won’t be an issue for you. Lastly, I’ve found that balancing DS with extracurriculars is even easier than taking regular courses. Your schedule is the same every week that you never have to worry about something else popping up. You will never get a lot of work in one week because they coordinate the papers.

Global Affairs Major,nutmegged_state,"Hi! I was a GA major a couple of a years ago. Someone asked this same question several months ago so I'll copy-paste parts of my answer from then: 

They don't publish statistics on the number of applications (to my knowledge) so the best we can do is estimate, but another poster in that thread said that in a recent year, roughly 200 applied and 60 got in. That sounds about right to me. The application itself (when I did it) involved basically two short answer questions about why you want to do the major.

The advice I got (which worked for me I guess) is that the key is just to demonstrate that you're genuinely interested in the subject. The fact that it's influencing your decision to go to Yale is a good sign of that! The other advice I go was to demonstrate interest by taking courses towards the major in  your first and sophomore years (GA courses, econ/language requirements, etc.). And having a good rationale for taking the major to put on your application. Some people apply just as a ""prestige"" thing or basically on a whim, so a lot of the application is sorting out those people. 

If you don't get in, there are other ways to study related subjects. You can major in political science with and do an IR track; you can major in one of the area studies majors; if you're interested in health, you could apply for the global health program. 

In general, though, I'd encourage you not to make your decision about college *solely* based on the program you want to major in. Lots of people change their minds about their major, so it's more important to pick a school that's a good fit in other ways. 

I will say, in the interest of full disclosure, that I have some regrets about choosing GA (though none about choosing Yale). I think there are a lot of aspects of the program that are great, but flaws as well. A big one that you should think about is that there's no thesis, and the capstone projects can be relatively hit or miss. 

Feel free to reply or DM me if you have more questions!",3,,False,flvj2nr,False,False,1585524901.0,2020-03-29 18:35:01

I’m a GA major with some regrets so maybe I can chime in here. At least when I graduated, it was very interdisciplinary. That felt great because I could take whatever classes I wanted, and they still counted. However, at the end, I didn’t really focus on anything. Additionally, the core classes felt like a big waste. The capstone wasn’t as structured as a traditional thesis would have been. Finally, nobody outside of Yale knows what it is, or that it’s competitive.

I still would have majored in it, but I would have thought twice about it before I leapt into it.",1,,False,flzj8d0,False,False,1585624994.0,2020-03-30 22:23:14

I was really disappointed when I got the news and honestly, questioned my decision to come to Yale. I came to Yale to study Global Affairs and it is just supremely absurd that the university was preventing me from majoring in what I wanted to major in. I was angry because I feel like I've given so much to Yale and Yale (as an institution) has simply not reciprocated (the people are great, though.

S&DS 230 with no stats background?,Ziddletwix,"The challenge is that the class is mostly focused on teaching programming in R, which students generally find fairly time consuming (unless they have significant prior programming experience in other languages, which of course helps a bit). Thus, the concern is less about it being possible to “learn the stats as you go” (I think that’s quite possible), but the added time commitment. It’s not a particularly hard class, at the start of the semester, most students spend a LOT of time figuring out programming basics, which makes it harder to find the entirely separate time to learn the underlying stats. 

To get a more authoritative answer, you’d have to hear from a student who has experienced it. (I’m speaking as a TA from a few years back, so I might not be in touch with the class difficulty). My assumption is that none of the stats material in the course is terribly challenging on its own (basically intro stuff), but I believe it would require significant time commitment to learn it on your own if you’re ALSO struggling with programming in R (the real challenge and purpose of the course).

Anyone know anything about scheduling? Very lost prefrosh,cobaltchemist,"I know that you should choose 115 over 116 for sure. Definitely more worth your time. I don’t know who you’re looking at taking it with but I’ve had several professors in the math department and if you shoot me some names I can help you out on that front. I took it with Sarah Vigliotta and she’s awesome. 

As for Chemistry, you’ll want to take the lab later in the week. There’s often some kink in the experiment that takes Monday and Tuesday, sometimes Wednesday, to work out and makes the experiments on those early days take longer or go wrong. However, Friday lab is getting harder to get as the demand for it is increasing. Thursday lab was my favorite out of all of the days. Dr. G is a pain in the fucking ass but you’re stuck with him so you might as well get used to it. Try to make a friend that has recently taken gen chem so that they can help you out with the lab reports. Otherwise you’ll be like me, heading into fall break with a C in the class (was able to bring it up so don’t worry too much). If you can work on the reports with friends, they go by a lot quicker. 

If you’re looking for a way to squeeze in premed and global affairs, I would spend next summer either getting the physics sequence or the organic chemistry sequence out of the way. I know people that did that and still did research on the side, and then maybe the next summer you could do something more geared towards your other major, study abroad, take more classes, or research full time. It seems like your interests will be taking you a lot of places, and that is very exciting, but I encourage you to be careful as you enter your first year and not stretch yourself too thin. There is a very fine balance between extreme first-year FOMO and being so busy that you don’t have time to breathe or grow in your most fundamental year of college. And don’t forget that it’s okay if you don’t have everything figured out right this second. You will soon meet lots of people that can guide you wherever it is that you’re wanting to go.

Re: your question in the OP, residential college seminars are hosted by each college and specifically have a number of seats reserved for kids in that college. So, since PC stands for Pierson College, CSPC 301 Music and Cinema: A History will have a majority of Pierson students and the rest a mixture of students from other colleges.  

Residential college seminars are usually pretty hard to get into, especially as a first-year, and require you to write a little application statement. First-year seminars, on the other hand, are specifically designed for first-years (only first-years can take them) and admission to them is pretty much random through the [preference selection system](https://yalecollege.yale.edu/academics/preregistration-applications-and-preference-selection).  

I would definitely recommend trying to take whatever seminar you get into and/or at least one completely random class! There's a lot of premed requirements, but you also have 36 credits and 8 semesters to fit them in.

-	gets into Yale 
-	sees lots of upper middle class people and some properly rich kids
-	is so shocked by what a difference that an extra $50-500k annual household income can make that she struggles to understand the questions that privileged people have time to examine
-	writes article about how good some people have it, mostly out of sheer luck of being born to richer parents
-	misses the point of what many of ideals that these “rich” kids live by
-	misses the point that going to an Ivy League or similar institution for your undergrad is that being in an incredibly pampered environment and around tons of very privileged kids, while getting taught by the some of the best professors in the world, allows a person to develop a world view that *can* be used to make life better, on average, for people, as a whole

what are the advantages of skipping classes?,TreeOfFinches,"You get acceleration credits, which aren’t really valid unless you choose to graduate early, take a gap semester, need to take a semester off, etc etc. They get used toward the graduation requirement of 36 credits.

The other advantage comes in with skipping prereqs/reqs for certain majors. This does depend on the major/program. For example, I’m an EEB (Ecology and Evolutionary Biology) major. I needed to take gen chem as a prereq, in addition to math through MATH115. Because I accelerated into orgo and MATH120, I don’t need to take gen chem, MATH112, or MATH115, and therefore I’m on track to complete my major requirements with fewer actual credits. This gives me more flexibility to take different electives, double major, get a certificate in something else, etc.

As for pre-med requirements, you’ll likely have to talk to a pre-med advisor. However, I do know that Yale writes a letter to med schools if you skip gen chem. It essentially says that, with high school experience + the placement examination, you have completed general chemistry up to Yale’s standards, which will clear that requirement for most med schools. For reference, the orgo for first years class I was in was likely majority pre-med students, so it didn’t seem to be much of an issue.

what are the advantages of skipping classes?,hitherescotty,"My previous comment on this topic in /r/yale:

""I tried to skip a level with Math when I was a freshman. It was not a good idea...

I'm not sure what your high school is like, but the caliber of student at Yale is obviously very high. You won't be the only smart kid in the class anymore.

And there are a lot of new variables that come into play when you first start college. You'll probably be going to parties and trying out new activities and possibly spending less time on scholastics than you do now.

In my opinion, you're better off staying in comfortable territory or even leveling DOWN and taking courses that will be easier for you. Honestly, I wish someone had given me this advice when I started at Yale. It would have changed my whole experience. I thought I was academically invincible and had a sort of rude awakening at the end of the first semester.

You have four years to try lots of different things - academic and extra-curricular. There's a good chance your major will change many times and your scholastic preferences will evolve. 

I realize this sounds pessimistic, but it really isn't. The most valuable things I learned at Yale were about people and interpersonal connections. You WANT to have time to explore those things, so don't force yourself into an overwhelming courseload right away. There's plenty of time for that over the next few years. 

Get ready for the best four years of your life! I'm so jealous - I wish I could do it all again :)

Tl;dr: Be conservative and don't over-exert yourself out the gate course-wise. You'll learn how much you can handle as you adapt to being at Yale. Leveling down one course is not a big deal.""

Keep in mind I last took Calc BC my junior year of high school, so I was a year removed from calc in a class full of students who took MATH115 the previous year or had already taken Multivariable Calc at some point. I still thought it was doable.

Accelerating gives you so much more flexibility. If I had taken gen chem, then orgo, I would have had two years of MWF lecture from 10:30-11:20 that eats at my day and prevents me from taking other classes during that time slot.

1. the architecture on the outside is controversial but on the inside it's beautiful.
2. lwrance, housing for old campus for stiles, is the absolute best on old campus. you'll probably be in a single, or at worst a very spacious double, and will probably have a very nice common room
3. obviously best food on campus
4. honestly, the stiles staff and incoming class of Frocos (freshman counselors—youll meet them soon) are excellent. i personally know most of the frocos for this year and theyre amazing. marc levenson and dean pitti are awesome people and are really really good at making stiles feel like a home. we have some of the strongest community on campus (and people in other colleges have backed this up as well) due to some really really amazing staff and great events (like, they spent 3000 dollars on sushi for everybody during the last finals season. i thought it wouldn't be enough but i had three full plates packed with delicious sushi—only time ive had enough sushi to be full)
5. most importantly, don't ever go into a college with the mentality of wanting to transfer out. everyone i know who's come in with that mentality has had a hard time settling in and making friends. you wont have to think about transferring at all first semester anyways. just go through with it and do as much as you can to love the college",2,,False,es9we71,False,False,1561746046.0,2019-06-28 13:20:46

Community isn’t like DPort or Pierson where a bunch of upper east side legacy kids form their cliques. Tend to be lots of diversity because I suspect Pitti pushes for it in selecting kids.

I think Berkeley is the best res college, but their facilities are lacking in comparison to Stiles. You’ll probably spend a good amount of time in Berkeley as a first-year since it’s the college closest to Old Campus, and you’ll see what I mean.

How are Pre-Med Classes at Yale,TreeOfFinches,"There are no particular “pre-med” classes — there are courses you have to take in order to be pre-med, but there are usually other students in them taking the class for various reasons.

If you’re referring solely to the STEM classes required for pre-med, so far I haven’t really struggled in them. I’m not pre-med but my major requires me to take the same classes. There’s a good amount of grade inflation in STEM classes at Yale, which doesn’t make them easier in general but definitely makes it easier to get an A.

That being said, not everyone has the same experience. I took Organic Chemistry for First Years this past year (a place for first-year STEM try-hards, LMAO) and our class size dropped from ~80 kids first semester to maybe 50/60? Not sure about that stat but the size definitely got smaller. I also know of quite a few kids who struggled in their first semester STEM classes and ultimately decided being pre-med was not their thing. 

If you struggle, don’t be afraid to reach out for help from your TAs, professors, or peer tutors. They are more than happy to help.

Not sure about policy debate -- I've never done it and don't know much about the format.

&#x200B;

I have done LD debate throughout high school and *loved* it. I think the whole structure of dissecting political issues into values measured by criteria and packaging those into clear contentions is fantastic mental training. I grumbled about the format at first but, after doing competitive Lincoln Douglas for a couple years, I think it does a great job of making one think really sharply. I also like the philosophical nature of LD in comparison to the more research-focused styles.

Physics at Yale,Rockies17,"I was a Yale Physics Major so I can definitely comment!

The Yale physics program is actually quite strong, and I think it would certainly allow you to get into any top grad program you wanted if you did well. Although I ended up working in data science, all my friends who went to grad school got into really great physics PhD programs (like Harvard and MIT). It is certainly an extremely rewarding major, but especially if you do the intensive major, it’s probably one of the more challenging programs at Yale.

As for Physics 180/181, to be completely candid with you, I didn’t know any Physics major that took that sequence, as that really is for pre-meds and probably not what you’re looking for. My pre-med suite mates took it and it seemed like a basic standard college physics course but certainly not as richly calculus based as you’d want as a major.

So if you know you want to major in Physics and have the high school background (namely Physics C), I’d highly recommend taking Physics 260/261, as it is really the intro sequence designed for Physics majors and presents some really cool topics like GR in an accessible way. The most challenging part of 260/261 may be the math as you really need Math 120 (multivariable calculus) - you can take Math 120 as a corequisite but if you’ve never seen multivariable at all it may be more challenging. (I actually took 260/261 sophomore year after having taken Math 120 freshman year and I felt that this made things relatively easier).

The other option is to take the more engineering focused 200/201 which I know a few physics majors who did and enjoyed, but I’d still recommend 260/261 as it’s really THE intro sequence for anyone who wants to major in physics and has a strong math background.",6,,False,ekurz39,False,False,1555221108.0,2019-04-14 00:51:48

Physics at Yale,fuzentrix,"Hey I'm not a physics major but am an engineering major at Yale and have plenty of friends who are physics majors here so I can comment.  To reply to your previous comment, if you've taken AP calculus through BC calculus and never any other physics, I would recommend shopping PHYS 200 and PHYS 260 when you get here and seeing which one you like better. Over the years, it seems that 260 is a better-taught course than 200, but the professors recently switched so it may be different. Ultimately, you should take Math 120 (Multivariable calculus) or Math 230 (proof-based multivariable calculus and real analysis) concurrently with your intro course. Math 230 I would only recommend if you have extensive proof-based math background and are really looking to get into the proof side of math along with your physics education. The great thing about Yale is that you have the opportunity to ""shop"" the courses (i.e. PHYS 200 and 260) at the same time up until ~2 weeks into the semester so you can see which one is better for you. I have had friends take the PHYS 180/181, 200/201, and 260/261 intro course sequence and still become physics majors, so it's not going to stop you from becoming a major no matter which sequence you take. However, from experience I think 200/201 or 260/261 are the best to prepare you for future courses in the major. I would take a look at the [Yale physics major required courses] (http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/physics/) or the [helpful page here] (https://physics.yale.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies/guide-introductory-physics-course) to see exactly what you should be taking other than the intro courses for the major.

As for your question on research/faculty and graduate school admissions, the good thing is that Yale physics is on the smaller side, so getting research experience is really easy. As an engineering major here, I've worked in two labs and co-authored six papers here during my time due to the ease of working with faculty and the fact that they treat you like graduate students if you put in enough time. The physics major also lets you do research for credit (PHYS 469/470) as first-year and sophomore as pass/fail and (PHYS 471/472) as junior and senior for letter grade, so you can do this during the semester for your major and fulfill requirements that way. For the summer, Yale has a variety of [summer research grants for undergraduates] (https://science.yalecollege.yale.edu/yale-science-engineering-research/fellowship-grants) which give you a stipend to live in New Haven and conduct research with a faculty member. They are usually approximately $4300-$4500 per summer, which is more than enough to do research and walk away with a little extra money after the summer ends. Yale has good placement in graduate school admissions because what matters for that is letters of recommendation and research experience, and faculty tend to write very good letters here since research experience is easy to get, and the labs are small enough that the faculty will get to know you very well. One example I would give you is just to go on any Yale faculty's website and look at where the ""former undergraduate students"" have gone on to graduate school, like [Prof. David DeMille's website here] (https://demillegroup.yale.edu/former-undergraduate-students), who has sent most of his former undergraduates to Harvard or Stanford PhD programs (and this is just one example of many).

Course-wise, your intro course sequence (etc. PHYS 260/261) will be accompanied by an intro laboratory course sequence for physics (PHYS 205L/206L). After your first year, you will generally take one semester advanced classical mechanics (PHYS 410), one semester electrodynamics (PHYS 430), one semester thermodynamics/statistical mechanics (PHYS 420), two semesters of quantum mechanics (PHYS 440/441), and advanced physics lab (PHYS 382L). Beyond this, you will be able to take any electives in the undergraduate or graduate school to supplement your education; popular ones include solid-state physics (PHYS 448/449), particle physics (PHYS 442), and other courses in astrophysics and graduate school of physics. Of course, you should also take more math classes such as linear algebra (MATH 222 or 225) and ordinary/partial differential equations (ENAS 194 or MATH 246 and MATH 247). Many physics majors will supplement their major with advanced proof-based math in case they want to go into physics theory graduate school.

And I've always assumed that it matters a great deal if the student body tends to be all wide eyed and oh-so-grateful that some amazing donor gave to the school, rather than upset when they disagree with the donors stances and work.

Your day will be filled with meetings and presentations that will be capped off with a nightly meeting with a group of a few suites of first years (roughly 16 people in total). If you don’t have an orientation schedule yet try googling around for one.

Nights for first years will mostly be parties in suites on old campus hosted by other first years, cultural houses, clubs/organizations hosting events on campus, etc. I’m pretty sure there are also Yale sponsored nightly events. If you are a bit more connected in terms of knowing what’s going on  -they aren’t as well advertised to first years- parties at fraternities and off campus housing.

Thoughts on Berkeley College?,Kovarian,"The system tries to build small communities for people to become a part of, but it had the effect (at least for me) of cutting me off from the school as a whole. You don’t have access to parts of other colleges for security reasons. On “family night” for dinner, you can’t eat in other colleges. Everything revolves around your college being your home and family.

But I didn’t click with my college. I was ok friends with a few people, but they weren’t my best friends. Because they all were close, I always felt like an intruder at college events. This made things like family night unbearable. I just didn’t eat those nights, or went out (and being a poor financial aid kid, that caused its own problems).

The college system as a whole ignores that people will make friends based not only on proximity, but on interests and personalities. The system forces friendship, or at least an approximation of it, on everyone. I would have loved the college system if family nights didn’t all line up (so there was always a place to have cross-college meals), if transferring was easier so I could have lived with my friends, and if it wasn’t pushed as a “everyone loves their college and it’s the most special part of what makes Yale great!” thing.

Branford College,Ziddletwix,"> Whats there to do?

So you probably won't get too many accurate answers here because most users are undergrads, and their experience of the school year is quite different than the summer. But basically it depends a lot on your age/interests. The usual social scene of the yale undergrads is obviously gone during the summer. The rest of the regular stuff (bars, concerts, etc) all exist, although some of them will get a lot more quiet during the summer. 

But the short answer is that all the regular stuff you'd expect to find in a town of New Haven's size is still basically around. But if the question is about *Yale's* social scene, the answer will just be whatever replaces it with the summer program that you'll be in. Which people here probably won't be able to answer much about, because they won't really know.

> How big is Yale's campus? 

It really depends on how you measure it. The core of campus around Branford isn't too large, the walk to any other undergraduate college is at most 10 minutes, and it's more like 3-5 for almost all of them. Similarly, *most* classrooms are in a pretty small area of 4-5 blocks or so. But there are parts of campus that extend quite far. Science hill is a bit of a trek (where many classrooms could be), and if you extend to the med campus that's much further (let alone West Campus). So it really just depends on how you measure it, but I'd say the important bit is that most of the core undergrad campus will be a 2-10 minute walk away, and you're about a 10 minute walk from downtown.",4,,False,dzs6bgy,False,False,1527623905.0,2018-05-29 14:58:25

Branford College,Ziddletwix,"Got it. I'm a grad student, so I'm around for summers, but also not always exactly in touch with on campus life. But I do know regular campus life is gone during the summer, students don't stay around, it would only be replaced by whatever summer programs are there at the time (I TF for a summer course, and they seem to have a decent social scene during that period).

> Is there like a rec center for the entire campus or just a smaller one for each college? 

Each undergrad college has its own miniature gym, that all residents would have access to (unless there's something different for your situation/the summer term). There's also a large group gym, Payne Whitney, which students would have automatic membership at (again don't know your situation). PWG has annoying hours during the summer (on weekends only 10-2), and probably isn't going to be as broad as what you'd see at a larger school, but it'll have what you'd expect from a college gym (and I probably mean more of a rec center, the weight/cardio room is just the 4th floor, it has basketball courts and pools and etc).

Besides that, because the regular students are gone, you'd probably get better information about what's going on in /r/newhaven,  because when the regular students and even most grad students are gone, the stuff going on is mostly based in the town itself. But if you have any specific questions definitely let me know, and I can let you know if it's around.

Does anyone here have celiac? How's gluten-free life at Yale?,RegulusKhan,"So I do not do gluten-free at all, but I can say what I have observed during my time there. Honestly, you shouldn't have a problem from as far as I can tell. I am not 100% sure what the exact options are but I know that there are certainly gluten free options and it honestly depends on the day on how many different options you have. Most of the colleges have salad bars in addition to certain toasters and what not that are specifically for gluten free people. The butteries might be more difficult as a lot of the food is stuff like grilled cheese and quesadillas, but I know that mine serves carrots and hummus (which I think is gluten free) so there might not be a ton of options but there are some; it just depends on which buttery you go to (I would always recommend Hopper, Davenport, or JE). There are several places you can go for food off campus that should be gluten free, so I wouldn't worry too much. I haven't noticed any social impact from it; Yale is a really diverse place so there are plenty of people who also do not eat gluten and if there is anyone who gives you a hard time for it, it is more of just them than a campus wide feeling.

Does anyone here have celiac? How's gluten-free life at Yale?,GenericUsernameHi,"Well, most important is that it's genuinely gluten-free and properly handled to avoid any and all cross-contamination, not just ""gluten friendly."" Maybe that's implicit?

I think it depends on what your market is. You're in/near Science Park, right? Someone who's spending a lot of time in the lab will probably want to be able to get either snacks or a decent meal.

As far as snacks go, cookies and muffins are always good options, and the good gluten-free versions taste exactly the same as the regular ones. You can certainly get other gluten-free pastries, but they might require a more specialized facility. Fruits and nuts are easy because they're naturally gluten-free and don't really require special preparation.

For meals and/or more substantial snacks, sandwiches and cheese/meat plates are always good bets. The sandwiches, though, might be harder to sell to the non-celiac audience, because gluten-free bread just doesn't compare to regular bread like the pastries do.

There are, of course, some other things that I would like to see as someone living with celiac, but I'm trying to keep the theme and limitations of a coffee shop in mind with my suggestions. I'll definitely keep an eye out for more good options. I'm starting in the fall and expect to spend a lot of time in Science Park, so I suppose I'll be around your shop a fair amount! It's really nice to see you're working to provide options for people with dietary restrictions. And of course, please do definitely feel free to ask me any other questions you may have.

How is premed at Yale?,orangeazn,"First congrats on the acceptance. Always a great feeling to have the weight off of your shoulders knowing you'll be going to a great school 
Premed definitely not bad at all. 
Yale definitely has a reputation of grade inflation so getting a good GPA isn't too hard. 

Just doing the premed courses is a bit time consuming (especially labs) and puts pressure on your schedule in that you basically have to take at least one pre med classs plus lab every semester. But if you end up going into a STEM major, there will be some overlap which is nice. Premed classes are all pretty introductory courses so they are definitely not as hard as upper level courses. 

Pre med is by no means the easiest path, but I would consider it relatively easy compared to other routes you could take (namely CS, ChemE). I would say you will almost always have free time, especially on weekends, to spend time doing other things. 
Also, don't sell yourself short. Getting accepted early means you are a great applicant and deserve a top spot at Yale. You'll be surprised at how much free time you'll have, and definitely take advantage of that making friends. Yale is full of some of the coolest and most interesting kids in the world, yourself included. 

And you have a ton of time to change your mind too. I'd recommend just taking one premed class, either chem or bio probably, just to test it out. If you continue to like it, great.

Question about available majors at Yale,TheRealmsOfGold,"Thanks to /u/vornska for the shoutout!

I'm a professional conductor and composer who earned his undergraduate degree at Yale (B.A. in music) and now conducts primarily choral-orchestral repertoire. (There is no undergraduate music school at Yale; undergraduates take music through the College's Music Department.) As a music major, you can specialize in any field; it won't show up on your transcript, but nobody cares about that. It will show up in your life.

I went to Yale because I wanted to study music in a liberal arts context. The singers and players in the College brought a breadth of life experience and intellectual interests to our music-making that made for better music then, and remains dear to me now. My education in music, and in conducting specifically, was a sterling one. I took three semesters of conducting with Yale's world-class faculty: two with Toshiyuki Shimada, who studied with Bernstein, and one with Jeffrey Douma, who studied with Blackstone. Toshi has a keen ability in addressing students' stumbling blocks, while still giving them latitude to get through an exercise before going back to fix things — and he made sure the entire class could learn from one student's correction. Jeff has one of the most beautiful gestures I've ever seen from a conductor, and is equally graceful in intellectual dialogue with students, encouraging them to discover the ""whys"" behind the music and behind our making it.

I can speak less to undergraduate conducting opportunities at Yale, since at the time I was focused primarily on composing, but there is an optional, auditioned Intensive track to the major which entails a senior thesis. I imagine it could be a conducting project, if it were possible to build a student ensemble for the purpose; you might email the Department Chair and ask. Of course, as Yale is rich with student activity, there are numerous amateur groups on campus that need conductors: musical theater groups, the Madrigal and Slavic Choruses, all of the Residential College orchestras, and, of course, the a cappella groups for which the university is well-known. As well, the Glee Club and the Symphony have, in the past, offered small opportunities for undergraduate assistant conductors.

If Yale speaks to you, I couldn't recommend a better place to be, to learn, and to grow. I wouldn't be half the musician I am today without my time at Yale, and the lessons I learned there continue to change my work and my life today.",2,,False,difa788,False,False,1496533026.0,2017-06-03 18:37:06

The other posts in this thread are correct: for undergraduates, Yale only offers one generalized B.A. degree in ""music"" writ large. There's a lot of freedom within that major to devote time to the things you're interested in, but the department as a whole doesn't offer a lot of classes in conducting or performance.

Question from a visiting fellow: how should I spend a weekly free hour or so?,peeingandnothingness,"- I second the two art galleries (Yale University Art Gallery on Chapel/York, and Yale Center for British Art on Chapel / High). Both are beautiful buildings by Louis Kahn. You can easily spend all of your time between these two galleries. 

- The Architecture school directly across from the Yale Art Gallery usually also has interesting exhibitions. It's also a very cool building by Paul Rudolph. During the day I think you're able to also access the architecture studios on the upper levels (floors 4 through 7) if you're interested in seeing what kind of work is going on there. 

- You won't have access to this, but try to sneak into the residential courtyards. They're all pretty amazing. 

- Stirling library also has very beautiful cloister-like courtyards and strange nooks and crannies all over the library which are worth checking out. 

- Peabody Museum of National History : i've never spent much time here but it seems very interesting

- Ingalls Rink : iconic hockey rink designed by eero saarinen

- East Rock Park : probably doesn't fit into your hour-long slot but it's a very nice park that's not so far away. if you're in east rock you should check out the pantry which is supposedly pretty good for breakfast / lunch (i've never eaten there)


Food:

- meat & co! highly recommended. on crown street, amazing sandwiches. really really good. 

- the lunchtime food carts near the Yale School of Medicine (along Cedar Ave. near York) are GREAT. my personal favorites are the korean food cart and Peking Edo. 

- barcelona : pretty good spanish food / tapas, nice ambiance

- caseus : i never went there but people rave about it. 

- zinc : nice food, nice ambiance. 

- tarry lodge : very good food

- tikkaway : basically indian chipotle but it's so good!

- BAR on crown street : nice place for a drink and/or pizza. occasionally horrible crowd though.

See if the Dura-Europos exhibit is still on display at the YAG — it's a collection of cross-cultural artifacts of immense significance, but it's not large and can be seen in an hour.

* Check out the historical recordings collection at the music library (in Sterling — down the nave, then a right and an immediate left). I think your affiliation with the university would merit you some sort of guest access; ask at the desk halfway down the nave on the right. As an alum I was granted significant access for archival research.

* Sally's Pizza is better than Pepe's in my opinion, but that's why there's a rivalry :-)

* For your nature kick in a smaller dose, Wooster Park is a great place to sit and just be. *Also then you're in position to go get pizza at Sally's.*

* Archie Moore's has the best wings in the United States.

For when you have more time:

* Attend a service in Marquand Chapel up at the Div School. They sing music that's a little more hair-raising than most, owing to their organ, which uses an antique tuning system from Bach's day!

* East Rock is worth a visit; the climb and view over New Haven is lovely on a good day.

Yale engineering,WoodenSpider,"ABET Mech E grad here. Yale Engineering is ok. Heavy into theory, little hands on experience in the classroom.  

On campus recruiting is shit. There was like 8 companies at the engineering career fair my senior year and 3 of them were for coding companies.  They sent us to columbia's fair to try to make up for it.  

Yale is looking to expand the engineering program, they are pouring lots of money into facilities and actively favoring applicants who lean towards engineering.  Problem is that they aren't willing to sacrifice anything to accommodate engineers.  They try to shove engineers into the same box as all their other majors.

There is very heavy non-major requirements (2 Writing, 2 Humanities, 2 Social Sciences, 1-3 language), which combined with the requirement that you only get 8 semesters before they kick you out makes things pretty difficult. Additionally co-ops are actively discouraged (they want you to focus on learning and exploring and bonding with classmates) and pretty much every academic advisor is a liberal arts prof/major who pretty much demand you spend freshman year year exploring non-engineering options.  End result is that Engineering is damn hard to get through, you pretty much have to bow your head and fight against the school to get your degree.  We sort of felt like second class citizens too - the university has a very obvious bent towards the liberal arts, and the student body is so weighted in that direction that it seemed like the campus would have preferred we weren't there.

Additionally Yae engineering professors, while there are a lot of them, are almost all very theoretically based.  Grants come from NSF or the DOD for basic research, so there are not many industry connections to get job placement from.

Ok so that was the bad.  Now for some good:
Yale just invested $1.2 billion in stem in the past decade and it is (finally) starting to show. The CEID (center for engineering, innovation and design) is fantastic.  Super cool free makerspace with every engineering group headquartered there.  It didn't open until halfway through my junior year - if it had been open the entire time I think I would not be nearly so negative about the engineering program.  It doesn't sound like much but really made a HUGE difference in engineering on campus - we now have a nucleus of engineering support. Before that I was leading robotics club meeting in whatever basement I could find - first year of the aerospace clube we literally were headquartered in a closet (it used to be a darkroom).
I know you're probably thinking that extracurriculars are ok but I really want to hear about the academics.  Well you are a high school student so you probably don't know what you are talking about.  Extracurriculars are key to job placement w/o personal connections, and you should take them very seriously from the start.  Something like 60% of the engineers at my current job were in the SAE formula (car racing/engineering) team in school.

Academics side - yes, pretty good teacher/student ratio.  Definitely not 1:1, thats some bullcrap you were fed (source: I was an engineering tour guide and a lot of that stuff is out of date/number fudged/purely made up) but damn good nevertheless.  Intro classes are still going to be big like everywhere else (physics was like 80 people) but the higher you get the smaller it is.  My propulsion class senior year was 5 people and it was amazing, best class I took at Yale.  Also research (paid or unpaid) is damn easy to come by. I worked for 3 years working in a chemical engineering lab developing catalysts for scramjet fuel for the air force.  And then another year working on 3d printing with metals for darpa.  Very good stuff.  It's not easy 'snap your fingers' to get that work, I spent my freshman year working in a chemistry lab scrubbing flasks before I got the chem E job, but I got paid $13/hour everywhere.  Minimum wage for yale students is $12 and subsidized by the undergrad administration, so it's not that hard to find someone who will pay you good money to build your resume and get experience.

Bottom line is it can be a fantastic if you are willing to fight for it.  ~%25 of Yale's freshman class declares engineering majors coming in, ~%5 graduate in engineering.  The weak, uncommitted ones get weeded out.  Which means you are left with only the strongest and smartest engineering personalities at a school where everyone is in the top 1% intelligence in the world.  Every single kid comes in thinking they are hot shit and reality hits them like a freight train (source: i was a residential freshman counselor (froco), Freshman all think they are God's gift to mankind until grades start rolling in). It's a struggle to stay committed when all your roommates and friends are going out every other night and staying up till 3 AM debating philosophy and playing video games (yes these often go together somehow) while you are trying to make it through another P-set.  The only classmates you have left are hyper intelligent and hyper competitive and it's all graded on a curve, so you have to work your tail off.

But if you make it through it on top you are set.  I graduated in a class of 10 ABET MechE's. I'm with SpaceX now, another one is a stanford Aerospace Masters, another is Caltech applied physics, 3 are working in Wall street/consulting/Ibanking (never remember which is whcih), 1 is in Africa doing something humanitarian-y, 1 is at microsoft, and 2 are building startups.  What I'm getting at is the lack of OCR and a career counseling office that knows anything about engineering isn't going to hold you back.  Because if you make it through you can take care of yourself. ",15,,False,cy4oxja,False,False,1450551060.0,2015-12-19 12:51:00

Does Yale have a website of course reviews by students?,connormxy,"In order to get your grades every semester, you have to review your courses (after the instructor has upload the grades, but before you can see them). This review data is then attached to every course on the system used to actually register for every course before each semester, OCS.

You have to be logged in to Yale to see this.

There are years and years of data on here and this trustworthy for course reviews is used exclusively by students. The Yale Bluebook website is just a wrapper for these data; it was a student project that was bought by Yale. CourseTable was the same, but it averaged numbers in a way the university didn't like, so it got shut down. No service has ever tried to be a new place to upload reviews, because students already upload reviews for every class, every semester, directly to Yale.

Frankly, the university needs to update the OCS interface, drastically. But honestly, there is no way that some outside course-rating service could replace it. It would have to be made by Yalies or Yale to access Yale-only data, and would have to have all the years of reviews that are already online. Further, it's already hard enough to get the reviews out of students before they can see their grades, and those reviews are literally on the page you use to register for courses.

Previous attempts at new course review apps for Yale only succeeded because they presented all the data that's already on OCS in a way that wasn't an eyesore, not because they had a better way for people upload new reviews.",2,,False,cq8kobm,False,False,1428728886.0,2015-04-11 00:08:06

I'm pretty sure you need log ins to view them all.  No one really uses OCI until registration, pretty much everyone I know use ybb/ybbplus to search for classes, read reviews, and compare classes.  YBB is good and allows all the normal searches.  Ybbplus is a excel-sheet style, where the basic info is all displayed for all classes and then you can limit whats shown based off department, type of credit, time, prof rating, work rating, etc.  It also allows you to see what your friends (via FB i think) have in their schedules.

Harkness I know nothing about except that it's home to a lot of med, nursing, and public health students.  It's near the medical campus, so if you're going to be down there for classes/research, it's well located.

Getting a room in the dorms or in the grad apartments, about which I know nothing, is difficult.  Apply early if you want it.  

Otherwise, there are two main locations: East Rock (which I basically call everything north of Trumbull Street up until Hamden) and west of York Street (Dwight, Park, and Howe Streets).

Advice for an incoming freshman,LittleToke,"Rising senior here.

I regret not doing foot or one of the other pre-orientation programs. I've only heard good things about them.

An alternative to Perspectives is STARs (Science, Technology, and Research scholars). I am currently one of the upperclassmen who runs/mentors for the program. It's geared towards minority STEM majors or STEM majors from underprivileged backgrounds (rural, inner-city, public school, etc..). STARs I is for freshman and gives you support for pursuing a STEM major, including an ever-willing-to-help mentor like myself and a group of tutors for various subjects. The program is run by some professors and deans on campus and is great for a science-oriented support. They also bring in speakers to talk about graduate school and science degrees, as well as pull professors from campus to sit down to dinner with the students and talk about research and their undergraduate experiences in general. It's gotten a lot of stellar reviews from our participants. The freshman year program does require an application and is a bit selective, but not too bad. There is also a STARs summer program, which I did the summer after my freshman year, where you get to live on campus (for free) and do real independent research with a proff (while getting paid!!). There's also STARs II for upperclassmen, but that's down the road a bit for you.

Honest impressions of your application process for Yale?,Pandaemonium,"*""the best application or resume is one that makes you stand out""*

Yeah, THIS!  Test scores are NOT enough to get you in.  Honestly, the first line of my common app essay was, ""Bam!  My name is [X], and I'm exciting enough to merit that opening.""  Then the essay was about doing things like Supermarket Hitchhiking (standing in the produce aisle with a thumb stuck out and a sign that said ""**Aisle 6 or bust!**""), and a project I called ""Operation Friends We Haven't Met"" to reach out to people in my school I didn't know but thought might be interesting (including throwing a going-away party for a kid that none of us had ever met before.)  I kind of hate how cocky I sound, but with that essay as part of my common app, I did get into every school I applied to.  My Yale-specific essay was about an online forum that I posted on.

The point of the essay is NOT to show you would be a great student - there are thousands of candidates that would make excellent students.  The point of the essay is to show that you have something to add to the culture and community of the college.  Write about your greatest passions, not your greatest accomplishments (unless those two are the same.)  You want to make the person reading your essay say to themselves, ""Wow, I'd really like to meet this person!""

And to tell you the truth, I never thought I would get into Yale.  I only applied because my brother (who went there before me) made me promise to give it a shot.  I was shocked when I got in, but once I visited and saw how amazingly passionate and diverse the students were, I made my choice almost on the spot.  So I would definitely encourage anyone to apply, you never know what might happen!",6,,False,c90b69x,False,False,1363936924.0,2013-03-22 02:22:04

1. Passionate about learning whatever it is that their interests may be

2. Capable of taking advantage of the resources offered by the school

There are also houses sprinkled in between. Depends on where you'll be working (especially of it's West Campus) and what you'll be needing, especially since I've b really only looked at this through the lens of someone who needs much shorter-term arrangements.

I will also say that people overstate the danger of New Haven... It is sometimes a nasty little city squished against some of the richest New Englandy neighborhoods, like really any city. Yale dominates its area also, literally owning most of the real estate anywhere near most of campus too.

How is it like being an undergrad in Yale?,100percenthomo,"i am a freshman here so my viewpoint might be more limited-- just a disclaimer

that being said, from what i have seen so far:

1. yes!!!
2. yes, but any college is going to be stressful in some respect, especially at elite institutions like yale. this is a big transition from high school. i came from an extremely small high school (<100 students in graduating class) so coming to yale was EXTREMELY overwhelming for me! you do have a TON of resources to help you in many aspects of your life though. there are so many advising resources for pretty much every academic subject plus writing. classes can be stressful but they don't have to be if you are good at time management and picking a balanced schedule!
3. it is extremely easy to socialize. i have noticed that a lot of people here seem to be really extroverted and friendly. sometimes if i walk into a dining hall alone i just sit next to a random person and they are more than happy to chat. the res college system and froco group system also kind of gives you automatic friends. if you do a preorientation program, you will literally go into school with a group of best friends. in terms of partying and going out, this is not a state school but it's easy enough to find a party to go to on the weekends if you are serious about wanting to get shitfaced. greek life exists and plays a role in campus social life but not a major one
4. it is competitive but it never feels cutthroat. people are always ready to lend a helping hand here and there is huge collaborative energy. there are some more competitive majors (like econ) but i don't think that's necessarily yale culture, it's just like econ/finance/etc culture
5. definitely a feeling of solidarity!",20,,False,f0ja27l,False,False,1568653221.0,2019-09-16 12:00:21
How is it like being an undergrad in Yale?,DryFish037,"1) Yes, exciting.

2) Stressful? Sometimes, but it depends on the person.

4) Everyone is at Yale because of competition but it won't feel 'competitive'. What you hear about Yale being cutthroat/competitive isn't true. At least speaking as a junior for me and the people I know.

First, I didnt want to throw myself headfirst into a class I might not be prepared for. Second, I thought going into 115 with prior knowledge would give me a deeper understanding of the content and I'd enjoy it more. But, I'm also not a math major so it doesn't matter for me.
