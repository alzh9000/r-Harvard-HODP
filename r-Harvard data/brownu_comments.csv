Read  ""[Why the US has the world's highest number of Covid-19 deaths](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/12/opinions/coronavirus-us-death-toll-trump-sachs-opinion/index.html)"".  A U.S. sailor from coronavirus-hit aircraft carrier has died after contracting virus. (I guess he is not very old so we might die too.)  So the question becomes ""how many Brown students are we ready to lose?"" (***herd immunity***) The US still lacks even a basic plan for controlling the epidemic today. Unless we are ready to die or kill each other with  SARS-CoV-2, we are not going back to school in September.  I wonder how many international students from Asia would come even if the school could reopen. It is much safer for them to stay  in their own countries.

 I would recommend that you read the [history of  The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-i/1918-flu-pandemic) (Trump would have called it ""American Flu"" since  the [first known case](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-cases-reported-in-deadly-influenza-epidemic) was reported at Camp Funston in Fort Riley, Kansas, on March 11, 1918). 

>The first wave of the 1918 pandemic occurred in the spring and was  generally mild. The sick, who experienced such typical flu symptoms as  chills, fever and fatigue, usually recovered after several days, and the  number of reported deaths was low.   
>  
>However, a second, highly  contagious wave of influenza appeared with a vengeance ***in the fall of  that same year.*** Victims died within hours or days of developing  symptoms, ***their skin turning blue and their lungs filling with fluid  that caused them to suffocate (just like Covid-19)***.

"Shot, Chaser",sophware,"What we ""*do* with that truth"" is all she cared about. Me, too.

You left out ""It won‚Äôt be easy, but there‚Äôs a path to get students back on track"" in the first comment. The subtitle wouldn't be an effective summary without it.

Then, the second comment went with this:

>Failing to re-open in the fall would have been the death knell of higher education in America.

...which still lacked the same key elements of her subtitle and the content of the op-ed.

Paxton did and would still say that opening schools without doing the right things is untenable.

Did she think all schools would do the right things and should simply open? Absolutely not. Did she think most would? Enough would? That's what I hoped and is how I read it.

If I were going to object to the shot-chaser pic, I'd focus on the following point she made:

>plans must be based on the reality that there will be upticks or resurgences in infection until a vaccine is developed, even after we succeed in flattening the curve

(That point is best associated with the first sentence of the subtitle, not the second.)

In any case, even if taking that approach, I'd talk about what success in flattening the curve means and the fact that in many schools, the way they open(ed) will possibly not result in a flattened curve but will, in fact, undo it.

Assumedly, that worry is the valid portion (however large or small) of the pic in the post.

The less valid portion is that Brown hopefully won't be like the 100 college communities in the pic. It may be on track to do well, in terms of supporting a flattened curve. Other schools, not so much.

Brown is set to do better precisely because it is not simply reopening.

It didn't have its current plan simply dictated by what Paxton knew as of her op-ed:

>The plan is based on the recommendations of multiple[ working groups](https://healthy.brown.edu/updates/planning-groups) at Brown, which since late spring have explored a range of options for safely providing teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan‚Äôs policies and protocols are founded on the best available guidance and recommendations from medical and public health professionals and agencies, Paxson said.   
>  
>([source](https://www.brown.edu/news/2020-07-07/healthy))

Ask first-year students if Brown is simply open for them in the as of the fall.

If I understand correctly, Paxton announced that they will start in the ""Spring Term,"" kicking off in late January. If so, then a number of students (about a quarter of the usual undergraduate student body) won't be there next week.

A major portion of that group won't be there in January, either. In another approach not discussed in Paxton's op-ed, many recently admitted students are being allowed to defer a year. I believe this group numbers more than a couple hundred.

Finally, it makes sense to include some good points made by Paxton that are not fully covered by the subtitle:

* Lower-income students are at particular risk if HE schools didn't/ don't open
* HE schools are key employers and a large part of the economy, important to the larger picture, beyond the welfare of students",1,,False,g4b40v4,False,False,1599460026.0,2020-09-07 01:27:06

However, I did not read her article as not prioritizing the health of the students.  She articulated a possible path forward to do it safely with concrete suggestions. There obviously has to be some balance. It cannot be that colleges don't open until a vaccine to guarantee no one gets sick as we don't know  if that will ever happen. ...
There HAS to be balance and her article prioritized health of students. 
She said:
The reopening of college and university campuses in the fall should be a national priority. Institutions should develop public health plans now that build on three basic elements of controlling the spread of infection: test, trace and separate.

Christina Paxton's opinion piece in today's NYTimes,2notarobot,"My concern when reading President Paxson's article was that she began by talking about economics - which doesn't just mean she's only interested in money, I  think she genuinely cares about education and I understand that colleges need to be solid financially to provide that - but it wasn't until the 7th paragraph down that she started talking about health. I certainly think she cares about the health of students as well, she's definitely not heartless,  it's just a question of where the balance for her lies, and I'm a bit worried that she's willing to take too many risks to open the school. I noticed that most Ivies closed before Brown did.

Class of 2024 questions?,2notarobot,"I'll answer the pieces of this that I know (as one person, with one perspective), and hopefully others will chime in.

Research opportunities at Brown are great. Lots of options, and professors are generally very eager to have undergraduate students in their labs.

A lovely thing about being premed at Brown is that I've never run into a student who isn't collaborative. Students happy to help you out, no feeling at all of being competitive.

I don't think students come to Brown because they want a good GPA for med school, I think they come because they are excited about learning. That's a big piece to consider when looking at how good of a fit the school is for you.

The various grading policies (such as no Ds, the ability to drop a class at the last minute, the s/nc option) do take the focus off of grades - but don't be deceived, classes at Brown are hard, and even just getting a satisfactory in a class takes work. 

Professors that curve classes also tend to have some firm grade boundaries above which you can be assured of a particular grade. From what I've heard, there is more grade inflation in the humanities than in STEM, but most students don't seem very grade focused. For many, it's the particular projects involved in and recommendations from professors that are going to make the difference for the next steps.",14,,False,flo3gt6,True,False,1585330916.0,2020-03-27 12:41:56
Class of 2024 questions?,acetrainerelise,"Another premed here! I think Brown is a great place to be premed. None of the major premed classes reverse-curve, and since we don‚Äôt have +/- grades, it‚Äôs easier to keep a high GPA. Off the top of my head, orgo and physio are both curved so that an 85%+ is an A, physics varies year to year but is usually an 88% I think. The average Brown MCAT score is a 515 last I heard, which is like 93rd %ile. I think our first-time med school acceptance rate is <90%, which is more than double the national average (~40% ish). 

I think research is pretty much like any big institution- email enough professors and eventually you‚Äôll find something. I‚Äôm doing linguistics research instead of bio research (med schools don‚Äôt care), and it‚Äôs suuuupperrrrr easy to find research in the CLPS department IME. 

You‚Äôll also need clinical experience and nonclinical volunteering to be competitive for med school, and there‚Äôs good opportunities for both at Brown. The Swearer Center handles most non-clinical volunteering and most programs expect 2-3 hours per week, but there are some that you can get away with just an hour per week. There‚Äôs plenty of options to choose from. For clinical hours, you could volunteer at Miriam, Hasbro, or Rhode Island Hospital (kinda boring imo, but very standard for premeds). Brown EMS is pretty competitive to join, but you could also gain clinical experience with an EMT certification at Rhode Island Free Clinic or, if you can get a car on campus (I rented a spot off an upperclassman), in a neighboring town- this is what I‚Äôm doing. You can also get paid experience as an inter-facility transport EMT. Scribing and being a Medical Assitant could also be perfectly valid options, but I haven‚Äôt looked into it much. 

My specific advice for premeds at Brown: Take CHEM0330 (gen chem 2, assuming you have AP chem credit) and BIOL0200 freshman fall! BIOL0200 is supposed to be a fairly easy bio class with lab, and the other bio classes with lab are much more time-intensive. There aren‚Äôt a lot of bio classes with lab (physio, genetics, microbio, and a few seminars), so you aren‚Äôt doing yourself any favors by skipping BIOL0200 with AP credit. You *should*, however, skip CHEM0100 and go straight to CHEM0330, as chemistry at Brown falls in a very strict sequence. I didn‚Äôt realize this as a freshman, and now I‚Äôll have to take the MCAT at the same time I‚Äôm taking biochem if I want to avoid a gap year after college. While I had technically allotted myself enough semesters to take orgo 1, orgo 2, and biochem, I didn‚Äôt realize that orgo 1 and biochem are only offered in the spring semester, while orgo 2 is only offered in the fall.

Class of 2024 questions?,fightme4315,"I can give another premed perspective! You got a great answer to classes and grades, but my take on things, and to answer your other questions:

Grades: Getting good grades is hard work but do-able. Some people are better at some classes (for example, I had a fairly easy time with Biochem but struggled with Orgo), but most classes are structured so that if you put in the work, you'll be able to achieve a good grade. This doesn't guarantee you an A, but usually, grade cut-offs are generous.

MCAT Preparedness: most of the required classes for premed (Orgo, Gen Chem, Biochem, Physio etc.) at Brown will do really well to prepare you for the MCAT. I self-studied for about a month to refresh my memory and then was able to take the MCAT and do well. Brown also partners with Kaplan to get you a discount on the Kaplan MCAT Prep course, if self-studying isn't your favorite. 

Research Opportunities: There are a huge amount of research opportunities at Brown. I got involved in a lab at the beginning of my sophomore year and have stayed there, but I know people who have tried out a few different labs or have done research for a while and then dropped it.

Unless you have some sort of special need, housing for first years is almost always in doubles. Residential life asks you a very small number of questions (like how neat or messy you are and what time you like to go to sleep/wake up) and then matches you with someone. If you want a substance free hall or a quiet hall, you are pretty much assured of this. (BTW, quiet doesn't mean asocial.) Aside from this, the matching feels pretty random. 

As far as classes are concerned, I'd say that being able to choose all of your classes is amazing, because you pretty much don't have to take anything you don't want to take. That can be overwhelming too, because there are so many choices. Some recommendations I have are to spend some time with the course catalogue (Courses at Brown website) ahead of time, look at the Critical Review, and ask upper level students about classes (at some point, you'll be assigned a Meiklejohn advisor to help you out). If you know what you might want to concentrate in, look at those requirements, but otherwise, just browse through the huge catalogue and see what appeals. It might feel a little unsettling to go into fall semester without a set plan of what you are going to take, but shopping period is great for being able to see what a course is really about. Some courses are hard to get into as a first year student, but there are many options.

I'm not sure if you would consider this a norm, but the main thing I've found about Brown students is that they are all really passionate about something. They are excited to talk about what they are into, and they are also excited to hear about what you are into.

I am still a freshman who just moved out of my dorm to switch to a different one on campus. I lived in Metcalf Hall and it was amazing. In Metcalf (as well as its sibling Miller Hall) each floor has a water fountain, two main bathrooms and 1 private bathroom. The hall is mostly doubles with maybe 3 triples max and 1 single generally at the end of the hall. There is 1 RPL (upperclassperson) who lives in another single and pretty much helps you get adjusted. Every floor in every dorm has an RPL in Freshman year. 

Anyways, I lucked out and got one of the best freshman dorm assignments but to be honest all dorms are really nice. Coming into Brown you should know that office hours are super useful but might seem a bit strange coming from high school where your relationship with your teacher might be a little less friendly.

If you are premed or pre-law or interested in a specific graduate school degree, you might keep an eye on their requirements.

Some classes are harder to get into than others, particularly for first and second year students, so you generally have even more choice in junior and senior years.

Class of 2024 questions?,acetrainerelise,"Dining is lowkey one of the most confusing things at Brown imo. 

There are two meal plans, 20/week or Flex460. The general advice is that you should choose the Flex plan unless you're a student-athlete who eats 3 meals a day, but honestly, even as a student-athlete I much prefer the Flex plan. The 20/week plan strictly rations you to 3 meal credits per day, 6 days a week (you only get 2 meal credits per day on the 7th). You can't use 4 credits on one day and 2 credits the next if you choose the 20/week plan, but you would be able to on the Flex460 plan. However, with the Flex460 plan, you'll only have enough credits to eat roughly 2 meals per day. Regardless of which plan you choose, you're allowed to use no more than 2 credits within an hour. 

There's also the issue of points vs. credits. The 20/week plan gives you more credits, while the Flex460 gives you more points. Credits can be used all the time at Andrews (north campus), the V-dub (north campus), and the Ratty (central/south campus). Credits can only be used after 5 pm or on weekends at the Blue Room (central campus) and after 6 pm at the Ivy Room (central/south campus, beneath the Ratty). You can use only points at the Ivy Room and Blue Room before their ""dinner times"", and they'll also take points during dinner . Jo's (south campus) is only open between 6pm and 2 am, and it takes credits and points the whole time. Andrews (also open until 2 am) also takes credits and points the whole time. 

For weekday breakfast and lunch, you have the option of Andrews, the V-Dub, and the Ratty using credits. You could also go to the Blue Room using points. The Ivy Room is open for lunch only using credits. All dining halls are open for weekday dinner. The V-dub is closed on weekends, and the Blue Room closes at 5pm on weekends. The Ivy Room is only open for dinner on weeknights (closed on Friday night, open on Sunday night). 

Under normal circumstances, I would tell you to look at dining.brown.edu to get a better sense of the hours and what's offered, but everything is closed now!

People's opinions of the food varies greatly. I think Brown has good dinner options both in terms of taste and health, but I personally struggle a lot with lunch. In my opinion, lunch options at Brown taste good OR are good for you, but it's rare to find a lunch that both tastes good and is healthy. The Ratty and the V-Dub both have salad bars that are pretty well-stocked, but it's easy to get sick of salad. The Ratty always has grilled chicken available, but it's also the dryest chicken I've ever tasted. The less healthy options, however, are usually pretty good.",7,,False,flrmbzq,False,False,1585423169.0,2020-03-28 14:19:29
Class of 2024 questions?,2notarobot,"First year students are required to be on a full meal plan, and sophomore students need to be on at least a partial meal plan. This policy has been somewhat controversial, but the idea behind it was to make sure students in these years have food security. Also, it means that first and second year students all eat at one of just a handful of places, which works out well for having meals with friends. 

There are two dining halls (the VW and the Ratty) where you can swipe your card and eat all you want. There are various other places on campus where you ""pay"" (usually with a credit or with points) per item. First year students have two options for their meal plan which are a bit complicated, but basically one is better if you want to  mainly go to the all-you-can eat places 3 times per day, and one is better if you would prefer to get items at the other places through the day. If you don't have financial aid, the meal plan is pretty expensive, but you won't go hungry (I never seem to use all of my credits or points).

I think the food is fairly good. I like that there are lots of options, and I think the school caters well to a variety of diets and tastes (like there are always lots of choices for vegetarians).

Having a top quality undergrad education means Brown undergrads are highly competitive when applying for well-paying jobs.

Why is Brown CS salary after graduation so high?,stooftheoof,"The data comes from [here, at the US Dept of Education.](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?217156-Brown-University) The definition is:

>The median annual earnings of former students  one year after graduation. **Only data from students who received federal  financial aid is included in the calculation.**  
>  
>These data are  based on school-reported information about students' program of  completion. The U.S. Department of Education Department cannot fully  confirm the completeness of these reported data for this school.

I think in other discussions, people have pointed out that the discrepancy with other top schools might have more to do with how many people are getting federal financial aid.  So it might have more to do with the sample or the sample size than actual, across-the-board earnings.

Here's a quote from [a discussion on this topic](https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/2164299-colleges-with-highest-new-grad-median-earnings-by-major.html) at College Confidential:

>What is missing is the number graduating. According to Brown, in 2018  they awarded 248 BSs in CS. Since it started from 48 in 2010, we can  figure that there are no more than 800 CS graduates of Brown who are  more than a year after graduation. ABout 17% of Brown students are on  Pell grants. However, in 2012 it was 14%, and in 2008, it was 12%. So  perhaps 15% of all Brown CS graduates received federal support. So that  median represents maybe 120 students, and, considering the rate of  response to these questionnaires, we're talking MAYBE 50 graduates, more  likely closer to 30. So that median is meaningless.

The discussion quoted above also states that numbers from other universities like UPenn and Harvard are similarly too low to be representative.

Here's [another site](https://www.ivyachievement.com/computer-science-rankings/) with a lot of information about salaries. It  has Brown's median starting salary for CS as $84,600.

I'm no expert, but these are things I've seen in other Reddit posts or web searches that seem to confirm my suspicion that most Brown CS graduates won't be starting with $141K salaries.",2,,False,fzlc26w,False,False,1595999030.0,2020-07-29 00:03:50

"Does anyone else think these ""election support"" emails are really embarrassing for us?",aitchrjay,"I think you've got your finger on the right pulse here, but I do think there's something to be said for this outreach. I haven't gotten quite the volume of mail that you have, so I can't speak to the tone or content nearly as much, but I'll offer my perspective on the general sentiment - I've been approaching these last couple days as a grieving period. The vision of the future that a lot of people at this school have took a *serious* hit on Tuesday, and a lot of those people need time - and support - to process it. That's why I'm ultimately okay with these kinds of initiatives; if, like the two of us, you aren't as viscerally affected and don't have a need for them, awesome, delete it, go on with your life. If you do need a place to go vent, talk some shit, cry a little, be with people who are in the same pain neighborhood as you, they're a valuable resource.

Where I think we agree is how we should generally approach going forward. You're absolutely right that we cannot foster an echo chamber here and expect to be taken seriously both in the world and by some portion of the student body. When the time for grieving is up, the time for moving on - in this instance, (for us Dems) asking ourselves how Trump got elected and what our role in making sure it doesn't happen again is - has to begin, or else you can't help but wallow in your anger and lash out at its objects. I think a good portion of why Trump was able to even be taken seriously is *massive* backlash against elitism, and as students at an Ivy League university, we're elites whether we like it or not. Therefore, we have a responsibility to start taking the people who elected Trump seriously, and to do that, we have to be willing to engage with them and not wall ourselves off behind our righteous indignation.",13,,1478826740.0,d9v5mm9,False,False,1478824508.0,2016-11-10 18:35:08

I'll be heartbroken if they undo gay marriage, Roe vs Wade, and the ACA (the last is at least a little bit debateable in my mind) to name a few things. I'm still shocked that he won. But saying it's a *grieving period* is kind of melodramatic and is promoting exactly what I think we should be trying to avoid; I really don't think this is something that ""support"" should be provided for. 

There are things that are easy to say, like the support thing for example. How can providing support be anything but kind? But as I said before, it can do damage too. I wasn't bothered by the actual inconvenience of the emails, it's what they represent. 

Just to be clear, I'm not saying there *couldn't* be a legitimate circumstance when this would be reasonable. When Hitler rose to power (sorry bout the Godwin's law :/ ), reasonable people in Germany definitely had reason to need support, and by no means were they being soft.

But I really think we're nowhere near that, and it can have a feedback effect. That is, acquiescing to unreasonable responses can legitimize and amplify them. 

It's funny you say that in the last paragraph, because it's actually almost exactly what Sam Harris was saying in his last podcast, where he actually called Brown (and Yale) out by name! As much as I like him though, I disagreed with a few things he said there. My personal suspicion is that a backlash against elitism/accusations of racism is a much smaller effect that probably didn't bother as many people as he thinks it did, and his real trump card (wololoooo) was a much more nebulous promise to a return to an idyllic time a lot of people have built up in their minds (as is pretty neatly captured in ""MAGA"", for example). Also, I think it's kind of shitty of him to (however briefly) mock gender neutral pronouns.

It would be analogous to a scenario where I feared all Muslims because I'm afraid they might do something violent in the name of their religion. If I wanted support for *that*, it would clearly be unreasonable, right? It's nonetheless worrying that more people weren't overtly *against* it, but I don't think his proposal itself actually merits this.

>The path forward is through empathy. If you don't need support, offer it, someone else does.

My point in all of this is that empathy is not as straightforward and always good as you're making it out to be. Overapplied, it can do damage. You don't need to look far to find examples of this in several colleges around the country.

Just to be clear, in a way we are on the same page. I want people to feel good and I want to help them too. But we're essentially arguing about the effectiveness of different methods. ",8,,False,d9vft82,True,False,1478839115.0,2016-11-10 22:38:35

"Does anyone else think these ""election support"" emails are really embarrassing for us?",aitchrjay,"Have you ever looked at content coming out of \pol\? I'd be curious to what you think about it - my contention that elitism had a serious effect on Trump's appeal is being drawn mainly from stuff I've seen from there, e.g. ""the media didn't want it, the parties didn't want it, etc...but the people wanted it, and the people won."" Perhaps it skews harder towards the youth, if college campuses are getting as toxic as I gather you think they are.

I'd like to focus on why you think support is unmerited here, and specifically what you mean by it. Are you more concerned that the support is coming from the college? Or do you think the student community needs to take this as a wake-up call and stop supporting each other in the name of discourse? 

As to the first option, the email I got from Paxson was pretty careful to stay nonpartisan, although the ""The election has raised concerns about race relations in this country, issues of respect for gender and identity, and issues pertaining to immigration"" part is pretty pointed. I'd be curious to see other emails you might have gotten that I don't currently have access to, but judging from this one it looks like the administration's official stance is much like the one I outlined, and I agree with it. Their capacity as university administration actually gives them a responsibility, I would argue, to provide avenues of support at this time, since -

The simple fact is, this election has the impact of a high-profile hate crime. Trump has disparaged females and the female-bodied on multiple occasions, has proposed one measure that smacks of Japanese internment in WWII (Muslim deportation) and a second that recalls the Berlin Wall (the Wall). As policies, these latter deserve to be taken seriously and their merits debated (I think they hold up rather poorly, but still). As sentiments, together with his attitude towards women, they are a slap in the face of broad swaths of the American people, and his election magnifies that slap by the power of half the country. Trump hasn't committed a hate crime, but he has catalyzed the creation of an environment that feels all of a sudden much less safe for pretty much anyone who isn't a white male, and it's nationwide. The distinction between the election of Trump and the election of Hitler is quite fuzzy to me after reviewing [his platform](http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/25points.htm)
- Trump hasn't trafficked in the kind of explicit racial nationalism Hitler did (as far as I'm aware, he's chosen to focus on *illegal* immigrants as demonizing targets) but he *has* called for the (albeit temporary) expulsion of a large group of people based on religious background which, as with Judaism, is correlated heavily with ethnic status. While it's true that Hitler's stances was unilaterally more hard-line than Trump's, there's enough resemblance here to make me nervous.

Whether or not you think the community's general reaction is justified, it's there, and in spades. Telling people to suck it up, or ignoring it altogether, isn't going to be effective. If you find grieving to be too melodramatic a term, try thinking of it like the response to a massive setback as one is on the cusp of a goal. It's shocking, and immensely frustrating, and while there is a type of person that redoubles their efforts immediately, there is also a type that needs to take some time to let that shock and frustration out, metabolize it, and *then* figure out what's next.

If you meant support in the second sense, that the community needs to wake up and put on a strong, discursive front, I'd say that would be forcing everyone to be the first type of person. Rather than ""acquiescing to unreasonable responses,"" I think allowing the second type of person to be who they are is a highly reasonable course of action that will build goodwill in the long run. I'd also say that when trafficking in emotions, as these responses are, there is no reason, and there is no reasonable. There's just what you feel, and you can't control that. You can manage how it manifests, as well you must in discourse, but at certain extreme levels, which Trump is particularly adept at provoking, it becomes impossible to do so, rendering discourse pointless. I'll reiterate, in the long run, I think it's more productive to have this venting period, for this reason as well as the ones I've already outlined.

I'd say, yes and no. What he said is most definitely *important* and indicative of how he thinks, but the worry for it also needs to be weighed against the probability of it actually happening. Both the Muslim ban and the deportation of all illegal immigrants are, from everything I've read, pipe dreams (/nightmares). Also, correct me if I'm wrong here, but from what I remember and a couple of sources I just checked (WaPo/LAtimes), his ""ban"" involved Muslims *entering* the country, not a deportation of people already here. If so, then even if he got his insane plan (if he even wants that; there's a good chance he doesn't), it wouldn't involve sending students home in the middle of their degree, right?

I have to disagree with the rape culture thing. As horrendous as the stuff he said was, I think saying it has to have emboldened rape culture is putting things in black and white (never productive) and essentially insulting a large part of the electorate, which is arguably what got us into this damned mess in the first place. It's basically assuming that people can't vote for him, yet think he has really shitty views on certain things. Yes, there are myriad clips of truly terrible people at his rallies saying things like ""blacks should be thankful for slavery"", for example. Those assholes exist, but I'm guessing their opinions aren't getting much worse anyway. But saying that any significant percentage of people will think that his behavior (which was largely denounced by people on *both* sides) is now okay because they see him on the throne is treating people like children.

Just to be clear, because I'm not trying to put words in your mouth but I also want my position to be clear, I don't think people shouldn't talk about this. I've been talking about it with my friends pretty constantly recently. But I don't think the *school* should be offering the place to talk about it, with the pretty clear implication that it's a negative outcome.

>Is it elitist to want to pursue the american dream through an american education, or to want to feel safe, physically?

Saying this is a bit of a straw man, because I never said pursuing the dream/etc is elitist. Of course it isn't. My point here is that I think actions like this are actually *watering down* an American education, and hurting the dream thing you're talking about. College used to be (from what people have said; I wasn't there so I guess it could just be a fake narrative people push, but it sounds reasonable) a place where your ideas were challenged, not echoed.

"Does anyone else think these ""election support"" emails are really embarrassing for us?",Ultralightream,"I'd say that these things range from somewhat worrying to outright alarmist or not based on fact.

The mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is really, really unlikely to happen. [Here's](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/us/politics/donald-trump-immigration.html?_r=0) the NYT saying so, [here's WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/09/what-it-will-take-for-president-trump-to-deport-millions-and-build-the-wall/) (I supposed you could make the argument that everyone was saying that him getting elected was never going to happen, and here we are, but I think that logic is getting overapplied and could obviously be applied to anything, so it's not really evidence). Besides, we're talking about Brown students: are there even any undocumented immigrants here?

The part about black people is reaaaally vague. Which federal policy are you talking about? Stop and frisk? While the numbers seem to mostly indicate that any positive effects from it are coincidental (it therefore being bad no matter what), it was hardly violent. Is there something specific you mean?

I tried to find examples of what you might be talking about, but they're still very vague and *not* based on federal policy. [Al jazeera](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/black-americans-fear-racism-police-violence-post-trump-161111113721530.html) says that his win might embolden racists to be violent, and [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/11/trump-election-black-lives-matter-police-brutality) says similarly, but neither actually mention any ""federal policy will promote and encourage violent, lawless police practices while ignoring violence against them"". While it's *definitely* worrying that it could inspire violence in the general population (also, to be fair, mostly speculation), do you have any actual examples of federal policy?

I mentioned the sexual assault thing in another post so I won't say too much about it now, but I think that logical progression is tenuous at best. [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_sexual_misconduct_allegations) has about the same level (as much as you can compare it with this metric) of sexual predation as DJT. Obviously it's awful with both, and ideally our president has *none* of this bullshit, but I think it's really going out on a limb to say that it will encourage a nation.

>...and who knows, perhaps deported as well

That's kind of my main point here. There most definitely *are* some worrying things, but you can't just say ""who knows"", because at that point you're basically vaguely speculating/fearmongering. Remember how people were saying that Obama wants to ""take our guns"" and there would be ""death panels"" as a result of the ACA? I think you and I are actually mostly on the same page in terms of what we want (all the things you said most certainly sound terrifying to me), but I think being alarmist and not factually correct hurts our cause.",5,,False,d9xhtdr,True,False,1478979598.0,2016-11-12 13:39:58

"Does anyone else think these ""election support"" emails are really embarrassing for us?",footnote4,"On the merits: you're response is that deportations are unlikely? Yeah. Nothing unlikely has happened this year, especially relating to Trump. His nomination and election weren't unlikely, were they? Well, at least he'd need congressional authorization to carry out mass deportations. Oh wait no, he can do that unilaterally. Telling immigrants whom Trump had promised hundreds of times over a year and a half to deport that they're wrong to panic because their deportation is ""unlikely"" is glib and gross. You're saying that immigrants have little to fear because a man who unexpectedly came to power largely on the promise to deport millions and has awesome means at his disposal to unilaterally carry out that threat probably won't do it. How little does one have to value their lives to say such an awful thing?

Also, are there undocumented students at Brown? Yeah, in fact. A bunch. Learn more about that. Also, some Brown students care about the wellbeing of undocumented persons beyond the physical confines of campus. 

One consequential difference between Bill Clinton and Trump is that Bill Clinton was ashamed of and hid his sexual predation; Trump has spent his life boasting about (and doing it). That makes a big difference in how it is normalized. If you search the news, you'll see signs of normalized misogyny. Again, telling a woman that she's being unreasonable to panic because there isn't ""enough"" evidence yet of misogyny's normalization is bad. 

A similar point can be made about a president who is openly racist, and once called for the execution of five black kids *after they were found innocent.* Trump has also attacked Black Lives Matter as threats and promised support for police departments against protesters. That's terrifying. To tell a black person that they're wrong to be scared because Trump may not follow through reflects a low valuation of their safely.

Depressed about coming back,Nazi_Dr_Leo_Spaceman,"Sorry you're dealing with this. First year can be really difficult, and the way you feel is totally valid and understandable. I didn't really have any friends in my first semester either, and it was really rough. I absolutely had depression, and eventually had a nervous breakdown too. Its important that you know you are not the only person at Brown going through this - lots of people do, and you are not alone. What eventually worked for me was just joining a couple different clubs (worth noting its definitely not too late to join, lots of people join clubs in their second semester) and forcing myself to go until I formed some connections. Eventually I met some people I shared things in common with and formed friendships. It might not work for you, but it might be worth a shot. Lots of people on campus are super friendly and willing to work at forming friendship, so even if its not something that's easy for you (i know it isn't/wasn't for me), just try and put yourself in situations where people might approach you.

Regarding your roommate, I have two recommendations. First, if your roommate is actually causing you problems, talk to a Student Support Dean. They are super understanding and will, if nothing else, provide some great advice for dealing with what's going on. If its necessary they will do everything they can to find you a single or some other roommate to move into. Second, don't feel like your missing out on anything by having a shitty roommate. Plenty of people don't befriend their roommates, and it ultimately doesn't matter because there are plenty of chances for Sophomores to get singles.

Finally, regarding academics, again, just don't be afraid to explore academically. Utilize the open curriculum, if you don't find anything you will always have time to finish a moneymaking degree in your last two years. I had no idea what I wanted to do during my first year and didn't find my passion until late in Sophomore year. Try and find out about interesting classes that might show you the best different subjects have to offer (feel free to PM me, or feel free to do things like post on the FB groups looking for advice). Also, don't be afraid to talk to a dean or even just a random Professor. They will all be happy to help you learn about different subjects and the things you might want to do. 

Again, sorry you're having a rough time. A lot of people go through depression at Brown, so you are not alone. If needed, don't be afraid to set up a meeting with CAPS to talk about things, they are free to students and happy to help. Hope some of this is helpful, and hope things get better for you.

Here‚Äôs the thing. There certainly are students with bad home lives and circumstances who advocate for this policy for the right reasons. There‚Äôs absolutely no way that the number of students who that applies for is even remotely close to 2500. Other than a few vehement supporters, I suspect most people in favour just don‚Äôt want to do work.

If it is the case that grad schools/companies are as understanding as you claim they are, it‚Äôs a simple matter to just add an addendum to any application. 

This UFli and privileged argument represents the worst part of Brown where every bit of discourse has to tie back into some terminal impact onto the most marginalized communities. You realize that you don‚Äôt have to be privileged to support having a choice in grading right? There are certainly UFli and other unprivileged students who do not support universal pass.

What do you guys think about the trimesters idea?,US_Govt_Is_Corrupt,"Dear Current and New Brown Students:

I hope you are all doing well as you finish the semester or, in the case of members of our new Class of 2024, complete high school. Everyone at Brown is eager to see you on College Hill.

To our graduating seniors, congratulations on being so close to getting your degrees! I am looking forward to the Virtual Degree Conferral ceremony on May 24. None of us expected that we would be apart for this important moment marking your achievements at Brown, but we already are planning ahead for the time we can be together again to cheer on the Class of 2020 for the celebration of Commencement.

While I hoped that the state of the pandemic would allow us to celebrate in October, we have made the decision to host a double Commencement in May 2021, for the Classes of 2020 and 2021. Based on the latest health information and expert guidance, we think it is likely that large gatherings still will not be possible early in the fall. Our graduating seniors will have the opportunity to celebrate their Commencement and their first Reunion at the same time.

Planning for the Fall Resumption of Classes

As national conversations continue about the uncertain trajectory of the novel coronavirus pandemic, and what it means for colleges like Brown that offer residential experiences, I want to provide an update on planning for the reopening of the Brown campus. As I have shared previously, Brown‚Äôs plans are based on two foundational principles: (1) first and foremost, to protect the health of our students and employees to the best extent possible, and (2) to provide all of our students with an excellent academic experience.

The mode of how we deliver the educational experience at Brown next year may very likely look different than in past years, but I want to provide the assurance that how we conduct the year will be based on the best expert advice for safeguarding the health of our community and maintaining Brown‚Äôs high standards of teaching and learning.

We are planning for a range of different scenarios for the coming year, including variations of the following:

A scenario in which we are able to follow our normal academic calendar, welcoming all students back to campus in the fall. (We know that this is optimistic, and it‚Äôs largely dependent on the progress in testing and treatment I have noted below.)

A scenario in which the University offers three semesters of instruction next year and arranges for undergraduate students to be on campus for two of these semesters, thus providing an environment with  fewer students on campus at any one time.

A scenario in which health conditions are such that the fall semester has to be conducted remotely, with a decision about the spring to be made in the middle of the fall semester.

There could be various modifications under any on-campus scenario ‚Äî reduction in class sizes, hybrid online and in-person learning with livestreamed lectures and smaller group discussion sessions, etc. ‚Äî depending on containment of the novel coronavirus. In addition, even for an on-campus scenario, we‚Äôre planning for delivering education remotely for students who are unable to return to campus because of travel restrictions or health conditions.

I plan to make a decision about Brown‚Äôs planned approach no later than July 15. There will be decisions about various academic programs that we have to make sooner, based on factors that include ongoing limitations to international travel (affecting study abroad, for instance), and program schedules that require early decisions for on-campus activities that usually take place during the late summer. These decisions will be announced as they are made.

I understand that many of you are eager to know what next year will bring, and I would like nothing better than to give you definitive information sooner. However, there is still so much we don‚Äôt know about the course of the pandemic. In the coming months, we will learn how health conditions evolve as the U.S. economy begins to reopen, and how quickly innovations in testing, contact tracing and treatment occur. By waiting, we will be able to weigh these factors to make a better and more fully informed decision, which is in the best interest of the health of our community. I appreciate your patience.

On Sunday, May 17, we will send new and continuing students a survey to get your thoughts about the choices you would most likely make under each of the scenarios currently under consideration. This confidential survey will be used solely to guide and refine our plans. Your answers will not commit you to making future choices.

I strongly encourage you to take the survey. Your input is essential for helping us plan for an academic year that best meets the interests of Brown students. Following the conclusion of the survey, we will host virtual town halls for continuing and new students to share updates on planning. More details will be shared in the coming weeks.

I want nothing more than to see all of you in person and on campus, as soon as is safely possible. Although the course of the pandemic is beyond our control, we are working as hard as we can to make that a reality. In the meantime, I hope that you and your loved ones stay healthy and well in the weeks and months ahead.

Sincerely,

Christina H. Paxson

I too was considering transferring to a state school where my friends were, and that's a totally valid choice if that's what it comes to. But Brown is a really great place with a lot of unique and great opportunities, and it's not a choice one should make lightly. What I can recommend is trying to find clubs and organizations where you can be at home and form some deep connections. Also, in terms of work, just make sure you practice self care. There's a really bad culture in CS that glorifies not sleeping, etc, but don't buy into it. If your having trouble with the class, talk to advisors and do your best, but it's not worth ruining your time in college. I'm not a CS concentrator so I can't speak too much about CS15, but in general I've found that every semester classes get less and less stressful. I'd be happy to talk in more detail if you want to PM me,  but in general I really hope things improve for you, and just know your not alone.

I know it feels like it's been ages, but you've only been here for six weeks. I felt the same way. I was so lonely the first couple months of my freshman year. It seemed like everyone was falling right into friend groups, and I was on the outside. The reality is, everyone's still figuring it out. Although it seems like people have super solid friend groups, most people still feel super insecure, just like you do. Friendship is super performative this first semester, and things look much different from the outside. People probably see your performative self and think the same things you're thinking. Just know that everyone eventually finds their place, and try to take some comfort in the fact that you're doing everything you can. As long as you keep reaching out, keep going to social outings, eventually you'll find a group. It took me a while, too.

As for the roommate, I feel you. I'm really introverted, and not having a space to myself drove me fucking nuts. Take some walks by yourself, try heading down to the river or into downtown Providence. Learn your roommate's schedule. Take long showers. You'll find enough time.

I know it's really tempting to transfer, but try to hang in there. Things will get easier. You can always transfer later if you need to. And of course, if you need anything, feel free to DM me. :)

If anxiety is playing a big role in this then I think that seeing a therapist is a very good option. I was super depressed in high school and I think I would still be if it wasn't for therapy ‚Äì it doesn't work for everyone, but it's helped me a lot.

It sounds like you are actually doing a pretty good job going out and being social; I empathize with feeling like you are always the one reaching out, but sometimes that's just the dynamic that's set up and kudos for still doing it even if it feels awkward. I'd say if you just keep meeting new people, whether at parties or clubs or whatnot, and are real with people - eventually you will find you recognize more people at the dining hall or around campus, feel more at home, and over time develop deeper friendships with some of them.",3,,False,e7x7d93,False,False,1539758999.0,2018-10-17 01:49:59

Depressed freshman,JustinML99,"Hey there. 

I was in a very similar place last year (I‚Äôm a sophomore now). [I even made a post about it here.](https://reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/73i77t/im_at_an_amazing_school_far_from_home_but_am/) Like others said, it will get better. However, at the same time, you can‚Äôt just wait for it to get better on its own‚Äî as hard as it is (and I know it‚Äôs **unimaginably** difficult sometimes), if you think you want to even try to stay at Brown, you need to try to make some true friends. It took me several months to find real friends and even today, I only have a handful. But it really does make all the difference. 

I‚Äôm also going to say that although it will **almost certainly** get better, that does not mean that by this time next year you will love Brown. I still think about transferring to my home city‚Äôs school, even as of just a couple weeks ago. I still miss my hometown and my high school friends. Some people love being away from home and independent, but to others (like me and probably yourself), it‚Äôs a trade off we choose to make because Brown is an amazing school. 

What I would recommend is to stay the whole year and then evaluate how you feel. If you‚Äôre dreading coming back here over summer and would truly rather be at the university with your friend and nearer your family, you deserve to do that. Don‚Äôt spend more than 1 year out of the 4 you have being miserable. 

Try to make it better here. But know that if it doesn‚Äôt work out, doing what you need to do for your mental health is the top priority. Definitely don‚Äôt try to stay here just because Brown is a great school. It is, and **you‚Äôre amazing just for getting in,** but it‚Äôs not worth feeling constantly depressed for. 

Read the two articles/guides in the top comment on my post which I linked above. They were helpful and let me see my situation from a more objective point of view. Also know that your advisor and CAPS are used to and (in the latter case) trained to talk about these things with no judgement, and are there for you to use in these situations.

College students are rebelling against full tuition after classes move online,aber1,"I'm not sure how I feel about this. Not saying I agree or disagree, but just not sure. 

By this same logic, doesn't it follow that the schools could decide to pay their faculty (or other employees) less, because the online teaching experience doesn't provide as much value as in-person? Obviously that would be cruel.

Obv a super rich school with a huge endowment like Harvard is going to be fine regardless, but in general, I hope that universities will continue to pay their employees, and in order to do that, many of them probably need to maintain their income from tuition. Plus, endowments are often restricted. Or is that not the case? I'd be curious to see the operating costs & budgets for some different private universities. 

Maybe a more nuanced approach is that universities should offer to re-evaluate all financial aid claims and eligibilities (like immediately, rather than at the beginning of the next academic year), given that many families have experienced major financial upsets that might make them eligible for more need-based aid.

College students are rebelling against full tuition after classes move online,mhb,"Here's my view. Brown is a business. In exchange for money they provide an educational experience. Supermarkets are businesses which provide groceries. Any confusion about how to expect colleges to act is a result of believing that there is some fundamental difference between a college and a supermarket.

Businesses generally cultivate customer loyalty. One way is with loyalty cards. Another is by engendering a sense of community. How would you react if a supermarket asked you to keep paying for groceries even though they were no longer able to deliver them? It could argue that we're all in this together and that they have to pay their lease and would like to pay all their employees and pay for spoiled food. You would be sympathetic, but would you think it was reasonable to keep giving them money?

Someone loses here. Either Brown or the students who are not getting what they've paid for. Discussion about Brown's expenses, financial aid etc. is as beside the point as the details of cashier wages and refrigeration costs are in deciding whether to keep giving money to a supermarket for no groceries.

If you consider this, you would see that the true violators of feminism and basic human rights is not Ryan, but those who use false rape accusations for personal benefits. Additionally, I would also like to remind you that if you intend to get your opinions across in a mature manner for serious consideration, childish insults and unnecessary language makes you sound entirely unfit for intelligent debate. If you cared so much about presenting your ideas in order to benefit society, you would state them in a way that would make people take you seriously.

2006 Brown University rape scandal exposed,rffleming,"Alright defensiblespace, let's take a little look. 


""The male is a domestic animal which, if treated with firmness...can be trained to do most things."" -- Jilly Cooper, SCUM (Society For Cutting Up Men, started by Valerie Solanas)

""If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males."" --Mary Daly, former Professor at Boston College, 2001.

""All men are rapists and that's all they are"" -- Marilyn French, Authoress; (later, advisoress to Al Gore's Presidential Campaign.)

""The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race."" -- Sally Miller Gearhart, in The Future - If There Is One - Is Female.

""I feel that 'man-hating' is an honorable and viable political act, that the oppressed have a right to class-hatred against the class that is oppressing them."" -- Robin Morgan, Ms. Magazine Editor.

Lordy I could go on put I dare you to find that hate on /r/mensrights. 

Ok so no logical fallacy since it's back up with facts. We're learning here.

Your first link only mentioned 1 comment from mensrights, and even then it was just a report, so ok that's useless.

And FBI lists it as a resource, not an end all be all. 

Ok, so now moving on to address your profanity. Do I facilitate misogyny. Hmmm that's one hell of a coincidence. But for your information I was raised by a single mother (who gave me the world and everything she could while working low wage jobs barely scraping by), have 2 wonderful sister that were both abandoned along with me by an abusive father. The large percentage of my friends are female, much to the chagrin of my girlfriend (another absolutely wonderful human being who is better than me in every way), and I have never ever ever assumed that a woman was less than a man. In fact my nature would point to the opposite. Ok so there we have that out of the way. 

Maybe, just maybe the reason I wrote that was to get the word out that Brown was bought and sold by some alumni donor who had Ruth Simmons on strings attached to his fingers. Maybe I wrote it because I'm a poor student on full financial aid that is at the mercy of people like Richard Dresdale when I shouldn't be. 

But no, no you can't see that, all you can see is some stereotype you made for me. What because I POSTED ONE LINK on a subreddit that had one or two idiots out of 36,000 post something stupid. Defensiblespace I will not insult you like you did to me, I will not slander your name. Instead I will wish you to be informed. I will wish you to think before you hurt people. Maybe just maybe if you and people like Marcella Dresdale acted this way this story would never have been an issue.

Given that personal agency is a principle exemplified in the open curriculum and Brown in general, this is a disappointing attempt at a solution.

The spring break meal plan at no extra cost is nice, though. Of course, there's no free lunch, and I'm sure the price of the meal plan will change accordingly in one way or another - if not immediately, then a year or two down the line. Still, I think this one is a net positive.",28,,False,eoluwb3,False,False,1558676713.0,2019-05-24 00:45:13
"Second-year students now required to be on meal plan, separate spring break meal plan to be eliminated",mint-ish,"This is so upsetting. Not only is meal plan so, so overpriced, cooking is also a way of relaxing, bonding, and remembering my home, culture, and family for me. Yeah sure we can get the lowest meal plan and then still grocery shop and cook, but you get the fewest swipes/points for what you pay for, as we all know... and it‚Äôs still so expensive. 

I went off meal plan last year (sophomore) and it was one of the best decisions for my financial and mental situation. Obv not for everyone but at least let 20 year olds choose for themselves. 

Just some numbers:
Highest meal plan is 5.5k, and mid tier plan isn‚Äôt enough for me. Last year I spent around 3.5k total making food AND eating out a few times a week. Next year I‚Äôm trying to be smarter and will have a kitchen so only trying to spend ~280/month, which is about 2.2k total, if we say there are around 8 school months a year. I know others can buy food for ~200/month (1.6k total). They better sure as hell get us that financial aid money IF they push this through. 

And I‚Äôm not gonna discuss the quality/taste of cafeteria here but sometimes I just want asian food. Like the kind my mom makes at home, what I grew up eating. I‚Äôd prefer to eat that all of the time over any cafeteria food. And again, cooking is soothing for me and a way I de-stress. And anyways, it‚Äôs cheaper for me.

"I (still) work for ResLife, AMA!",piratedeathmatch,"1. Not as far as I know. I think 315 is super sought after for people with dust allergies so maybe it was just a bad year. 

2. This was stated in the ProJo Granoff article. Personally I hadn‚Äôt heard about it, but I did know that students who got their parents to call generally got faster attention ‚Äî mainly because parents who are willing to call Reslife for their 20 year old children can be pretty angry and entitled. After the article came out, I was actually debating quitting because I was really mad, but Reslife pays my bills and helps me make money for groceries so I couldn‚Äôt. I think, like most injustices, we just have to keep talking about it. Don‚Äôt let the news die down and be swept under the rug. 

3. Most front-facing positions care. I can‚Äôt speak for upper management, but I know my boss got really upset the other day because she just couldn‚Äôt do anything for some students who called in regards to SEAS problems. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm a mother, I wanna make all these students happy, I just can‚Äôt.‚Äù) Reslife is overall overworked and understaffed, so a lot of employees are super jaded. Some things are also out of our control ‚Äî we just enforce the rules, either ResCouncil or Brown or the city of Providence makes them. 

I agree that we can 100% do better, because I know this office can suck ass. But hopefully that‚Äôs some insight. 

4. Mainly because it costs so much money to renovate I think. If we wanted to add an elevator to one dorm, it would literally cost $1 million. But agree that dorms are shitty. I think it‚Äôs just not high on people‚Äôs to-do lists to make them better. Melissa Flowers, the new director, did express to me during her hiring process that she‚Äôd like to fix things up.

"I (still) work for ResLife, AMA!",piratedeathmatch,"Even numbers are the best. Here‚Äôs why: when you fill your spots during the housing lottery, you must completely fill a room‚Äôs vacancies.

A group of 8 is fine if you want 4 doubles, but there‚Äôs always the chance you might not be right next to each other in the dorm you want, or even in the same dorm. 

For example, say you‚Äôre a group of 6. Four people take up two doubles in Littlefield, but now there are no more rooms in Littlefield. So Person 5 and 6 have to be placed in New Pem 2 instead. The group is split up and that sucks. ",3,,False,ei8n5q2,True,False,1552259774.0,2019-03-10 18:16:14

I've basically been told that there's no guarantee that there even will be an off-campus appeal process this year, but don't quote me on that, that's just what I'm supposed to say on the phone. If it does happen, it's usually like a google form you fill out with your information and any extenuating circumstances, which is then reviewed by a reslife member (used to be Kate Tompkins before she left) and approved/not approved.

"I (still) work for ResLife, AMA!",piratedeathmatch,"Ok, story time: It's two summers ago, I'm working nearly full-time at the ResLife front desk for the Summer@Brown kids (always a mess). We're a little more relaxed, because it's summer, and because it's nice outside and usually the only people calling are incoming freshman or high school kids' parents.

A woman comes in with a white FedEx box, says she's this kid's aunt, and the package needs to get to her nephew by Thursday (it's Monday). She only has his name, no phone number or dorm or anything. I ask [what's in the box](https://media.giphy.com/media/EiPIuOdr1S372/giphy.gif). 

She says it's her father's ashes, wishes us a good day, and leaves.

~~apparently he's going to Spain to scatter the ashes but that's not fun for the story~~

So I'm freaking out. We're between supervisors, and I don't know what the fuck to do with the kid's grandfather's ashes in a fucking bag in a FedEx box on the front desk. I put a sticky note on it that says ""Do not touch, human remains"", because I don't know what to do. The number we find for the kid online isn't working, and because he's a high school kid and therefore a minor, it's really hard to contact him. On Wednesday morning I start to freakout. I somehow get his classlist and I'm about to just show up to his bio class with his grandfather, when my supervisor finally finds his mother's number.

I call her, tell her that we've been trying to get her son a package (I don't mention it's a dead guy) and she says, and I quote: ""Yeah, he's kind of a fucking idiot"".

I still remember pieces of my Brown experience as moments of pure joy - taking a class in the room on the top floor of Sayles Hall, where the floorboards creak and wind rattles the enormous windows; going to a story slam in the garden of the President's House, where people from every group at Brown crowded onto the grass and sat in trees in order to hear some deeply personal and some absolutely hilarious stories; studying (but mostly not studying) with friends at Coffee Exchange; sledding down the middle of Thayer Street after a massive blizzard shut down the city; throwing a frisbee on the main green on one of those first warm days of spring... obviously I could go on, there are so many great things about Brown, and you get to experience all of them! Two things I would recommend: 1) *use* the open curriculum!

R.I. universities suspending study abroad programs in Europe - News - providencejournal.com,LeaBasili,"PROVIDENCE - Several colleges and universities are suspending study abroad programs in Europe in the wake of the outbreak of coronavirus there.

Brown University is suspending its study abroad program in Bologna, Italy.

Last Friday, Brown spokesman Brian Clark received guidance from the CDC and the U.S. State Department that the health risk had been raised to a higher level.

About 45 students are enrolled in the program, based at the University of Bologna. Only six of those students are from Brown, Clark said.

‚ÄúBy the end of the week, all of our students will have left,‚Äù Clark said. ‚ÄúThey have multiple options. They can continue in the program remotely. Some may choose to withdraw from the program.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are not, however, returning to campus,‚Äù he said.

Salve Regina University has canceled a short-term study abroad program that was scheduled to take place in Austria during spring break. Students will be able to take the course despite the cancellation, the university said.

Salve also strongly recommended that all six of its students studying in Italy return home as soon as possible. They are studying in Rome and Florence.

Salve said it is working with its partners abroad to ensure that students are able to complete the program remotely.

The Rhode Island School of Design has also suspended the remainder of its study abroad program in Rome last week ahead of the heightened travel advisory posted by the CDC..

‚ÄúOur students didn‚Äôt travel to any of the areas in which the Covid-19 was reported and none have exhibited any symptoms,‚Äù RISD said.

The college has asked students to follow guidelines for ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù a CDC-recommended behavior for persons who have traveled to affected areas but who are asymptomatic.

This includes limiting public activities and not attending public events.",4,,False,fjib3cs,False,False,1583363868.0,2020-03-04 17:17:48

I guarantee you are not the only one who feels this way because I‚Äôm having the same issue. Just recently, I realized that it‚Äôs kinda my fault. I‚Äôm shy, but I definitely could have done more to reach out to people. Problem is, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve had this realization too late.

Also‚ÄîI happen to be a transfer student. Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt encourage you to transfer out just because of this. You might end up being very disappointed. Transferring is very disruptive.

Based on my experiences at my old school, I believe that it is just very hard to make friends at Brown (compared to other schools). Because I was just as shy at my old schools, but I had many friends.

Freshman with no friends,Void-Eater,"Recent 2018 graduate here. 

tl;dr - Think like a pokemon trainer, that Suicune is there but so are 1,000,000 zubats 

As far as those folks who are giving you the cold shoulder, let them go. If someone doesn't want to hang you have to respect that choice, even if it hurts. Not to mention they sound like jerks to me considering how they're treating, but I've never met them so who am I to say. 

Try a variety of clubs (especially the weird ones) or social events and participate frequently. It's all about increasing interactions. Go for quality, not quantity. 

After four years I can say I had 5 real friends, the kind you make time four and who make time for you.  The kind you can open up too and who will open up to you. I'm an introvert but I've got a good mask, so most people consider me social. I realized then that the kind of people I liked also wore these masks. 

To spot them, I would strike up a normal simplistic conversation and after a little while, I would slip in a comment or joke that reflected my real personality. If you get a laugh/smile then you've got a new buddy. Otherwise, they're just being polite.

&#x200B;

I recommend the Quidditch team, the  Sober Club, or the D&D club, because they have a good mix of people.

P.S. - I also recommend trying to make a start-up, it's tough but Brown offers a lot of resources.

Am I an idiot for wanting to transfer to Brown?,wlfgngpck,"Are you an idiot?  Not at all.  I‚Äôm in my 30s and to this day still have what if regrets about Harvard so I completely understand really wanting to push for a transfer to Brown if that‚Äôs where you truly want to go.

But that all said, I do think I agree with your parents on this.  The fundamental purpose of going to college is to get an education.  It sounds from your post like this is already happening at your current school and that you are in fact bonding with your instructors who are all willing to spend extra time to invest in you.  You‚Äôll certainly find that at Brown too if you reach out.  But is it really worth going back to square one at this point?

Also, and this is extremely important for you to understand, there are a LOT of stupid students at Brown.  I only have the assessment you provided in your initial posting but if that‚Äôs all 100% true, you‚Äôll likely still be on the higher end of your classes at Brown also.  You‚Äôll certainly not be put on a pedestal by students at Brown because many of them have pretty big egos (having themselves been among the best students in their respective classes most of their lives) so that will at least be taken care of I guess, but on the flip side of everyone has that kind of attitude it becomes much harder to get legitimate recognition for achievements.  So keep that in mind.

Now this is not to say Brown is horrible.  Far from it, there are a lot of great people that go to school there and a lot of great professors (some of whom I still keep in touch with).  But you need to understand that Brown isn‚Äôt this magical world where everyone eats sunshine and shits rainbows.  It‚Äôs a school with its own culture, and it‚Äôs own strengths and weaknesses.  You need to take a good hard look at what those strengths and weaknesses are relative to the strengths and weaknesses of your current school, and really see if making the transition is worth all the costs.",32,,False,flc6n1j,False,False,1585021285.0,2020-03-23 22:41:25

Am I an idiot for wanting to transfer to Brown?,ApprehensiveWillow,"graduate without debt. you sound like you'll be in a great position to go to med school, brown is fun, but you definitely seem to be putting it on a pedastal. many people, if not most, use the open curriculum to either fill their schedule with easy As or only do their narrow interests. As open as it is, you still only get 4ish classes a semester so there isn't as much flexibility as you might be imagining. and there are plenty of students who are just stupid here, just as there are many who are very smart.

in a small elite school like brown, you just don't get the same kind of diversity as exists at other schools. there are people from all over the world and all different backgrounds and superficial identity markers, but i felt during my time at brown that there wasn't much class diversity at all and most students came out of different rich suburbs all over the US and the world. Values and life experiences were often relatively homogenous. There are exceptional and different people at brown, but that felt like the exception and not the rule to me. There area a lot of social benefits of a bigger school with more class and lifestyle variation. 

If you're serious about med school and things are pretty good for you at your school, I wouldn't transfer. It seems like you have a really great path forward at your school, and I wouldn't mess with that.",3,,False,fle09s7,False,False,1585075156.0,2020-03-24 13:39:16

I understand it might be easy for me to make the judgement when I'm not in the midst of it, all emotions included, but in my opinion, I'd absolutely not transfer if I were in your place.

A list of 30 silly questions from an ED admit,burningham17,"I am a few years out of Brown so my answers may not even be relevant any more, but I will try to answer to the best of my ability because I respect the consolidation.


1. Are rooms opened with physical keys or key cards?
**Dorms are opened with key cards, but rooms are opened with keys.**
1. Are the dorms cold? My mom is worried I‚Äôm going to be cold.
**If anything the dorms run hot during the winter. You have limited temp control. Not something I would worry about.**
1. Do students at Brown ever visit other Ivy League schools? For like parties or anything?
**Not really unless you have friends there. Otherwise people do not tend to visit other campuses.**
1. Does anyone else find the sweatshirts in the gift shop uncomfortable? I couldn‚Äôt find one that I liked. Is there a better way to get merch? Do students sometimes wear Brown merchandise?
**Eh, they're fine. People do wear the merch and it mostly comes from the bookstore. I like my brown sweatpants I bought one commencement.**
1. How is Brown‚Äôs prelaw advisory? What year do students typically join?
**Do not know, but I know my friends who went into law are doing very well.**
1. Is there a startup culture around Brown in Providence? Is there funding for start ups? My friend who really wants to go to MIT always talks about how they‚Äôll fund your start up if it looks really promising (I think you have to win a competition)
**Not to the same extent as MIT or Stanford, but I'm sure you can find it if you make an effort. However, the funding will not be as free.**
1. Are there board game groups on campus? I assume there almost has to be. Any board game shops near Brown?
**You for sure can find people to play board games with. A newish store opened up near Wickendeen Street and it is pretty dope.**
1. Do you have any advice for building a first year schedule?
**Try to take a variety of classes and an FYS if you can. However, do be mindful of a potential concentration in case you need some pre-reqs out of the way (like I made sure to take Chem0330 in the fall). Take advantage of shopping period.**
1. I saw a post here about continuing to take a foreign language in college. I actually loved the open curriculum so much partially because I hate language learning. Maybe I‚Äôd change my mind later but I barely made it through high school Spanish. Is this really necessary?
**I didn't take a language at Brown except for a semester of Danish while studying abroad.**
1. Do you guys love tropical cafe smoothies as much as I do? Their peanut butter shake is amazing.
**Don't know what this is.**
1. Does laundryview.com still work? It seems like a really cool idea. Any idea if a student made it?
**Don't know if its still up, but it was cool.**
1. I sometimes wish I knew about awards that my high school gave out sooner. There were a few awards that I probably could‚Äôve gotten if I had known they existed. Are there notable awards that students strive for? Stuff that I‚Äôll miss out on if I don‚Äôt know about it? I realize this might not be in the brown spirit but I‚Äôd like to at least know about all my opportunities.
**I do not know of much beyond honors societies.**
1. Any idea how I can best slide into an RPL position? Like, how do they decide who gets the role? It‚Äôs something I think I might want to do.
**I do not think they are super competitive, but I do not know.**
1. What is the most fun or convenient work study? Anything I should maybe consider that I wouldn‚Äôt have normally?
**BUDS is the biggest I believe, but I do not know if it is the most fun.**
1. On my tour I was told that there are people that hand out hot chocolate and lemonade on campus. How can I do this?
**Is this referring to SPEC? They're a cool group that run events on campus.**
1. Any idea what, if anything, is replacing Bluno? I really like Bluno...
**Bluno sucks.**
1. Is it difficult to get into the improv groups on campus? I‚Äôve always wanted to try improv. Is it taken really seriously, or is it something I could just pop in and do every once in awhile?
**They definitely range in how serious they are and what kind of improv they do (short vs long form, for example). Some of them are quite competitive.**
1. Is the ham radio club active? This one‚Äôs a long shot, doubt anyone here is in it.
**No clue. Can always try to start it back up again.**
1. Any advice on how to get a TA role ? I love to teach and I‚Äôm considering being a professor someday, and I know I want to TA if given the chance, maybe in my junior year or something.
**Really just comes down to building a relationship with a given professor and then asking. Different classes have different TA needs.**
1. Have any of you requested to see your application and the notes that the AOs made? Is this possible at Brown?
**I was just wondering about this! I would love to see it if possible, but I do not know of anyone doing it.**
1. Are there any funny Brown websites? My friend who goes to Yale told me about the website there that tells them if the lunch is serving chicken tendies or not, even though they only serve them on Thursdays (so the website is basically: is it Thursday?). Does brown have anything similar? I hope so...
**There are some facebook groups. Current students will have a better idea of what is around nowadays.**
1. Does Brown Rank? My girlfriend is in college and her school ranks them, not just in the department but out of the whole class. I think I learned that there is no valedictorian, but is there any rank at all?
**No. Brown doesn't even give you an official GPA.**
1. How difficult is it to get articles published into the Brown Political Review? Is this something a lot of students try to do? How difficult is it to work on it (editing for example)?
**Don't know.**
1. I am interested in concentrating in philosophy, and, while this may change, I was wondering if the department helped undergraduates to get published at all. I know this is rare and difficult but I was wondering if it is done. Any idea if there is a push for undergraduates to get published in journals? Or any way to get help if I am looking to?
**Don't know.**
1. Are the libraries/gym open 24/7?
**The Rock closes at 2am on weekdays and 10pm on weekends, but the basement of the SciLi is open 24/7. I only ever went to the SciLi for all nighters. The main gym closes midnight Mon-Thur and 9 or 10pm on the weekends.**
1. Can I have a small fridge in my room?
**Sure, plenty of people do.**
1. Do people hang out on the green a lot? Like just laying in the grass? I only got to tour in the summer and I didn‚Äôt see much of this.
**Yeah for sure. Especially during the first couple of weeks of Spring. On all the greens.**
1. Can you ever have a car on campus? I‚Äôm definitely thinking that you can‚Äôt but it‚Äôs worth asking.
**You can have a car at some point, but most people do not. Parking is a hassle and Providence is a small city. Also all Brown students get free RIPTA.**
1. Is birding club as awesome and simple as it sounds? Also, anyone here do the Petey Greene program?
**Whatever floats your boat.**
1. Are there any Brown traditions that I don‚Äôt know about? Like rubbing the foot of the statue at Yale, or complete silence during finals week at HMC, or something like that. I know about the not entering the gates except for the first time. I‚Äôve also heard of this thing called the naked donut run from this subreddit? Lol. Anything else I should know about?

A list of 30 silly questions from an ED admit,andydh96,"Responding to just a few of these that I had experience with to add to the first comment:

3) Likewise to what the previous comment said, you only really visit other Ivies if you have friends there and choose to visit them. I was involved in a couple of club sports and we traveled to other campuses to compete with their teams, so if you want an excuse to visit other Ivies, a good bet would be to get involved in club sports, or if you aren't a sports type, find a club that travels to other campuses to either compete or collaborate etc.

4) The sweatshirt I bought from the bookstore during ADOCH (Brown's version of admitted students day) has been my favorite go-to sweatshirt for the last 5 years. 

6) I worked lots on a startup that Brown students created. In our specific experience, Brown didn't fund us and didn't really do a whole lot to help us get further established, which was a pretty big disappointment to us. Other Brown startups might have had a different experience, but for us they didn't support us. Brown helped put together a couple forums of students from Brown startups to meet with each other and discuss what they were doing, but outside of that the school didn't seem to be particularly encouraging or supportive of on-campus startups. 

8) Definitely depends on what you're planning on concentrate in. If you don't have an idea of what you want to study, start broadly in your first semester and try to find what interests you. Most concentrations are able to be completed in less than 4 years so it's OK to not get started on requirements immediately, but some have many more requirements so its important to get started on those early if you know that's what you want to study. 

14) As mentioned, Brown Dining Service is the largest source of on-campus jobs for students. I got paid from the start-up I worked for so I cannot attest to the BUDS experience, but my friends who worked with them basically did because they had to, they never really seemed to enjoy it much. I'd also recommend finding a paid job in the department you choose to study in; I worked a couple years in a biomed lab which was very cool and worthwhile, I learned a lot of relevant skills and got paid a good amount more than what BUDS pays.

21) I'm not sure of funny websites, but in regards to seeing what menus the dining halls have, there is a website that has this: ([https://dining.brown.edu/](https://dining.brown.edu/)) and browsing through it just now I see there's a way to subscribe to get daily menus sent to your email, which is pretty cool and I highly recommend. After eating dining hall food for a while, you'll learn of dishes that you like more than others, so it's nice to see in advance which dining halls will have your favorites and when. 

23) If this is something you want to do, get involved early. Publications like to get first years involved, and that way come junior and senior year, you are right at the head of the line for editor/leadership positions. This can extend to just about any club, but I feel like this pertains particularly to campus publications.

28) You can rent Brown parking spaces (they are pretty pricey), so most people don't have cars. During junior/senior year when you're able to live off campus, if your house has parking spaces then it's significantly easier (and way cheaper) to have a car on campus, so I'd recommend holding off until you decide to live off-campus (if you decide to do so)

30) Rubbing the foot is Harvard lol. Naked donut run is fun, Spring Weekend is also fun. During my first year, my friends liked to go to sports games in big groups which was also fun, but that didn't last longer than first semester. Nothing else really comes to mind but that's not to say Brown never has fun things to do on campus, because there are always things to do with your friend group.

The question that I would pose to anybody (edit: anybody who considers themselves to be moderate or conservative politically) concerned about Brown's political atmosphere is, 'are you comfortable being different?' If yes, you should be fine here. If no, I'd recommend second thoughts.

He chose Rice over Brown because the FA difference was over 50K per year. I would have done the same if I were to receive a full merit scholarship from Rice. You receive full tuition scholarships from both schools (free education). The only real cost is room and board. If your family can't  support your room and board without going into debt, basically they won't be able to send you to a state school without going into debt. UT-Austin's in-state COA is more than 20K per year. It won't cost you 20K to attend Brown with your tuition scholarship. As others have pointed out, Brown's students are much more diverse than Rice's in terms of majors/concentrations, which is a big plus if you are serious about being a premed.

Dphi- super invite only. Starts with a (relatively) sober dinner followed by lots of heavy drinking pregame/party events. Final event is an interview- be prepared for some difficult and weird questions. Can really only get on the list if you know a bro well.

Sigma- first event is open followed by a bunch of invite only. Lots of just drinking in house type events (ie pong tournament) with cuts after every event. Final event is a bowling thing where you have to bring  a date.  While the first event is technically open, it isn‚Äôt exactly publicized so ask around.

Thete- pretty secretive and also kind of hard to get on list. Lots of drinking type events also. More casual rush because most rushes are auto-bid (from certain sports teams)

Phi psi- super secretive due to their underground status, but once you‚Äôre on the list it‚Äôs actually pretty open. Most events are just hanging around at their house (with one or two parties also) with lots of drinking and weed.

Beta Rho- pretty public initially but gets more secretive as rush goes on. Lots of drinking events also but a few sober as well. Big room to room rush party.

How to succeed in frat rush at brown,Bruno1771,"Rush is definitely a ton of fun- would highly recommend!

&#x200B;

1- I would say maybe a little during rush and pledging, as they can be time consuming, but once you're in a frat I don't think so. You can be as involved (or as not involved) as you want if you're busy with school/extracurriculars, and people in frats still definitely take academics seriously.

&#x200B;

2. Depends on the frat. There are a few places where you might feel out of place not drinking (doing drugs is definitely way more optional), as nearly everyone else will be and events may center around alcohol. I don't think it would actually impact your chances of getting a bid (as long as you can still have fun and be social without alcohol), but there are frats where you might just feel uncomfortable if you don't drink.

What do you guys think will happen when the majority of students return?,greasyelbows,"I'm on campus now and people aren't breaking the rules and they only had a super small number of positive cases upon our arrival. It's also very easy for them to enforce the restrictions phase 1 (stay in res halls) if they wanted to. Like, they could just move around the security guards they already have around some academic buildings. I don't know how rulebreaking will change when we're allowed ""essential movement"" or when our quiet period is over. We are required to get tested twice a week. There is plenty of space for their plan to work out well (it's really only 2 months) and it's truly not difficult at all to follow the rules. Do I think this healthiness on campus could continue if the population is multiplied by 5-10? Probably. Do I think it will? Idk if I think people will actually just follow all the points of the agreement and only safely see other Brown students for two whole months (gasp). 

I get the vibe that most people don't think Brown's going to bring students back even though the two conditions (covid cases decreasing in RI and us early movers testing very negative) are being met. I'm not sure what I think exactly but I probably agree with them just because all the other schools had wildly misbehaving students. It's really only Sept 20 - Nov 20 that people would need to follow rules for as they'll be home the rest of the time. Or two weeks more than that if they stay for Thxgiving and finals. Off campus students are a whole other problem, IDK what happens with them because a ""stay in residence halls""/quarantine can't be enforced. If things go south I'm assuming they'll push us back phases until we get back to ""quarantine in residence halls"". I personally like this phase a lot and am optimistic that they wouldn't need an evacuation but could just do this as students now have to sign something agreeing to do it. But these are all just my subjective opinions, lol.

TLDR: IMO Brown's plan could absolutely work if students commit to somewhat behaving for two months. If they don't, the school will likely put us back in the ""stay in residence halls"" phase as it is easy to enforce. General opinion though is that they're not letting the rest of the students back at all.",6,,False,g4g96ki,False,False,1599580425.0,2020-09-08 10:53:45

I think money should ultimately be the deciding factor here/consideration of if that debt is manageable for you/with your intended field of study. I also think you should reach out to transfer students at these different schools to hear directly from people whose situation you will shortly be in. Brown is great, but to be frank I think it‚Äôs generally much harder to adjust as an upperclassmen here without really actively pursuing that social life. Brown can be a bit cliquey in my opinion if you haven‚Äôt started here as a freshman. That‚Äôs not to say you can‚Äôt find the perfect group for you ‚Äî but I wonder if it may be an easier transition elsewhere 

Even in consideration of what would be your transfer class, it‚Äôs kind of an open secret that  many of the students you‚Äôre transferring in with will be students who really weren‚Äôt concerned about the non-need blind option for transfer students. I‚Äôve noticed over the years Brown seems to just fill open spots by easiest means possible, meaning they tend to do this by getting more privileged students who don‚Äôt really have an issue with the price tag. 

Only things to be aware of‚Äî I found a great community in my time there but as someone who is coming in as a junior, I just worry that you may just find the transition to be much easier elsewhere.

&#x200B;

Go for everything. Do not be shy. Everyone wants to make friends and make the most out of their college experiences. 

Get involved! Pick a club you will sure enjoy do not sign up for all of the ones that you like, it will backfire. 

BUT REMEMBER, take time for yourself. You do not need to go out every day... 

Specific to BROWN

\*First and Foremost, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SHOPPING PERIOD AND THE CRITICAL REVIEW. These two are vital to determining your success/life first semester lol. I did not do either and let me tell you that I suffered. (Maybe that was just me being carefree)

\*take classes and shop what you think you might like during the first semester. Do not plan to take 4 concentration requirements during your first semester. You'll have time to get to those. 

\*Use the S/NC option wisely... 

\*Eat!! Dining hall food can be dangerously disgusting. there is a wholefoods 15 min walking distance and a couple of other markets nearby. 

\*Use resources available to you! The deans, CAPS, RPLs, MPCs, WPCs... and your meiks!!! 

\*Step out of PVD every now and then. Take a bus to NYC. Ride the commuter train to Boston!

As a senior especially, I understand the animosity towards the Brown administration right now, but the whole COVID situation has been unpredictable and changing significantly. Not trying to sound like a shill, but sometimes being a leader isn‚Äôt about being rah rah and rallying the community, it‚Äôs about making decisions you know will be immensely unpopular at the time, because in the end they‚Äôre the right decisions to make. Absolutely no one wanted to see students kicked out of the dorms yesterday, especially UFli and international students. But Brown is doing what it can to financially support students‚Äô relocation plans (including $150 automatically to every student on financial aid, which is enough to buy a plane ticket to anywhere in the continental US with how cheap flights are rn) and the reality is that we have no idea what the health impact would have been had everyone been able to stay until the 22nd as originally planned",40,,False,fktxpun,False,False,1584537503.0,2020-03-18 08:18:23

They would have been contageous for a couple days before getting sick, so all of their classmates would have been exposed.  If Brown had waited another 5 days for people to go home the those that patient zero infected would be shedding virus.   Dorms are basically terrestrial cruise ships...

I'm sorry Brown's response wasn't IDEAL, but students on financial aid got $150 for the trouble (I know Harvard kids got $500, just look at their endowment, maybe u shld have went to Harvard... oh wait) , classes were cancelled BEFORE a massive outbreak, students were able to return home BEFORE a Providence quarantine.

Major crisis in deciding where to attend (X-post /r/Applyingtocollege),suikunkun,"I'm in a bit of a rush so I can't say too much right now, but I can tell you that the Brown Band is full of lovely people and tries really hard to be welcoming to new members. having played in it, I can tell you firsthand that there's definitely a strong sense of community there. and as for comedy, every football game involves its own ""script"" which basically trashes the enemy team and stuff - so if you're looking to apply comedy skills, that's definitely an opportunity. 

as for the atmosphere of Brown, I can at least attest to the fact that it's not a competitive sort of place. I'm studying music and math - in all the math classes I've taken, for example, people are eager to work and study together, and I like to say ""we don't suffer against each other - we suffer together."" and usually when people are stressed, it's not because of competition; it's more because of their own standards. 

I know it's hard to make this choice. I won't lie - it's a very important one. but please don't worry too much about making the wrong choice once you've committed to somewhere. I'm sure that wherever you go you'll find happiness.

Major crisis in deciding where to attend (X-post /r/Applyingtocollege),brownthrowaway222,"Wow, there's a lot here. First of all I'm happy you had a good time at ADOCH and are giving Brown consideration. Congrats! 
I've given tours of Brown in the past and have gotten the Columbia vs. Brown question in the past. I've always thought of the two as the most different of the Ivies, yet many people end up in your situation every year. Obviously I don't know anything more than what you wrote here so I can't tell you where to go, but here are my thoughts:

1.) Yik Yak is a dumpster fire and you shouldn't base this decision on the shit people post anonymously there. I know people from my high school who love Columbia, have made great friends there, and have embraced life there, so I think it's best to just ignore the dumb ""jokes"" and comments people make about prefrosh (side note: I've heard a couple here and there at Brown too).

2.) One thing I didn't see you mention is size and student body composition, specifically undergrad/grad ratio. A quick google search gave me Columbia: (6k ugrad):(20k grad) students. Meanwhile, Brown: (6.5k ugrad):(3k grad) students. This is a substantial difference, and to sum it up, Brown is primarily an undergraduate focused institution. The thing we say on the tours is ""We have the size and feel a liberal arts college, but have the resources of a larger university"". I can't 100% confirm the resources part, but you will definitely get close attention from Professors, so long as you make a little bit of effort to seek it out (e.g. go to office hours once or twice). I have a sense that some of ""bureaucracy"" you described at Columbia stems from the fact that there's just a lot of grad students there, and grad school is really more like a job than college.

3.) People in all Ivies (and all colleges I'd imagine) talk and ""humble brag"" about jobs and internships. At Brown our grading system (A/B/C/NC and you can take any course Pass/Fail) is great at reducing competition. I can speak personally that impostor syndrome does exist here, I've had to deal with it myself, but I've found that the people I've made friends with in and out of my classes have always been willing to lend a hand, and haven't looked down on me for asking a question (i'm in physics btw). 

4.) Providence, specifically East Providence where Brown is, is great, but it's no New York, so it's very hard to draw comparisons. I'll say that it's certainly easy to get a job in New York after Brown, if living there is a thing you want to do, but it's more likely you won't make your way to RI if you start out in NYC. Food for thought.

5.) You got the right advice in that Brown Applied Math is stronger and has better teaching in general than Pure maths. But again, if you're not dead set on pure math, then having the APMA department right there (and a pretty great CS department too) is nice. Columbia math I'm sure is fabulous though, so I'd say you can't go wrong. If you wanna do undergrad math research, I know there are opportunities for you to get involved in that here.

6.) You were able to write out in several paragraphs why you liked Brown and ADOCH. Ignoring the girl, you've put in enough thought to justify your decision one way or another. You're right in that you shouldn't put significant weight on the speciifc friends you make at ADOCH, but if you think Brown and the atmosphere here helped make it easier for you to make those connections, that's something to consider.

Gotta run unfortunately. You can PM me too if you have any questions. Hope this was helpful and that you let me/us know one way or the other. You do have two great options here. Best!",8,,False,dglblz2,False,False,1492835265.0,2017-04-21 23:27:45
Major crisis in deciding where to attend (X-post /r/Applyingtocollege),matthewwehttam,"I'm not really going to comment on most of the Columbia stuff. I went to Brown, not Columbia. I have friends who decided to go to Columbia, and they certainly enjoy it, but I couldn't tell you a ton about campus culture or reassure you. Instead, I'll focus on Brown, probably apropos given the subreddit we're in. To begin, let's start with the more specific concerns.

1) The math department. I was/am in a pretty similar position. I'm very interested in mathematics, and I'm not totally sure about whether I want to end up studying pure or applied math. It's true that the pure math department doesn't have the best professors, but there are a couple of things to remember. First, that definitely isn't all of the professors. For example, I love my linear algebra prof. The second is that people still definitely get math majors, and they do fine. While it might not live up to going to a university with your favorite mathematician, but it certainly isn't insurmountable in any sense of the word. The other thing is that your primary fear is that this will push you into the applied math department. The thing is that this really a problem. It sounds bad, but what's the actual impact. If you like applied math at least as much as pure math, then there's no problem.You're being pushed towards something that you actually like. On the other hand, if you decide you don't enjoy applied math, you almost certainly aren't going to major in it, so that push you're talking about isn't really going to be a problem. You can just go ahead with pure math. That's really all I can say. The concerns you cite are accurate, but I don't think they're as concerning as you seem to think.

2) The core vs. the open curriculum. What stands out here is that you're drawn to the core are because you want to learn what it teaches. It will teach you about literature and high culture or what have you. However, this is exactly what the open curriculum was set up to provide. So what you want to do math, or stat, or whatever. That doesn't mean you can't take literature classes, and so you can take classes to become well versed in western literature. Also, you talk about how you aren't sure exactly what you want to do. Again, the open curriculum certainly allows you options, but Brown also has a ton of interdisciplinary concentrations in the areas you're looking at. For example, there's APMA-CS, APMA-econ, or CS-math. The other thing to remember is that you get maybe 40 different courses in your college career. Even if you like some of the core courses, you're still committing yourself to all of them. For examples, the frontiers of science course is 2.5% of your college career. That's a lot for a required class that you might not like. The core might have its advantages, but you should remember ever core class you take means you can't take some other course you might like more.

3) Imposter syndrome/insecurity. Imposter syndrome is certainly real, and it's a big problem. Here are some things to remember. First, you were let in for a reason. Sure other people might have a stronger math background, but that doesn't mean you don't deserve the opportunity to learn just as much as they do. It also doesn't mean that there actually better at it than you, just that they have more experience. On the Brown vs. Columbia thing, both schools have really smart people. Some people I met coming into Brown had finished Multivariable or LinAl before coming. The thing about Brown is that no one is making it into a competition. People aren't trying to establish a heirarchy or show off or anything. They talk about it because they're genuinely interested. Everyone here is smart, and everyone likes talking about what they're interested in. That means that sometimes you're going to be totally lost and feel stupid sometimes. The thing to remember is that someone else will feel that way when you talk to them about your area of expertise. (This last part is true of every school, but it's something to remember when you feel like you aren't good enough). In the end, you're good enough to go to either of the schools. On the other hand, the question of which culture in has a real impact on your reaction to stress, and by extension, your mental health. Because even if you're the best student, you're going to be stressed, it's just a question of where you are when you're stressed.

4) Regret. This is either inevitable or not a problem. If you constantly compare to see if you would be happier if you chose a different option, you will almost certainly feel regret, even if you go to Columbia. This is because people tend to compare on a very specific basis (eg: if I'd bought car X, then I could drive faster). That means you aren't making a holistic determination. Even if the car you bought was better in every other way than car X, you still think car X is better in some way and feel some regret. Even if you make the best choice. My recommendation is that after you make your decision, stop making those comparisions. Now if you go to one school and absolutely hate everything about it, you should transfer, and you should compare then. But remember that if you're happy that's enough because you can't change the decisions you've made.

My last piece of advice is that you should de-stress a bit. College is a huge decision, but at the same time, it kind of doesn't matter. Here we have two comparable institutions. They have their differences, but the thing to remember is that picking one over the other probably doesn't significantly change expected material outcomes. You'll probably happy if you go to Brown or Columbia. The difference between picking Brown and Columbia is who you become. Future you will be influenced by the people, classes, culture, city, and everything. In that sense, it's a huge decision. On the other hand, those things kind of don't matter. You'll be a different person either way. Instead, you should focus on which one offers the greatest chance of happiness on campus because predicting anything farther out than that is impossible, especially when you don't know what person future you will be. That's why I found it weird that you wanted someone to tell you that the intangible aspects were irrelevant because I think they're the most important. It's those intangible aspects that will affect you on a day to day basis. It's the campus culture that influences how you'll react to stress. It's the people you'll be with that will be the greatest determiner of your happiness on campus. There's only so much time you spend in class. In the end though, they still only affect you so much. So, relax. This is either the biggest small decision or the smallest big decision you'll ever make.",6,,False,dglfwp0,False,False,1492844722.0,2017-04-22 02:05:22

Additionally, think about where you will be happy because down the line there will not be a huge difference with what career or graduate schools u get into when comparing schools of this caliber. 

Lastly, discuss with you family and friends, that helps so you do not get overwhelmed. You really cannot go wrong with this decision, they're all amazing schools.

Major crisis in deciding where to attend (X-post /r/Applyingtocollege),tardigraderider,"Hey. Class of '14 graduate here who just went through this whole process again choosing master's programs. Like the others, I can't tell you which school to pick, but I will say that my experience matched your impression. My classmates were some of the most intelligent, witty, driven, friendly people you could ever gather together. Everyone was there to work hard, follow their passions, and have a blast doing it. 

I'm on moble so I can't remember all of your points, but I'll touch on a few.  Comedy was (and hopefully is still) a huge presence on campus. Improv was particularly popular, but there was also a stand-up club, sketch comedy troupe, and the Brown Noser, which published several satirical newspaper editions each semester. 

The academic freedom also means that if you want to study the classics, you can go crazy. Most people use their extra courses to satisfy their curiosity, and your education can be as well rounded as you want. Generally, if you're interested and can satisfy the pre-reqs, you can take any class you want. And even better, the class will be full of students who want to be there. 

Lastly, and don't take this the wrong way, you seem neurotic enough for NY. You'd fit in with most of the New Yorkers I know. Once you get used to the crowds, it's easy to just become another person In the city. Providence, on the other hand, has many the problems and perks of NY in a much smaller package. Even if you're easily overwhelmed, it's a pretty manageable city. I loved walking from campus to downtown.

Ultimately, you're going to be a different person in four years when you graduate, and each school will affect you in different ways. You've developed opinions of both places. Trust your gut. Don't choose Brown because of the girl- there will be plenty more cute girls (and/or guys, it's a spectrum, go crazy, be safe) at either school. Do choose the school that seems like the most supportive environment for you as a person. If your heart is set on Columbia, follow your dreams and you'll have a blast. If Brown has won you over with a few idyllic days beneath the elms, then you're making a great choice. Good luck either way, and please feel free to PM me. I'm happy to help.

Major crisis in deciding where to attend (X-post /r/Applyingtocollege),Lawltman,"Hey, I'm a class of '16 physics major (with heavy emphasis on math) who just accepted an offer for a PhD program in NYC. 

First of all, congratulations. You got into 3 excellent schools! The fact that you were admitted means you DO belong there. I've dealt with imposter syndrome as well, but really, college admissions isn't out to do you any favors, so if you got in, it means they think you'll do well there. 

Second, I get the sense from this post that you're a big overthinker. I am too. A few weeks ago I was choosing between two grad programs in different cities and did the same back-and-forth thing you're doing now. A good thing to keep in mind is I think you'll be able to find happiness no matter where you go. Yes, the overall atmosphere of a school is important, but the few people you met on prospie weekends are not always indicative of the school as a whole, and you'll be able to find people you connect with at either place.

That being said, some more specific things: 
What you heard about Brown having a better applied math program than pure math is true. I never took any applied math courses but I took LOTS of pure math, and I can say that I found all but 2 enjoyable and challenging. I have a few friends at Brown that I consider real geniuses who majored in math, and I remember that they got to do cool research projects with professors. I've also heard that the applied math program is among one of the best, so if you decide to go that route you'll be set. Of course, I'm sure Columbia's math program is great too, but I know nothing about it.

Again, I know nothing about Columbia's radio station, but I have a lot of friends who worked on WBRU the past few years (two of my close friends were the presidents), and honestly it seems like a really great organization/community. Don't know anything about the money issues you mentioned, but I know that people all over Rhode Island listen to WBRU, and many think it's the best station in the state. 

I'm from New York, and I love NYC like nothing else (part of why I chose my grad school), but I also really love Providence. There's plenty of clubs and live music if you're into that, and the river is just gorgeous. Parts of it feel a lot more like a small town or a suburb (particularly the East Side, where Brown is), but it's like a 10 minute drive to get downtown. Good mix and easier from you to get away from that fast-paced life, if that's what you want sometimes. 

That's all I can think of for now. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions and good luck with your decision and the next four years! It's gonna be great :)",3,,False,dglhpf9,False,False,1492850106.0,2017-04-22 03:35:06
Major crisis in deciding where to attend (X-post /r/Applyingtocollege),Animastryfe,"I attended Columbia and another university for undergrad, and I was just accepted to Brown for graduate school. I am thus not familiar with Brown, but I am reasonably familiar with Columbia. 

>While Brown does have the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM), my host said that the professors in the pure math department for undergraduates were not the best. Instead, Brown has a very strong focus on applied math rather than pure math.

This should not matter for your undergraduate education unless you are doing research at a higher level. A professor's teaching abilities have little correlation with their research ability, which I presume is what your host was talking about. This might be an issue if you are planning on attending graduate school and require recommendation letters, but I think this can be more than made up for by doing well in research and your classes. I suggest you ask one of the math subreddits about this.

As to your concerns about the attitudes of the student body, I cannot help you much with that. I was part of a special program where I transferred in as a junior from a top liberal arts college, so I mostly fraternized with students in or ""near"" my department, which was an engineering/applied science field. My experience with the students I was familiar with was very positive, and there was little difference in things like pretentiousness between those Columbia students and the students at my former liberal arts college.

Major crisis in deciding where to attend (X-post /r/Applyingtocollege),cant_read_captchas,"As someone who actually grew up in NYC, I know exactly what you mean when you describe the vibe of the city/campus at columbia. Nowadays I actively avoid living in urban areas.

Also, I majored in math (math/cs actually, but I took quite a few pure math courses, some graduate-level) and thought it was pretty good. However, without saying any names, I'll be the first to admit that one or two of the profs in the dept are not great teachers. These particular folks also happen to teach the intro-level calculus sequence, which is why you hear so many horror stories. More people take these courses, so it's more likely that you'll encounter people who get a bad impression of math. The upper-level courses are pretty awesome though.

> Instead, Brown has a very strong focus on applied math rather than pure math. That being said, I am not certain exactly which side of math I would like to pursue. Yet, I am afraid that I may be pushed closer to the applied side at Brown, simply because their applied department is stronger.

I mean, I'm not sure why that would be a bad thing. Brown APMA is often considered top 5 (sometimes #1) for applied math.

I would keep in mind that going to Brown doesn't cut you off from moving to NYC once you graduate or taking the Amtrak down. Obviously Providence isn't as exciting as NYC but from my experience (I've lived here pretty much my whole life) it's a pretty cool city for young people.

I honestly did not expect to get a response. Hopefully you won't mind answering all these questions (**feel free to pick and choose (but also number)** - either based on the fact that there may be too many questions or on the fact that some of these may be too revealing):

1. The big question: What was/is your view of the Open Curriculum? Has it changed at all from start to finish?

2. You made a decision from the very start to go down this track, why? Also, was there ever any second-guessing along the way? How did you react?

3. ~~What was your intended concentration/your actual concentration?~~ *Human Biology and Economics*

4. Do you come from an affluent background (you may be able to see where I'm going with this)?

5. Did you meet the bare minimum for your concentration requirements (i.e. if you needed just 10 classes for the degree, you took 10 and then went on to pursue other interests), or did you find you took as many 'elective' courses as your friends? And - assuming you did take non-concentration courses - how diverse were they from one another?

6. ~~How much did you study in comparison to similar concentrators?~~ *‚ÄúI crammed for orgo tests, I stayed up late for presentations just as often as anyone else,‚Äù*

7. Since you mention it, was doing a 5 year combined degree your original plan? Or did you find that, as you got closer to the 3rd/4th year, Brown was your only option for grad school?

8. What were your future, long-term options around senior year/5th year (nonprofits, research assistant, a paying job, etc)?

9. Did you find yourself taking more than the suggested 4 classes?

10. Did you fail any of your classes (if so, in what subject area - and why)? What was your S w/ Distinction track record like? Phi Beta Kappa?

11. ~~What did your academic adviser say when you told him/her your plans(? or maybe not?) to take all your classes S/NC? (haha)~~ *‚ÄúMy advisers were sometimes hesitant because they were worried about what would happen after college,‚Äù he said. But Heimark said his advisers accepted his choice because he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt doing it on a whim.‚Äù*

12. *Heimark said he has not had difficulty in his job search in the high-technology, biotechnology and consulting industries. ‚ÄúThere are certain industries where being traditional is important, but there are others where it‚Äôs not,‚Äù* - Examples?

13. What degree of freedom did you experience by pursuing this route? Do you think it would've been any less stressful than taking those classes for grades? Did you learn more?

14. Do you personally believe this is a decision more students should consider seriously? Why? Who is this option meant/not meant for (e.g. a specific concentration, a specific career path, etc)?

15. What were the advantages/disadvantages of taking all classes S/NC? (aside from the routine 'career opportunities', 'more freedom to learn' response)

16. Any regrets, comments, advice?

AMA: I took all my classes S/NC,jheimark,"I'm going to try and answer all of them, but please ask follow-ups because there is little chance I can do these questions justice.

(1) Wow, I could write paragraphs here. Suffice to say that I am glad the New Curriculum is still embraced by Brown students and faculty. The curriculum is what attracts a disproportionate amount of talent (both students and faculty). It's a distinct philosophy toward learning that attracts a different set of people and lasts for years after graduation.

I was extremely disappointed with the last curricular review (~2007?). The committee managed to find the only requirement ever suggested (writing) and start enforcing it. I wish they had found a way to bring back ""~~methods~~modes of learning"" courses - which were interdisciplinary courses designed by professors to educate students from other fields. I wish that instead of forcing students to take writing courses, or write summer essays before they arrive at Brown (yuck!), they treated students as adults and found other ways to encourage them to write, because it is an incredibly important skill. I think the requirement was an uninspired solution to an important problem.

(2) It's part of why I went to Brown. I went to a really competitive high school, and realized those with the best grades weren't always the ones who learned the most. I really disliked walking out of a final and hearing people say things like ""Well, there's a bunch of stuff I can forget now."" I wanted to spend college learning for myself, and what I wanted, not figuring out how to get the best grade from my professors. I think partially because of the open curriculum, Brown students tend to be much better about that kind of thing. 

There wasn't much room for second guessing. If I switched partway through, it would have been hard to explain to anyone that I took a principled approach toward my education, but gave up when it got difficult.

(4) Did I have a safety net? Yes. Does everyone at Brown? Yes, even if you don't realize it. I have friends who couldn't find jobs (bad economy in 2011) who had large student loans and managed to find jobs around Providence, often with the university itself. If you work hard, develop a few skills in college, and are willing to take whatever job you can get, it isn't that difficult to find gainful employment with a Brown degree. I also contacted the one other person I knew who had done this, and he was very helpful. I extend that same invitation to anyone else in the future who takes everything S/NC. I will help you find a job and we will make it work. Finances, or fear of finding a job, should not get in the way of your academic principles.

(5) I was all over the map, which I enjoyed. Because I had two degrees to finish in five years, I didn't have a ton of freedom, but managed to be a TA in both engineering and computer science, neither of which were in my concentrations. I also took some extra Econ classes, though not sure I took any biology (I ran out of college).

(7) Sophomore year I made the choice to do the dual degree. Nothing to do with grad school, I liked both concentrations and wanted both degrees. I think grad school would have forced a lot of focus on testing (GMAT/LSAT/MCAT/whatever). If I aced the test, I think schools would be excited about me. Anything less and I don't know what would have happened.

(8) I only looked at paying jobs, and stopped looking after receiving offers spring of my 5th year from tech firms that I liked. I can't imagine research or nonprofits would have cared about my grades, but who knows...

(9) Yes, all the time. Once I took three so I could focus on some extracurricular stuff (I was a Scoutmaster). But mostly took four/five.

(10) I dropped an advanced Econ halfway through my last semester that I didn't need because I was also doing research for the professor and it was getting in the way. I told my professors not to give me S with distinction because the whole point of my academic career was that it was for me, not for honors. I am the opposite of the only other person I know who took everything S/NC (he made PBK and was proud of it). I focused on long-term relationships with my professors, some of whom I still keep in contact with today.

(12) I've changed my mind on this - I think most industries are changing so quickly now they need to embrace nontraditional thinking. Academia may be the only exception, but I don't think it's difficult to get someone in Academia excited about an academic purist who took everything S/NC so they could focus on learning instead of grades. It's all about why you choose to go S/NC and how you frame it.

(13) Tons. There were times it was more stressful being S/NC. Especially in the middle of the semester when your friends want to go out. It forces you to look inward and challenge yourself a lot, which is a great skill to develop in college. That said, I found finals a lot easier than most of my friends. I used them as an opportunity to demonstrate what I had learned and find out where I needed to go back and learn more during my vacations/breaks. My friends found them super stressful.

(14) No. Students should make their own choices. If learning for yourself and removing external assessment is important to you, you will find your way to Brown. But I wouldn't encourage anyone to go out of their comfort zone or adopt a principle they don't completely agree with. I think that's a recipe for disaster.

I do wish people at Brown would realize that it is possible and sometimes even easier to get a 'real job' after taking everything S/NC. When I think back on my time at Brown, I came up against a lot of FUD from fellow students and even some administrators about how difficult I was making my life. A few Deans and professors were very supportive and made a huge difference in my life. I am very fortunate that I had them to support me.

(15) It became a huge part of my identity and made me do a lot of soul searching at Brown. That self-drive and self-motivation has carried over into my post-grad life, and I'm very thankful to Brown for providing an environment where I could do something a bit weird and develop a really important skill.

(16) Only that I can't figure out how to encourage more people to do what I did, or find out if there are any more like me. I hear about students taking a semester or year S/NC here and there, but I know of only one other person who has done it their entire Brown undergrad. What's the best way to do that?

I think a lot of the concerns that people have about taking everything S/NC is that it makes your life difficult, but I think if you're eccentric enough to make a choice like this, there's probably enough about you otherwise that jobs/nonprofits/graduate schools will either like or hate. You're betting on being the exception to the rule, which is actually easier sometimes, if you have a good explanation and are honest about your choices.",3,,1374034302.0,cb49ugo,True,False,1374033918.0,2013-07-16 23:05:18

I want to comment on point 4, both as it pertains to S/NC and more generally. Not everyone has a safety net here, especially if they are from non-affluent backgrounds. There are a lot of people I know at Brown, especially those with arts or humanities degrees, who haven't had luck on the job market. Yes, you can ""take any job you want"" in that you might be working at Target or Starbucks. Those will bring in some money, but I don't think it's what many people envision doing (or want to do) after four years at an Ivy.

I don't know how this translates to S/NC, but if you can't demonstrate considerable knowledge of marketable skills in the way a potential employer will understand, you may not get a good job.

To say ""finances, or fear of finding a job should not get in the way of your academic principles"" is perhaps not the best advice for students who are expected to support themselves and even their families after college. I think this extends to concentration/classes choice as well as S/NC.",0,,1374039219.0,cb4av4m,False,False,1374037220.0,2013-07-17 00:00:20

AMA: I took all my classes S/NC,jheimark,"I have always known it as the ""New Curriculum,"" and I still think of it as that. For background, I encourage everyone to skim [the magaziner-maxwell report](http://books.google.com/books?id=mfV2gJJ2n7kC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false).

I think adding the writing requirement was a mistake. I think a good education should leave students with a self-awareness and appetite for improvement that makes basic requirements like that unnecessary.

I think it is still way too difficult to create an independent concentration. I think formal concentrations are less important than they used to be. I would love to see a pilot/experimental program that did away with formal concentrations and encouraged students to build their own out of a set of classes, perhaps requiring something like 14 1000+ level courses and find an advisor.

I wish Brown spent more time encouraging professors to be formal mentors/strong advisors to their students. This should be easier today than it has been historically, as the student : faculty ratio improved so dramatically under Ruth Simmons. That would probably mean a formal recognition program or more money for advisors/mentors. Brown professors tend to be wonderful people who are not well rewarded for the amazing amount of time they spend with students.

As far as S/NC, I think embracing the New Curriculum means something different to each student. That was my way of shaping my education, but it doesn't have to be anybody elses. Of course, I have a soft spot for anyone who takes everything S/NC. And an understanding for those who try it and find out that it isn't for them.",1,,False,cb5btqh,True,False,1374167336.0,2013-07-18 12:08:56

There are a lot of people who come to Brown from low-income or middle class families and concentrate in CS/Engineering/other STEM because they want to have a stable job when they leave. But there are also people who don't. Some of them don't have the knack for STEM or don't enjoy it. Others don't understand how difficult it can be to find a non-STEM-related job.

AMA: I took all my classes S/NC,,"Sure! Most CS concentrators I knew took the vast majority of their classes for a grade. There were a couple of reasons for this:

1) some companies (Google, for instance) will ask for a transcript/GPA. They may not be opposed to S/NC, but it's still easier to have some numbers or letters there.

2) some of them were keeping the option of grad school open, or they thought they might want to do something different in a few years, in which case it might be helpful to have a transcript. 

3) The ones who took everything S/NC junior and/or senior years were highly sought-after individuals who were constantly being approached from recruiters from top companies and start-ups. By senior year, they had multiple offers (or had signed offers with top companies) and were fairly sure they would never need grades again.

I do think people have a tendency to glorify S/NC, though. It does give you permission to slack off, but most people end up working just as hard because they want to learn the material and actually get something out of the class. Also, typically if you make an effort, the professor and your peers will respect you more.

Also, most professors don't know whether you're taking a class S/NC or not (there are a few exceptions), so you will still see grades on your assignments.

FWIW: I took all my concentration classes (including some CS classes) for a grade. However, I took French my entire way through Brown. I was frequently in classes with native speakers who set the pace for the class (and a bar for grading). Knowing that I would be unable to speak and write at their level, I decided to take the classes S/NC to get more out of it without worrying about competing with the native speakers. I think it helped a lot as I could focus on what I was doing rather than on the grades I was getting. ",2,,False,cb51afs,False,False,1374123834.0,2013-07-18 00:03:54

It wasn't necessarily for psychological reasons, I just wanted to be away from academia for a bit.  I mostly worked full-time during my year off, though.

Here's a good guide of what to do:

1. Make sure your financial aid package, if you receive one, is squared away.  Make sure to file this as early as possible.  I believe it's 30 days after your re-admittance, but double-check on the financial aid webpage.
2. Building off of #1, make sure you have a meal plan included into your package.  When I was readmitted, I forgot to select a meal plan online.  The result: I went a semester without a meal plan.  I honestly don't know how I'm still alive.
3. Know class registration dates.  You can't register for classes until you're readmitted.  Also, you can't register for classes without your alt-pin if you haven't declared a concentration yet, so make sure to communicate with your academic adviser if this applies to you.
4. Once you're re-admitted, you're put back on the listserv for morning mail.  If you're getting morning mail, then you are readmitted.  It feels good when you get your first morning mail.
5. If you don't sign up for the housing lottery, they will assign it for you.  I learned that the hard way as well.  Check the reslife website, and contact them the semester before you want to go back.  They will let you know what you can do.  There is a secondary summer housing assignment that takes place in the summer I believe, so if you are coming back for Fall 2013 semester then maybe you can do that.

You might miss one of these points (or one I forgot to list), but it's not the end of the world.  What I've learned is that Brown is really flexible with missing certain deadlines, and whatever office you're working with tends to try their best to resolve your problems.

Also, you should feel isolated from Brown because you physically are.  I'm not saying that they shouldn't keep you in the loop more, but it's normal to feel left out.  I felt the same way as you.  It's strange because you ask yourself whether you will feel the same way after graduation, or if being an alumni feels different than a student on leave.  About a month into my first semester back, it seemed as though I never left.

As a Brown student that lives in Rhode Island, if you're in the area during the summer feel free to send a pm if you would like to meet up and talk about some of these things.  I'd be happy to give you some advice and help you out.",3,,False,c9t2o9w,False,False,1367795711.0,2013-05-05 18:15:11

as far as the support available for psychological health while at brown, i can't really speak to that--i basically realized i had problems and went to psych services.  i think the bdh has addressed this, though i can't remember the specifics, and some of the ways in which the system is lacking.  definitely sounds like another thing that's worth a lot of consideration by brown and its students.

Question about party scene,linkprovidor,"I highly recommend a substance free floor for freshman year, lots of cool people to hang out with with no pressure of drugs.  Lots and lots of social opportunities in general not based around alcohol.

You will almost certainly be offered drugs (well, really only pot) and alcohol, just be ready to say ""I really appreciate the offer, but no thanks."" 99% of any awkwardness generally comes from the person offering drugs feeling like you're judging them, so if you make it clear (indirectly) that you aren't, you shouldn't have any trouble. If any individual is weird about you saying no, any group you're in (except maybe a few of the single-gender frats, don't join those) is going to view that individual as weird, not you. 

Now, it is easy to avoid drinking or doing drugs yourself, you will likely end up in groups that occasionally throw parties with alcohol at the very least.  You can go to those and not drink or not go to those parties at all. You can even go to those parties and pour yourself a cup of orange juice and join a drinking game and people won't even know you're sober.   (A common drink in college is orange juice mixed with vodka.). The point is you've got a wide range of options.

Questions about Brown from a prospective ED applicant,cats_and_wines,"napsXfactsXsnacks made some great points! Adding on to that as a class of '19 immigrant non-white student from middle class family (Pell grant recipient, financial aid covered all of tuition and a good portion of housing/meals),

1. I think there's a pretty good music scene. I worked as a writer for WBRU radio station and got free tickets to go to local concerts and write up my reviews, which was pretty awesome. There are also house parties where Brown student bands would play live, which gives off a very retro vibe. Sometimes various student bands would hold concert in the greens as well.

2. I think there is a massive wealth divide in the sense that almost every socioeconomic class is represented. I consider myself solidly middle class (mom a waitress, dad a public school teacher so you get the idea). I went to public schools up until Brown, but never felt any acute lack of money in my life. I've had friends coming from low income/food insecure backgrounds to friends whose parents were corporate lawyers and hedge fund managers. I heard there was a Kennedy/Cuomo family member (the daughter of NY govr) in my class year. I do think that the bulk of the population lean towards the high income spectrum (most students come from high earning white collar families).

3. I was honestly surprised by how naturally like attracts like. In my freshman year, we had pretty much every identity you can imagine represented in my hall, but somehow wealthy students all became friends, social justice types became friends, etc etc. The ultra wealthy international students posted pics of them on a yacht over spring break. I had trouble fitting into any of the groups, and besides I was busy working 30+ hrs in the dining service on top of an intense course load so I didn't have time to hang out with people (if you have a choice, I don't recommend doing this). So I maintained only casual acquaintance/friendship with my first year dorm mates. Instead, I made my close friendships in my concentration, part time jobs, and student organizations. I wasn't in a single diverse friend group, per se, but I had diverse friendships, and I think that's a common experience.

4. I don't know much about the French dept, but I remember there was a French language program house (alongside the Spanish language program house) where students spoke French amongst themselves. You might want to check that out!",7,,1587691854.0,fo8yhhp,False,False,1587606530.0,2020-04-22 20:48:50
Questions about Brown from a prospective ED applicant,napsXfactsXsnacks,"I am class of 2017 so take this all with a grain of salt as it may be a bit outdated but

1. When I attended, there were tons of people making music together, having basement shows, and there was definitely a ""scene"". Many of the people from my time are still making music and are super dope. Providence also has a cool indie music scene.
2. Massive wealth divide - kinda. As I would describe it, the social life kinda breaks down into like: athletes, preps, artsy/social justicey, Black students have their own social group (I am Black myself, in case anyone reading is feeling like this distinction is racist), international students, bookish/hyper academic students, and ""everyone else"". There is definitely an ability to move across these categories with ease if that's what's natural to you. Most people I knew had plenty of friends in other ""categories"" but I would say a lot of your eating/partying/dating/socializing/living off campus tends to stay more ""in-group"" but it's easy and comfortable to be a ""tourist"" and sit with another group's table or go to another group's party (in my opinion but I'm fairly social). I would say some of those groups skew more wealthy (international and prep for sure) but at the same time, ultra-wealthy kids are sprinkled amongst all categories. I will say that I come from relative privilege but not ultra wealth (I went to private school but my name is not on any buildings, for an idea of what I mean) so it is very possible that some of these spaces may actually feel very exclusive to you if you come from a different background. I know I had friends who found the wealth disparities more upsetting/alienating than I did.
3. Diversity of friend groups - this is entirely up to you and what you make of it. If you are white and want to have lots of/majority nonwhite friends, you can, but ***prepare to be quiet and listen and learn and perhaps feel hurt when it comes to matters of race and racism in casual discussion.*** Prepare to make mistakes and have conflicts you don't understand, be willing to grow from these. If you are nonwhite, I think the world is your oyster at Brown. My friends were mostly different ethnicities, mainly immigrants, mixed race, and white immigrants or the children of immigrants (white and nonwhite). Wealth wise, same deal. If you are wealthy and want a diverse set of friends from different class backgrounds, get ready to shut up and listen and feel hurt and have conflicts you don't understand.
4. I don't know anything about the French department, so I'm sorry but I can't help you there.",8,,False,fo825p2,False,False,1587588568.0,2020-04-22 15:49:28
Questions about Brown from a prospective ED applicant,riotgrrrldiet,"Thanks so much for the response! I really appreciate it, and it‚Äôs clear you took a lot of time to answer my questions.



I didn‚Äôt know that international students usually distanced themselves from their domestic peers; as an international student myself, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs what I want to do (many internationals are extremely privileged and it becomes a bubble). As you said, Brown or any institution for that matter is my oyster.



The reason why I would love to have a diverse friend group is because I am one of the few people of colour in my school. While I do come from a place of immense privilege, (not donated a building or anything, private school, parents paying full tuition) my high school is very racist in so many of its ways and there‚Äôs this gross ‚Äútribe‚Äù mentality and it‚Äôs honestly quite scary.

If you want to prepare at all for the interview, I'd think about two things. Firstly, you should be ready to introduce yourself with maybe 1-2 pieces of information that the interview could be elaborated upon. How you start off the interview can affect how the rest of it can play out. Next, think about how you plan to take advantage of the open curriculum to make the best out of your undergrad experience at Brown. Mentioning specific professors you want to work with or specific classes you would like to take is always a bonus. 

My interviewer, in particular, was an engineering major that also took a lot of courses in philosophy, so we discussed that for a decent chunk of the interview itself.

Just got a 70 on my physiology midterm,one-palladium,"Hey. I took physio last year with stein as well and was in a similar situation. I studied for the first 2 exams and yet I wasn‚Äôt able to improve my grade by much. However, for the third and final exam, I switched up my strategy: I stopped going to lecture and spent 4-5 hours writing down every single word from lecture capture for each lecture.  Then, I went back through my notes and underlined parts I thought were important. It‚Äôs time consuming but the payoff is ultimately worth it. 

As for practice tests, I saved the most recent 2-3 for 2 days before the exam, and used the remaining exams to measure my progress with the material. For instance, after the cardiovascular lecture, I would do past questions for those lectures only. Then do respiratory questions after painstakingly jotting down every single word stein says in class via lecture capture. Wash, rinse, and repeat. 

I scored the highest on my third exam (arguably the least intuitive out of all the exam material) And ended up doing well in the class. I know several people who used this strategy and did equally as well. Best of luck op.",6,,False,f30l54b,False,False,1570556767.0,2019-10-08 12:46:07

In addition to feeling much more collaborative than competitive in CS vs JHU (known to be really competitive in STEM b/c premed is really popular), CS is our most popular concentration and I don't think I would be the only one to say that it truly feels like the department cares about us or is at least doing its best to provide a great education.

Brown will open your mind in intangible ways and introduce you to some of the most amazing people you'll ever meet.

Brown really opened up my horizons in terms of different interests and set me on a path to becoming who I am today.

Regarding the Meal Plan Requirement: Please consider signing this and showing your support! This all started with a phone survey...,ADeepCommittment,"I thought they already responded to a previous petition created when this was announced.


>	Dear Undergraduate Students, 

>We are writing to provide further context for the recent policy changes to strengthen food security announced last week in Today@Brown. These changes seek to ensure that all undergraduates at Brown have reliable access to food so that they can engage fully in their curricular and co-curricular experience as students. 

>While we understand that the sophomore policy change will require many students to reconsider their arrangements for meals next year, members of University leadership felt a shared obligation and responsibility to act immediately upon the evidence and recommendations provided by the Food Security Working Group. Based on student survey data and the demonstrated impact of last year‚Äôs meal plan policy changes, these recommendations seek to ensure that hundreds of students experiencing food insecurity this past year would be far less likely to do so in the future. 

>These changes are part of an ongoing commitment to address food insecurity at Brown. In addition to including meal plan coverage during spring break, other upcoming changes have been developed in conversation and collaboration with students. These include:

>eliminating the pre-fall meal plan by starting dining for all meal plans on Saturday, August 31, at no additional cost to students;
building on a successful pilot program this year to provide lunch and dinner meal plan coverage next year during senior week at no additional cost to students;
piloting a dedicated meal gap program significantly expanding the number of meals provided at dining halls to graduate, medical and undergraduate students experiencing temporary food insecurity; and
creating a dining working group with students to explore how best to provide food options that match student schedules and their curricular and co-curricular demands.

>We understand that food security and dining options are complex issues that engender strong reactions. We have and will continue to share student feedback with our colleagues in Dining Services to help inform their work moving forward. In June, you will receive detailed information directly from them about meal plan options. For those with dietary concerns, there is an existing process for Dining Services to work with students on a case-by-case basis to review requests for accommodations. 

>More work, of course, remains to be done. The University is committed to reviewing the feasibility of all recommendations from the Food Security Working Group as well as the concerns students have shared with us in recent days. We look forward to working with students and our colleagues in Dining Services on these efforts.

>Sincerely, 

>Eric S. Estes
Vice President for Campus Life

I can only find our positive COVID-19 cases through an article,citro-naut,"They're finalizing work on a Dashboard. This email went out earlier today. 


Dear Student,

 

I am writing to provide a number of updates with regard to the COVID-19 Routine Testing program, which we began on Monday, Aug. 24. I want to begin by thanking you for your participation in the program and your diligence in completing the symptom tracker, scheduling and taking your tests, and for your patience as we work through the challenges associated with launching a program of this scale and complexity.

 

Since Aug. 24, we have enrolled in the testing program 6,375 members of the Brown community who are studying, working or living on campus as part of our phased return to in-person operations. As of the end of the day Tuesday, Sept. 1, we have completed approximately 6,000 tests at the OMAC and Jewelry District testing sites. As of last night, over 5,400 of those tests had been returned as results, and we have had a total of 5 positive results. Some of the positive results represent prior infections of COVID-19 over the past 90 days, during which time a person can shed virus particles that are subsequently picked up by the test, even though the individual is no longer contagious. Consistent with CDC guidance, when an individual tests positive through routine or other testing, they will not be tested for the next 90 days. A public dashboard is being finalized, which will share testing information and other important campus safety metrics with the Brown community going forward.

 

While the low rate of positive asymptomatic tests is reassuring, it is by no means an indication that our individual or community vigilance with regard to health and safety measures should relax. It is an indication that the efforts we are all making every day ‚Äì wearing masks, washing our hands, maintaining social distancing, staying home when sick or exposed, participating in the testing program ‚Äì are working and that we need to continue those efforts in order to best protect ourselves, the Brown community, and our broader Providence and Rhode Island communities as well.

 

In general, the feedback we have received regarding the testing sites and testing process itself has been positive, and we have continued to make improvements based on participant feedback and suggestions. We have also been monitoring the timeliness of results closely. The Broad Institute picks up test samples from both of our testing sites twice a day, so those samples arrive in their Cambridge, Massachusetts, lab facility in the late afternoon or evening of the day the test was conducted. For the most part, the Broad Institute is turning around results within 24 hours of the sample arriving at the lab, so typically a day and a half after the test. That is consistent with what we anticipated but remains a metric of success that we assess on a daily basis.

 

We have, as many of you are aware, experienced challenges with the online scheduling process. A significant system update was installed by Verily last night and as of this morning we believe that most of the problems community members were having with scheduling their routine tests (following their initial baseline test) have been resolved. Some of the scheduling challenges have been related to the change in testing cadence from the summer pilot, when we were sampling the population and selecting participants at random for tests, to the fall when all participants are tested either once or twice a week. The update appears to have resolved those problems, and if you had been unable to schedule a test previously, please log on to https://healthy.verily.com and try to do so now. Going forward, depending on whether you test once or twice a week, you can expect the following scheduling cadence:

 

Once per week: You should receive an email notification from Verily to schedule your next test three days after you get tested at the OMAC or One Davol Square. You should be able to schedule your test any time over the next four days, and we recommend that you aim to schedule your test on the third or fourth day to space out your testing.

Twice per week: You should receive an email notification from Verily to schedule your next test the day after or the same day as you get tested at the OMAC or One Davol Square. You should be able to schedule your test any time over the next four days, and we recommend that you aim to schedule your test on the third or fourth day to space out your testing.


As a reminder, you can find additional details and a growing set of FAQs on the Testing & Tracing section of the Healthy Brown website. Please direct questions on the Verily web application including test appointments and results to Verily User Support (800-935-6634, healthyatwork@verily.com) and all other questions to Brown‚Äôs student testing support team (401-863-6500,  studenttesting@brown.edu) where a team of staff will be available to assist students.


I want to again thank all of you for participating in the testing program, and also thank the many colleagues who are working hard every day to support the program for students, faculty and staff.  

 

Sincerely,

5 courses per semester?,lostwaterbottlehelp,"It's definitely doable but you should be careful which classes you take. If you take 5 very STEM-heavy courses (orgo, honors multi, CS, etc), you probably won't have a good time. If you balance it out with a first year seminar, a survey course in a field that you are curious about, etc, then it's manageable.

People will tell you not to as a first year but you know your own abilities more than anybody else. Anecdotally, I was told not to take 5 and regret not doing so. I took 5 courses my second semester and for every one after that. Given how expensive tuition is, you might as well take 5 courses to take advantage of all of the resources available to you imo assuming that you can handle it and there isn't a significant trade-off with other things. 

Also, you can just shop 5 classes and if you think the workload will be too much, just drop one of them.

It might even be better to think of the 5th class as a ""pass if I'm lucky"" type class, and be totally happy with a fail (which wouldn't show up on your external transcript anyway).

Questions from Prospective Brown Undergrad (Computational Biology),conjjord,"Hi Rachel! I'm a freshman in CompBio and I cannot advocate enough for the program here at Brown. The only bad thing I've encountered so far in my admittedly short span is that some industry positions would prefer a CS/Bio double major as opposed to a single united major. However, I would argue that the interdisciplinary nature does wonders for your education, especially situated within the Open Curriculum.

It could not be easier to perform research as an undergraduate. I emailed a professor, attended a few meetings and for the past few months I've been doing research in the CCMB in deep learning and spatial genomics. I even did some computational training with a professor here as a prefrosh. All it takes is your own initiative. While I personally have not applied for internships yet, job placement is very good with quite a few graduates heading to renowned hubs like the Broad Institute. The professors here, especially in CompBio, are world-renowned and performing state-of-the-art research.

Brown is indeed very liberal, though I view that as more of a pro than anything else. Weed and alcohol are prevalent but no more so than at other places, and party culture calms down after the first few weeks. The people here, in general, are incredible. People walk throughout campus carrying conversations about their passion projects or favorite class content. They're always willing to help in any context, and they're brilliant in so many diverse ways. 

Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions!",4,,False,fnft2c9,False,False,1586914872.0,2020-04-14 20:41:12
Questions from Prospective Brown Undergrad (Computational Biology),cataholiccatholic,"I can‚Äôt answer the first question, but I can answer (most of) the second question. The stereotypes are not ~as bad~ as some people make it out to be. Sure people smoke weed and stuff but so do lots of college students. I wouldn‚Äôt even say the party scene at Brown is particularly heavy, especially when you compare it to big state schools. There‚Äôs stuff going on every weekend and you can find what you want or you can just chill in quieter spaces if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. My favorite thing about the culture at Brown is how nice the people are. When I went for my first visit in my junior year of high school (and I‚Äôm so sorry you aren‚Äôt able to get that opportunity!!), I was impressed with just the small group of students I met. ADOCH was no different.  Everyone was so nice, welcoming, warm, passionate, and overall just the type of people I knew I wanted to spend four years with! I don‚Äôt know much about the Midwest, but I did almost go to Carleton in Minnesota because I also thought the people were super nice. I‚Äôd say Brown students are similar. My least favorite part of the Brown community is how one-sided the narrative is. As you can see from my username lol I‚Äôm Catholic. I‚Äôve found an awesome group of friends in the (surprisingly vibrant) Catholic community, but it is pretty clear that there‚Äôs an unspoken rule about speaking views that are even slightly right of center, which some Catholic views inherently are. My favorite campus traditions include ADOCH for sure and the annual Mini Musical Festival. The festival isn‚Äôt necessarily a campus tradition though, it‚Äôs just something I like participating in every year as a student heavily involved in musical theater. Overall, I love Brown, but Brown is different than the rest of Providence. Providence is not great in my opinion, and I personally like to spend most of my time on College Hill. It‚Äôs not a very exciting town, the people aren‚Äôt that friendly, and it‚Äôs just not aesthetically pleasing a city. This is just my opinion, though, of course.

"Incoming freshman moving in in a week, very anxious about social life",WheatGerm42,"I was worried about the same thing when I started last year. Honestly, it was the only thing on my mind. Classes? Extracurriculars? Moving to Providence? Hardly even thought about that stuff. I just didn't want to be lonely. It's easy to feel like you're being thrown into this big, connected community by yourself -- the new kid. But try to remember that almost everyone around you will be feeling, more or less, exactly how you feel. Even the people who seem like they totally have their shit together are, in some ways, totally anxious about making friends. You'll find a group of people one way or another. It might be the people in your dorm, some of your classmates, or even people who just sit down and talk to you on the main green. It won't happen right away, and that's okay! Just know that eventually, it will. Don't spend too much time cooped up in your dorm (especially near the beginning), socialize with your dorm mates, talk to people in your classes, and try to join some clubs. But most importantly, don't overthink this or feel like you're gonna miss out on having friends if you forget to do something. I panicked the first weekend because I felt like I had no friends, packed a bag, and hopped on a bus to Montreal (where my friends were in school.) I remember my parents telling me that I'd never make friends if I spent too much time away from Providence in the first month. Was that good advice? I mean, kind of. I probably shouldn't have taken that trip. But did it mean that I never made friends? Of course not. It probably didn't matter at all.

should I appeal? FA is depressing af :'(,andylion,"I agree with the other posters and encourage you to appeal...the worst case scenario is they will say no at which point you're in exactly the same position you are in now. 

In the meantime...here's a dirty little secret about a lot of elite American colleges and universities. Schools like Brown are very concerned about their rankings in publications like US News, WSJ, etc. One of the major factors in these rankings is financial aid, which incentivize schools to give as much financial aid as possible. On the surface this is a good thing. However, since institutions like Brown can effectively set their own tuition, they will often do so knowing that they will be awarding a set amount of financial aid to every student. 

In other words, Brown knows how much tuition per student is needed in order for the university to function. It then decides on a figure in excess of that amount (often paralleling its peer institutions) with the understanding that the vast majority of students accepted will receive financial aid that brings the final cost of tuition down to the initial ""operational"" level. Brown then gets to claim that it averages tens of thousands of dollars in financial aid, even though it had no intention of ever collecting the full tuition from even a majority of students.

**MAIN CAMPUS:**
-Barus and Holley (mostly gender neutral restrooms but it's easy to find an empty classroom too)

-Stacks of the SciLi (turn off the lights and just cry in the books)

-MacMillan Hall (empty classroom)

-Empty rooms in Saloman/Wilson/Sayles (NOT around finals time due to traffic)

-The Cage on top of Faunce House, if you can get up there. If not, one of the hard-to-reach rooms on the top floor

-Marston Hall (very secluded)

**NORTH CAMPUS:**
-Smitty B gender neutral restroom, first floor

-I lived in NP3 and NP4 freshman and sophomore year so I used to cry on the roof

-Andrews (this is a little more dangerous due to foot traffic. Best time to cry would be 2-4pm when there aren't any people).

-Restroom next to the VDub (nobody ever goes there)

-CIT (nobody will be able to tell you apart from the CS students lmao)

**SOUTH CAMPUS:**
-PW/TF Green (you can swipe in and just cry in the hallway. Try not to go on a show day, obviously)

-Secret garden behind the MCM building

-ResLife/Grad Center E (I work here -- If you really need to cry someone quiet, let me know and I'll help you out)

-New Dorm A gender neutral restroom, first floor

What does brown value and would like to see in an application?,sr41489,"I think Brown prides itself on having a diverse and inclusive environment. While grades and test scores matter to an extent, Brown looks for exceptional people who are doing what they can to improve/help their community. The school looks for creative students who can apply what they know to the real world and solve complex problems. I‚Äôm an alumna of the graduate school and volunteer to interview prospective undergrads every application cycle. I have interviewed about 40 candidates thus far and the ones that get accepted come from various walks of life - the most common characteristics I see are: strong inner motivation, ability to lead and also take directions in stride, use critical thinking to question authority and speak out/act when things are unjust, and overall have an open mind. A common question I ask is how the student will cope with having an open curriculum, coming from such a structured high school setting. I also like to see if students can think on their feet, I‚Äôll ask some questions you‚Äôd normally see in a consulting interview (i.e. approximately how many ping pong balls do you think could fit in a 747 jet?) I‚Äôm not looking for a correct answer (I don‚Äôt even know the answer!) but I want to see if they can think critically and defend their answer with logic.

Should I get a Mac or Windows for school?,WheatGerm42,"Short answer: you‚Äôll be fine with anything. Don‚Äôt worry.

Long answer: Depends on what you value in a machine, and how much you‚Äôre willing to spend. If you‚Äôre just planning on doing word processing and web browsing like most folks and you‚Äôre willing to drop a thousand dollars on a laptop, your best bet is a macbook air (with Applecare!) It‚Äôs light, durable, responsive, and there‚Äôs an Apple store in the mall in case you have any problems ‚Äî this can make a HUGE difference over having a windows laptop break down and having to ship it out for repairs for god knows how long. 

If you‚Äôre planning on PC gaming (which is the only real reason to spend *more* on a windows laptop) I‚Äôd look at something like an XPS 15 or a Razer Blade 15 (the latter is a little less reliable, a bit more expensive, but a hell of a lot more powerful.)

If you‚Äôre looking for a budget laptop, I‚Äôd consider a refurbed macbook air or something like an LG Gram.

Personally, I use a Razer Blade 15 and an iPad Pro (the combination is totally overkill but I‚Äôm a dork). I‚Äôd highly recommend the iPad if you like taking notes or doing annotations by hand (as a Lit Arts major, I do this a LOT) but I wouldn‚Äôt roll with it as your only machine, since it has its limitations.",5,,False,fo1muf3,False,False,1587436761.0,2020-04-20 21:39:21

On the other hand, bootcamping Windows on Mac has pretty much been identical to just running Windows natively.

Not the end of the world, but definitely different than using an ASUS machine for Windows of a similar caliber.

Why can't outside scholarships lower my EFC?,reportabitch,"Ok, I get that maybe the EFC shouldn't ""change"" but outside scholarships can't be applied to them. For instance, say that my EFC is $20,000. If I got a $10,000 outside scholarship, Brown would see that and increase my EFC accordingly so that after my $10,000 scholarship was applied, I'd still owe them $20,000 more. So basically, Brown is getting $10,000 extra more dollars than it would be getting had I not gotten the scholarship and the EFC remains the same financial burden. 

There are some things that I can use my outside scholarships for, such as taking care of student work and summer work expectations, as well as a one time computer purchase, but since COVID-19 has eliminated summer work expectation, after about $3,000 worth of scholarships, everything else Brown keeps and doesn't help my situation.

RISD/Brown and Athletics? Need advice.,ADeepCommittment,"3. 99% sure you have to be enrolled at Brown. NCAA rules are strict and Ivy League's are even stricter.

I think you should first find out about on/off season practice schedule. 

As an athlete on another team that practices both seasons 6x/wk 2-6PM, it's been impossible to find time for a studio class since they almost always conflict with practice, not to mention the time commitments of being an athlete. 

If you're traveling every weekend in season you'll have to get most of your work done from Mon-Thurs as it's super hard to get work done while traveling. This makes doing full-on CS + RISD + athletics extremely difficult. It could be done, but would certainly take a huge chunk of time away from other college experiences unrelated to education.

However, you can take advantage of the Open Curriculum by ""cherry picking"" as you said. 

You could take Wintersession at RISD (it's free) or VISA courses. Maybe take RISD courses in the spring since football is in the fall. You could get an A.B degree in CS (9 requirements) or major in something else and cherry-pick CS courses.

While doing these three will be extremely hard anywhere you go, Brown provides amazing freedom so you can make it work.

Pre- Med at Brown vs Duke,ZacharyRD,"The two schools are so different in terms of how they teach, the culture, the student bodies, and so on that I think you're probably thinking of your choice in far too narrow a set of factors, and realistically not the most important factors.",11,,False,flv03yg,False,False,1585513611.0,2020-03-29 15:26:51
Pre- Med at Brown vs Duke,acetrainerelise,"You shouldn't base the strength of a premed program on research opportunities alone (which Brown also has plenty of). To get into med school, you need a good cumulative GPA, sciences GPA, and MCAT, as well as clinical hours, nonclinical volunteering, shadowing, and -as you said- research. 

In terms of grades/MCAT: None of the major premed classes reverse-curve (which has the added bonus of nobody being cutthroat- I haven't interacted with a single gunner fool in all of my time here so far), and since we don‚Äôt have +/- grades, it‚Äôs easier to keep a high GPA. Also, since 1 class = 1 credit at Brown, my A in Intro to Linguistics (3 hours of work per week) boosts my GPA just as much as my A in Basic Physics (12 hours of work per week). At other schools where classes with labs (which are almost always harder than non-lab classes) are worth more credits, this can disproportionally impact your GPA. To further help with your GPA, you can't get a D at Brown, and if you fail a class, Brown won't report that on your external transcript. Brown also won't report classes that you withdraw from. Our curves can be pretty generous compared to other schools'- off the top of my head, orgo and physio are both curved so that an 85%+ is an A, physics varies year to year but is usually an 88% I think. The average Brown MCAT score is a 515 last I heard, which is like 93rd %ile. I think our first-time med school acceptance rate is <90%, which is more than double the national average (~40% ish). For whatever it's worth, some people on r/premed claim that Ivy league med schools prefer to admit students from other Ivies, but I don't know enough about that to confirm or deny. Almost every med school, Brown included, shows a slight preference for undergraduates from that university (yes, that includes us regular premed folk and not just the PLMEs), but like everything else in med school admissions, it's not a guarantee. 

I think research is pretty much like any big institution- email enough professors and you're bound to get something. I would guess that the number of people competing for the same lab position is smaller at Brown than at Duke, but I don't have any statistics to back that up. Anecdotally, my boyfriend got his lab position just by going up to his professor after class one day and asking. I've had one biotech internship so far, and I'm doing academic research in linguistics because med schools couldn't care less what you choose to research- they just care to see that you're applying your academics to a real-world question. Linguistics/psychological sciences research is, by the way, super easy to find.

In terms of other ECs: the Swearer Center handles most non-clinical volunteering and most programs expect 2-3 hours per week, but there are some that you can get away with just an hour per week. There‚Äôs plenty of options to choose from. For clinical hours, you could volunteer at Miriam, Hasbro, or Rhode Island Hospital (kinda boring imo, but very standard for premeds). Brown EMS is pretty competitive to join, but you could also gain clinical experience with an EMT certification at Rhode Island Free Clinic or, if you can get a car on campus (I rented a spot off an upperclassman), you can get volunteer 911 experience a neighboring town- this is what I‚Äôm doing. You can also get paid experience as an inter-facility transport EMT, and there are several such companies around Providence. Scribing and being a Medical Assitant are also perfectly valid options. I do know that med schools prefer clinical volunteering to paid clinical work, though.

In my mind, the biggest downside to being premed at Brown is the course scheduling. Most of the upper-level biology classes don't have labs, and med schools want you to take at least two biology classes with lab. This limits you to intro to bio (BIOL0200, spring-only), physiology (BIOL0800), genetics (BIOL0470, fall-only), microbio (BIOL0510, spring-only), and a handful of seminars. Our chemistry courses also fall in a very strict fall/spring sequence, so if you don't take CHEM0330 (gen chem 2) freshman fall and you don't want to take a gap year between college and med school, you'll have to take the MCAT during the semester when you take biochem and mostly self-study biochem. I really recommend that you check out [our course registration website](https://cab.brown.edu/), the [Health Careers Advising website](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/health-careers/first-soph/pre-medpre-health-profession-courses), and the [requirements](https://www.brown.edu/undergraduate_concentrations) for the concentrations that you're interested in, paying careful attention to which courses are offered in the spring or fall only, to see what your required courseload will look like.

Pre- Med at Brown vs Duke,shoukawa,"It‚Äôs hard for me to speak to premeds as a PLME at brown but many of my friends are pre med so hopefully I can shed some light on this.

Brown will give you a lot more academic freedom in how you want to pursue your undergraduate education.

If there‚Äôs a certain class that catches your attention (e.g. ancient Egyptian literature), but don‚Äôt want it to take too much time/effort away from your premed/concentration studies, you can take it pass/fail (S/NC). 

I think you will find a lot more research at Duke, but from what I‚Äôve gathered those opportunities are more competitive to get than at Brown.

Our oped on grad student unionization appeared in the BDH today. I‚Äôm one of the authors. Feel free to share your thoughts.,RiskyCelery,"I made this account to comment on this issue. 

I am an eligible voter in the upcoming union election. When I first heard about unionization from a grad student organizer with SUGSE, I was happy to sign a union card and later a vote yes pledge. But I am honestly not sure I am going to vote yes now. 

**My reasons to vote no:**

1. I find SUGSE's aggressive recruitment/outreach off putting. Interacting with their representatives and attending their meetings has given me the impression that (1) they do not tolerate dissent and (2) they do not understand the history of unions/labor in the US. The AFT rep that was removed (Leah Fishbein) disingenuously posed as a student. 
2. SUGSE plagiarized their letter accusing admin of deliberately disenfranchising students of color. 
3. SUGSE (which AFAIK is predominantly composed to white students) agreed to an election that didn't specify use of absentee ballots and then used students of color as pawns to get absentee ballots. SUGSE will not acknowledge that they are just as guilty as admin in overlooking the voting right of students abroad/who might need absentee ballots. 
4. I am honestly not sure if grad students are workers. The dynamic between professor/student or advisor/student or admin/student is fundamentally different from that of employer/employee. Part of me thinks that student unionization will lead to universities becoming more like corporations, and that's not something I want or that I think other students should want. 

**My reasons to vote yes:**

1. I think the grievance processes at Brown are flawed. I have heard from female peers about harassment and differential treatment from male faculty. I think a union might foster a stronger, more organized voice against this and similar issues.
2. Student organizing has resulted in gains. Dental insurance is the example that comes to mind.
3. Maybe grad students would have a better quality of life in an employee/employer relationship with admin.  
4. I have felt alone in dealing with personal issues with admin, and having a union backing me up might have helped.

I don't know. I don't trust, like, or feel comfortable interacting with SUGSE.  But if this is realistically Brown's one chance to unionize and if it would help grad students who will be here after I've graduated, who am I to take the potential of a union away from them?

I'm interested in hearing thoughts from people on both sides of the issue. Skipping elections isn't usually my style, but I think non-participation might be the best way for me to go.",5,,False,e9g8oj7,False,False,1541892889.0,2018-11-10 17:34:49

1.	The GSC has been working on a revised grievance procedure for a while now. That was a known problem. We fixed it without SUGSE‚Äôs help and despite their tendency to get in the way with extreme rhetoric, which makes negotiation much more difficult. 
2.	Dental insurance has been in the works for a while. Dean Weber was already working on it years ago. Contrary to the popular perception, the grad school admin often advocates our side against pushback from the broader university leadership. We already have collective bargaining. It just happens to be the existing grad school admin. It‚Äôs a shame that more people don‚Äôt realize that. 
3.	I completely agree with this one. It was my primary reason for supporting unionization previously. 
4.	That is unfortunate. I can tell you that there are many people who will advocate for you in cases like this. You can contact me privately if you would like my help. 

I personally don‚Äôt believe for a second that this is the last chance for a union. Not by a long shot. This has become a national issue, and it won‚Äôt disappear if we vote no this time. If I believed that, I would be arguing that everyone must vote yes. 

One of the best arguments for voting yes that I‚Äôve heard so far concerns what happens at other universities, where grad students don‚Äôt have it as good as we do.

I chose to reply to this comment because it seems reasonable to respond to the highest-level comment, not because of anything specific in its content. 

>	I also find it very difficult to believe you‚Äôre acting in good faith when you claim that this is ‚Äúnot a vote against future unionization at Brown.‚Äù You know as well as I do that there‚Äôs no reason for the university to ever agree to another unionization drive without the NLRB, and that there are very, very good reasons for not wanting to go before the NLRB for the foreseeable future.

You can think whatever you want about me, but I do genuinely believe this. That‚Äôs why I wrote it. Well, technically I wrote the original version and then someone else reworded it, but the sentiment came directly from my own mind (and solely from my mind). I‚Äôve never seen this argued anywhere else that I can remember. 

There are plenty of ways for another unionization vote to occur later. Unionization among grad students is on the rise across the country. Unions are usually a good idea. Most grad students support unions on principle. The administration is not opposed to unionization categorically, even though it clearly isn‚Äôt in its interest to advocate it. 

The will to create a union will not die with this vote‚Äôs failure. If it did, that would be an argument against unionization. People don‚Äôt really want it in the long run, but they can be convinced to support it at this moment in a fit of pique? That would pretty obviously make it a bad idea. It‚Äôs not a bad idea, and people would support it the day after a failure of this drive to the same extent that they support it now. To put it simply, right-wingers oppose unions. Grad students are, on average, leftists. Until that changes (i.e. never), there will be plenty of support for a union.

>	I would only say that the ‚Äúaccusation of a conspiracy‚Äù is no such thing

That‚Äôs exactly what it is. Read SUGSE‚Äôs letter. They didn‚Äôt accuse the admin of accidentally disenfranchising students of color, they accused them of doing it deliberately. This would mean that grad-school administrators sat down and tried to think of a way to influence the outcome, and then they decided that preventing students of color from voting would be a good strategy. That‚Äôs the definition of a conspiracy. (Just as an aside, it would also be a terrible strategy, Students of color have consistently been the most vocal opponents of unionization.)

>	You don‚Äôt need to be motivated by racism to have a racist outcome. That‚Äôs literally what structural racism is.

I acknowledge that I‚Äôm no expert on structural racism, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not correct. Structural racism is created by racist people for racist reasons. You‚Äôre conflating conscience discrimination with unconscious racial bias, but unconscious bias is still racism. I can‚Äôt even think of what else we would call it. At any rate, the letter accuses the admin of consciously excluding students of color. You can call that whatever you want, I would call it racism. 

>	I would ask any undergraduate who handed me the ‚ÄúHealth and Family Care‚Äù section as an assignment to rewrite it for argument and clarity.

>	my adviser would certainly never stand for this sort of hatchet job

These are two different versions of the same straw man. This is an oped, not an academic paper. It was written quickly in loose collaboration and rushed to print. It is a screed, and was always intended to be. In fact, I described my vision as ‚Äúa jeremiad against SUGSE‚Äôs shenanigans‚Äù in my pitch to some of the other authors. Call that a hatchet job if you want, it‚Äôs an overt attack on SUGSE for being awful. If SUGSE doesn‚Äôt want to get taken to task for being awful, it should stop it. It‚Äôs pretty easy to not act like a horrible person. I manage to do it most of the time. SUGSE has proven itself to be incapable of it at any given time. 

>	I know a name or two on the OP-ed list, and those I do recognize have always been forcefully opposed to unionization. As such, I find it hard to credence the ultimate conclusion that this is just about SUGSE‚Äôs behavior.

Again, believe whatever you want about me, but I also wrote that bit, and I meant it. By all means feel free to mention names of the anti-union people you know. In my case, I have not always been opposed to unionization. What changed my mind was seeing countless instances of dishonesty from SUGSE over the past year. When I joined the GSC, I was pro-union and pro-SUGSE. Being able to see all of these events from every side was eye opening, because it became painfully obvious whenever SUGSE was lying, which happens frequently. I can‚Äôt remember everything off the top of my head, but just to list a few instances: 

1.	SUGSE publicly accused the admin of working on an updated grievance procedure in order to minimize its effectiveness as a SUGSE campaign promise. Not true. The GSC and admin have been working on an update to the grievance procedure for over a year using Cornell‚Äôs recently-developed procedure as a template, after the GSC reviewed Cornell‚Äôs model at a past Ivy+ summit. SUGSE had nothing to do with it. This is all in the public record, and I know that it‚Äôs all true because I witnessed it first hand. In fact, SUGSE‚Äôs dishonest public statements were a major hindrance the entire time. We all would have been better off without them.
2.	SUGSE claimed that its activism resulted in improvements to health care. Not true. Dean Weber first advocated for improved health care and dental coverage five years ago. I know because I spoke to him about it at the time. This was a battle between the grad school admin and the university. SUGSE didn‚Äôt even exist when it began.
3.	SUGSE accused the admin of trying to use Trump‚Äôs election to prevent unionization by reevaluating the previous agreement under the new NLRB. I‚Äòm not sure where that even came from, but it seems to be completely made up. They speculated about the most underhanded strategy they could come up with and then accused the admin of trying to do it. The admin never even suggested such a thing and rejected the claim to me in person immediately after SUGSE made it. Is it possible that someone floated this idea at some point? Of course (frankly, they‚Äôd be foolish not to consider it), but it was never an established strategy. There‚Äôs a big difference.
4.	SUGSE reps accused our DGS of union busting when we told them that he unfailingly helps and supports graduate students. (He‚Äôs been kind to us for years in order to thwart a possible future union vote? That‚Äôs absurd.) SUGSE reps accused my advisor of being anti-union when I said: ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt think he gives a shit.‚Äù Kindness is union busting, apathy is union busting, having a private opinion against SUGSE is union busting. Basically everything that SUGSE doesn‚Äôt like at any given moment is union busting. Do you even know what ‚Äúunion busting‚Äù means? It means preventing people from organizing to demand a union, usually using threats and force. Real union busting would mean no SUGSE. It hasn‚Äôt happened. 

Maybe I‚Äôll remember more later, but four should be enough to show that I have personally witnessed the behavior that I‚Äôve complained about. I witnessed it from a position that enabled me to see the underlying truth and falsehood of each and every claim SUGSE made. SUGSE lies to you constantly. It lies to you more often than it tells you the truth. You can believe whatever you want, but you‚Äôre not going to convince me otherwise, because I saw these things with my own eyes, I heard them with my own ears. I know for a fact that SUGSE lies to graduate students. I know that it has lied to me.

>	I‚Äôm trying to wrap my head around how any of this is a reason to not support or want a union.

It isn‚Äôt, which is why we were very careful with our language in the oped. It‚Äôs not a reason to oppose a union, it‚Äôs a reason to oppose SUGSE‚Äôs union. People who ask to be voted into power have to live up to a high standard of integrity and trustworthiness. SUGSE wants us to vote them and their associates in the AFT into a position that gives them power over our lives (and shunts university resources to them in the process). They don‚Äôt deserve any of that. They don‚Äôt meet the requirements.

Again, I‚Äôm pro-union in principle. All SUGSE had to do was not be horrible, and I would still be actively supporting it.

Our oped on grad student unionization appeared in the BDH today. I‚Äôm one of the authors. Feel free to share your thoughts.,Osarnachthis,"It isn't what they agreed to. The NLRB rules don't allow for absentee ballots, and both parties agreed to adopt NLRB rules and respect the result (without actually including the NLRB because of trumpism). According to members of SUGSE, the provost verbally agreed to consider the possibility of absentee ballots during their negotiations and then decided to draw a hard line on the rules after the fact. Perhaps he did. It's SUGSE's word against his right now.

The issue came up because students of color contacted SUGSE. The date of the vote conflicts with a major national conference that those students had already planned to attend. They asked SUGSE to lobby to change the date and/or to allow absentee ballots. The admin said no to absentee ballots straight away (SUGSE  is in charge of the date, no word from them on that yet as far as I know). Then SUGSE decided to accuse the admin of disenfranchising students of color for not caving on the issue of absentee ballots. It should be fairly obvious to anyone that the admin's decision was almost certainly not motivated by racism, but SUGSE decided to play it that way because they knew that would get everyone's attention.

The reaction from those students was part of the motivation for this oped. As you can imagine, they didn't appreciate being used for propaganda purposes, and many people feel that the accusation leveled at the admin crossed a line. One student wrote a letter in response and has given me permission to share the contents publicly, but wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the zealots in SUGSE.

Which is, of course, why they currently employ a law firm which specializes in union busting. The university keeps saying this, but at least be a *little* skeptical.

> They didn‚Äôt accuse the admin of accidentally disenfranchising students of color, they accused them of doing it deliberately.

Refusal to negotiate a solution after being made aware of the problem is, in point of fact, a deliberate action. But it looks like this has been resolved by expanding the voting window to Monday. It's almost like rhetorical posturing is useful.

EDIT: And absentee ballots, too!

I can tell.

Whenever you decide to eat the administration's talking points, is how I would say it.

> SUGSE claimed that its activism resulted in improvements to health care. Not true. Dean Weber first advocated for improved health care and dental coverage five years ago. I know because I spoke to him about it at the time. This was a battle between the grad school admin and the university. SUGSE didn‚Äôt even exist when it began.

For example: dental coverage is the ultimate product of the first unionization campaign, blocked by the NLRB, which brought attention to the subject. IIRC, dental coverage comes from a dedicated outside donation inspired by the unionization efforts. SUGSE is the legacy of that effort. It's good of Dean Weber to claim responsibility, because that's a great example of the ""benevolence"" of the neoliberal institution.

> It isn‚Äôt, which is why we were very careful with our language in the oped.

That wasn't directed at you at all. It was asking another poster why they thought being comfortable was a reason to oppose unionization. But, since we're here, were you being very careful or rushing to print?

> If SUGSE can‚Äôt champion its cause honestly and respectfully, then it can‚Äôt demand that we pull any punches either, and it certainly can‚Äôt claim that it will serve us well once it wins our votes.

Not that I agree with any of this, but my response to seeing things I didn't like in the unionization campaign - as someone who is pro-union in principle - was to get involved in it.  When I see something I don't like, now I can talk to that person directly, and they're more receptive to the feedback because I have already demonstrated that I'm on their side. And I found it incredibly easy to do so - I expressed some concerns to my union rep, and they drew me into helping provide solutions.

So, if you really are pro-union but are very concerned with the particular hierarchy, why has *this* been your chosen line of response?",6,,1541697018.0,e9aqnbe,False,False,1541693461.0,2018-11-08 10:11:01

Our oped on grad student unionization appeared in the BDH today. I‚Äôm one of the authors. Feel free to share your thoughts.,Osarnachthis,"That‚Äôs the gist of it, but it‚Äôs an even stronger claim. The grad school admin advocated dental benefits before SUGSE even existed. Maybe students complained, maybe the admin did it of their own accord. I suspect it‚Äôs the former, and SUGSE will certainly credit student activism, but neither would surprise me. Many things that we now have were sought on our behalf by the grad school without any input from activist groups. 

It is somewhat important to understand the landscape of decision making at the university. There are multiple interconnected entities, and it is quite complicated, but to over-simplify a bit: the grad school admin manages the grad school exclusively (as in that is their only job). They propose a budget, which they lobby the corporation for. If anyone wants grad students to have dental insurance (or anything else), they have to convince the corporation that this is an important/necessary expenditure. They don‚Äôt always succeed, but just by trying they are bargaining on behalf of grad students. They choose which things to fight for based on the feedback they get from students. This comes from the GSC‚Äôs (and other‚Äôs) agenda items, which they argue for at regular meetings, and it comes from *ad hoc* advocacy, which students do on their own by talking to administrators.

In my case, when a student complains within two meters of me, I go to the relevant dean‚Äôs office hours, explain the problem, and then put the dean in direct contact with that student to decide on the next step. Literally anyone could do that at any time. I‚Äôve been doing this since before I was involved in the GSC, and I started doing on the simple assumption that it would work. I kept doing it because it works very well. I strongly suspect that many of the most diehard SUGSE people have never tried this. It‚Äôs clear enough from their own words that they believe that all non-democratic power is inherently corrupt and cannot be otherwise, so they wouldn‚Äôt even bother. Hence the regular use of the word ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù in their public statements. The big problem with this is that pure democracy silences all but the majority, so it‚Äôs really not an ideal system for some situations. The makeup of a grad school is the perfect example. Students of color and other minority voting blocs aren‚Äôt well represented in a pure democracy, but they are relatively well represented now. As things are, any student can advocate any cause directly to the decision makers. Those people are sensitive to these sorts of issues by nature, which makes them effective allies for those groups. 

Quick aside: This is why so many of us were pushed to our breaking point by the recent accusation of disenfranchisement. It isn‚Äôt just that it‚Äôs false, it isn‚Äôt just that it‚Äôs exploitative. It is both of those things of course, but it‚Äôs also accusing people who have actively dedicated themselves to fight for URMs of being closet racists. If you‚Äôre genuinely interested in helping students of color, attacking the most reliable advocates they have right now is just about the worst thing you could possibly do. Those of us who believe in the moral principles that the university has long been fighting for were saddened and angered to see the admin dragged through the mud and accused of doing the exact opposite. It‚Äôs also very worrying that this is how SUGSE handles these sorts of issues. 

The basic premise of unionization in general is that the people at the top are well organized and well coordinated, which gives them a strategic advantage over those at the bottom. Logically, if the people at the bottom organize (by forming a union), then they can claim this advantage as well and level the playing field a bit. Well, grad students at Brown are already organized. We have a dedicated staff of administrators who advocate our causes, and they have proven themselves to be receptive to input from student groups and individual students. Adding another layer in the form of a union is a symbolic victory for leftist ideals, but in reality it doesn‚Äôt change much. It might even make things worse. This is why so many left-leaning people are working together to oppose this decision, and why were so eager to point out that we are leftists ourselves. We‚Äôre not against unions, we‚Äôre against this union. It‚Äôs the difference between dogged adherence to ideology and flexible, strategic decision making. We both want the same things, but we disagree about the best way to get them. 

Also, they have been acting like massive jerks, which makes it much easier for us to say what we think. ",2,,1541919464.0,e9gvzx3,True,False,1541917775.0,2018-11-11 00:29:35

I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo intelligent‚Äù for anything, but I know too much about history to misunderstand the nature of our world. People are fundamentally good (on average) and they want to do the right thing. No one has all the answers. We‚Äôre all just figuring it out as we go. The people who disagree with me are not evil, and we usually aren‚Äôt even enemies. The world is the way it is right now, and the way it has always been, because of the emergent properties of individual actors doing what they believe to be right, often selflessly. It‚Äôs not perfect. Sometimes bad things happen (e.g. Trump), and then we have to fight, but it works well for the most part. 

I don‚Äôt have time for any argument that says we need to flip the tables. The people making these arguments are generally naive and frustrated by their lack of power. But those who serve others acquire power without even trying, and then they use it to do the best they can. In my time here, I‚Äôve acquired a remarkable amount of power to get things done on behalf of grad students. I started out trying to help people because helping people makes me feel good, and I found that it was easy. When you serve others, doors open to you, and the people behind those doors drop whatever they‚Äôre doing to listen. Sometimes you have to fight them (trust me, I‚Äôve fought with the admin many, many times), but they will continue to respect you while disagreeing. This is why I support the administration. I know them. They‚Äôre good people. I suspect that the people pushing for a union have never even tried this approach. Their preconceived notions of how the world works (i.e. cynicism) have become self-fulfilling prophecy. 

I apply this reasoning to the SUGSE too. I believe that they‚Äôre doing what they believe is right, and I applaud them for that. They seem naive to me most of the time, but they aren‚Äôt bad people.

"Getting destroyed by CS15, need help",Mimobrok,"It definitely takes some time to learn how to code. The projects for CS15 were not easy, even for those who have coded in Java before. Unfortunately, the collab policy is as it is, so here is my suggestion as someone who has taken CS15 before:   


1) You are not supposed to search for a specific solution for your assignment on stackoverflow, but you can, however, search for the big ideas e.g. ""How do I instantiate an item in Java?"". Trust me, even those who seem really good at coding search these questions all the time as it's not necessary to remember all the syntaxes. 

  
2) Again, you are allowed to discuss with friends high level ideas. If you know how to do something in high level, it shouldn't be too hard to get down to the specifics. When you have an assignment-specific question, try thinking about how to phrase it at a high level. 

&#x200B;

3) Piazza are meant for clarification questions, and thus you will almost never get any direct solution for your project. Start your project on the release date. The lines at TA hours are not long at those time. Note that there will be occasional design hints on piazza though and it is worth checking everyday.   


4)  Don't wait for the help section before starting your project. Help section will help you most if you already know a great deal about the project. You should start, get stuck, then go to hours/help sections.

&#x200B;

5) The nature of the projects will begin to shift starting from Cartoon. If your problem is with calling functions other people wrote, you will no longer have such problem starting next assignment, as you'll be writing most of the code yourself

&#x200B;

6) DO INCREMENTAL CODING! Test each method you wrote specifically before testing the whole program. Don't ever try to write the whole thing and try to get it to work in one run. For example, you can start by trying to get the pane to show up, then make something happen, then add another part etc. 

&#x200B;

7) When in doubt about what a line of code can do, don't be afraid to start a blank java file just for testing it out. 

You can learn a lot from experimenting on your own too. 

&#x200B;

CS15 is challenging, but also very rewarding, as you'll be able to do very cool stuff by the end of the semester given that you don't drop out from the course first!

As much as it is a pain in the butt. Go to TA hours and just sit and work while waiting. You can also ask other students about general ideas. At least in CS17 you aren‚Äôt allowed to copy but you can discuss at a high level. For the small details such as initiations or object oriented design ideas definitely consult the Internet. As the semester goes on you will start to learn the cs thought process and will become a dramatically better programmer very quickly.

\- Tons of people don't have a specific passion when they get to college - and many of the ones who do find something else and switch. So don't sweat that at all, and definitely take the opportunity to explore a broad range of options.

\- Don't put too much weight on first impressions. By all means try your best, but it's also very common for social circles to switch from the people in your unit or whatnot to people in clubs / academics / who you meet elsewhere after the first semester or two. So don't let it get to you if you don't feel like you connect right away.

\- Early to think about this, but I'd put in a recommendation for BOLT (Brown Outdoor Leadership Training, I think). It's at the beginning of Sophomore year, but involves spending a few days camping in the woods with other rising Sophomores. It's a good way to get to know people on a deeper level and go into your second year with an extra little community.

\- Another thing to look into might be social housing - in addition to frats/sororities there's also program housing like tech house, art house, etc. which cluster around particular interests or scenes and might be a good way to meet people on a less superficial level.",3,,False,e1e5gh6,False,False,1530123326.0,2018-06-27 13:15:26

Depressed in the summer and not really looking forward to college or any of what it entails. 

In high school i had a small group of friends that i kept close and really failed to interact beyond that. I wanted to talk to more ppl, interact, be social and speak up, but i always condemned myself to a solemn and lonely silence only to be brought back from the edge of despair by the few friends that i did have. Now i'll be moving 4 hrs away from home while the rest of them stay at home for college. It stinks, leaving behind everything that i love, everyone whom i care for just for fucking college. I really don't care to dorm with someone else, ive always preferred being alone. Maybe its shyness, social anxiety, or depression idk.

The girl that i love, my unrequited love, is going to Georgetown in the complete opposite direction from NY. There's nothing i can do about it but swallow the truth and move on: that she doesn't care for me as much as i do her, as she goes on to find someone else and fall in love with another dude.

I hate it. This disgusting pitiful feeling that accompanies reality. Kimochi Warui, truly. 

My parents are making me focus on stem and engineering even though what i truly desire is english, writing, and creativity. Sure i can kinda do both but it's just not the same. I really don't like math and science that much and idk how im supposed to do it for the rest of my life.

Im not here to give you advice or sympathy, because as a person in a similar position sympathy is not what helps it's knowing that you're not alone in your struggles. That just one more pitiful soul over yonder knows and feels your pain and deprivation. That's real.

"""How Colleges Stop Depressed Students From Returning To Campus"" - article on an ongoing medical leave readmission case at Brown",142632061523,"This article brings up some really important questions regarding Brown (and all university) related mental health illness. However, the root challenge is society's views of mental health illness and consequently people may feel compelled to hide it, which just makes administrators even more suspicious. While I certainly am no legal expert, I think I always hear the narrative from the perspective of the students who have been on leave (and the experiences certainly sound shitty), and I would be genuinely curious to find out what the legal risks are for an institution if a student ends up returns to campus and harm himself or others?

I agree that Brown, higher-ed, and society must discuss mental health issues to understand it. Yet, I am not sure I like this case (and while I think the broader issue needs to be advanced and that this individual case isn't the most important). ""Dave"" certainly seems to be on a vendetta, and as someone who met this person once and shared mutual friends who continued sharing stories of said person's exploits, I am not sure I would have wanted this person back on campus if I was an administrator.

In 2011, a friend of mine was subjected to an involuntary medical leave and a group of us rallied, gathered signatures for a petition calling for increased transparency in the process, and met with then president Ruth Simmons. More information was made available on the health services website but has since been taken down. Currently digging through old files for more information on that whole process...

Honestly the scariest thing about this new BuzzFeed article was how familiar the descriptions of Dean Suarez's responses were, particularly the lines:
""Suarez tried to answer Dave‚Äôs questions, but seemed irritated by most of them, and appeared eager to get off the phone as soon as possible.""
""Suarez called Dave ‚Äúdemanding‚Äù and said she wasn‚Äôt sure ‚Äúwhat the point‚Äù of the conversation was.""

The case I am familiar with was completely different from Dave's case in the article, but those lines convinced me that not much has changed since 2011. I think focusing on Dave's case is really missing the big picture, that the procedures behind mandatory medical leave are opaque, byzantine, and likely counterproductive.

Applying to Brown (pre-med or PLME),FireRatz,"I know a couple PLMEs who don‚Äôt really want to go to medical school at Brown, so they are thinking of trying to take all the other classes other premeds take and go somewhere else. Not exactly sure what that process looks like or how the administration views it. I would also be weary of applying to any program that locks you in for a while (8 years in this case) because most people change their minds about their interests before college is done.

The biggest advantages of PLME, which I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre familiar with, are that you don‚Äôt need to take the MCAT or Organic Chemistry 2. If you have some pretty good research experience from high school, or something else that makes you stand out for premed-like programs, you have a decent shot. I will say it‚Äôs highly selective though. In my opinion it‚Äôs not worth it because you‚Äôll go through a rigorous application process just to bar yourself from other opportunities after graduation. Odds are if you‚Äôre smart (or lucky) enough to get into PLME, you‚Äôre smart (or lucky) enough to get into better medical schools or other post-graduation opportunities.

In general, the premed community is alright. There are a lot of opportunities to volunteer at hospitals in Rhode Island and I can speak from experience when I say Clinica Esperanza is a really cool opportunity (especially if you have any Spanish). Research experience isn‚Äôt too hard to get, but it can be a bit of a pain to contact PIs (as is the case pretty much anywhere you go).

In terms of classes, the big premed ones are CHEM 0330, 0350 and 0360 (gen chem, orgo 1 and orgo 2 respectively). They‚Äôre hard, but what makes them really suck is the collective premed stress. Everybody seems to be venting all the time and I personally get tired of it very quickly.

Take all my advice with a grain of salt please. None of it should help make your decision it should rather vaguely inform your decision.

Course Recommendations,strettopia,"Writing rec is the EASIEST thing to fulfill. If I could offer any advice, I wouldn't look for classes just to fulfill the rec, you almost definitely will accidentally and you might as well take something that interests you (in the spirit of the Open Curriculum). To give you an idea, while I'm probably going to end up pursuing an IC in the humanities, I study CS-Econ and fulfilled my WRIT requirement three times over in my first year. 

Dean Zia in his navigating the Open Curriculum talk during orientation always suggests exploring something you've never studied before as early as possible. Plus, with only one class, you can shop as much as you want. I shopped 13 courses first sem and 12 second sem‚Äîthere's no reason you can't shop more and just end up taking what seems interesting. While it may be a bit tougher as a first year, I should note that prerequisites at the school are often seen more as suggestions and if you reach out to profs directly can often get out of them. 

Freshman seminars allow you really close interaction with faculty in really interesting courses. Depending on what you study, you may not get courses of that size until you're a junior or senior. 

This is a long way of saying you can't really go wrong! Explore! Take something that interests you! No need to worry about concentration requirements or WRIT reqs this early in your Brown career :)",12,,False,g0ln1nr,False,False,1596744469.0,2020-08-06 15:07:49

Calc 1-3 are all offered this semester, and so is lin alg (pre req for APMA 0350). CSCI 0111 is also offered this semester; it's a ""simpler"" version of CSCI 0150 from what I understand.

If you're interested in the biology track for APMA, I'd suggest CHEM 0330 (gen chem) or PHYS 0050 (calc based physics). Both are challenging but interesting classes that are useful for the track. If you're interested in the economics track, ECON 0110 is a prereq for a lot of the requirements. Note that CHEM 0330 and ECON 0110 are usually offered every semester.

If you are considering APMA, I suggest taking some of the prereqs now. It largely depends on which path you do, and I am not as familiar with pure APMA, but the prereqs usually take more time and effort than the high level classes. If you can take multi calc (if that‚Äôs needed) or get straight into APMA 350 (you really need to check which requirements you‚Äôll have), that‚Äôs the best path in my mind.

taking five classes/sem as a CS major,IgorTheMad,"Hey , I'm just a first year (intended cs/math concentrator) and I'm wrapping up my first term taking 5 classes: CS0220 (math/cs), CS0180 (an intro cs course), MATH0200 (Multivaraible calc), MATH1010 (real analysis), and CLAS0660 (History of Byzantium).I would definitely say that my course load was overwhelming this semester, especially since CS220 is known as one of the hardest CS courses.  I came in and really wanted to ""do it all"" (I'm really interested in Classics, CS, Math, and Chem), but I this semester I felt spread-thin and really wished that I could get more out of all of my classes (I didn't feel like I had enough time to really internalize or enjoy the material in my classes). That said, here is my advice:

I think that taking 5 classes per semester is \*doable\*, but  be smart about it. It doesn't hurt to try taking 5 classes, but definitely choose a few to take SNC, AND be prepared to drop a course if you need to (I dropped Chinese my first semester). There is no harm in trying to take 5  classes per semester, but just be prepared and check in with yourself about whether you are feeling overwhelmed.

PS: I'm just as first year, so I would prioritize advice from more experienced people. I have also heard that Introductory courses are sometimes the most time consuming (I hope so) so it may actually get easier to take 5 classes as you go on (I'm not sure how accurate that information is, so if someone else has a better idea, please chime in)",11,,False,fp4rvmk,False,False,1588305840.0,2020-04-30 23:04:00

 2) You‚Äôll make it work and start taking 5 classes every semester and the CS department will kowtow at your feet. 

Either way, just go for it. They allow you to drop precisely so you can do stuff like this. And that is why you‚Äôre at Brown, isn't it?",10,,False,fp4wv5r,False,False,1588309517.0,2020-05-01 00:05:17
taking five classes/sem as a CS major,IntingPenguin,"Don't. Tried, burned out horribly. You'll find that instead of getting ""everything you want out of the open curriculum"" you end up getting nothing you want, because you're stretched so thin that you can't enjoy any of your classes much less all of them. 

**However**, this might be one of those things that you just have to find out the hard way yourself (I got the same advice you're getting now lol - everyone coming into Brown thinks they're hot shit but it turns out when everyone here is hot shit no one is). So, if you're hypothetically going to do this **very ill-advised thing**, here's how to come out of it with minimum damage should you prove to be like the remaining 95% of us and not the 5% savants who eat 2000-level courses for breakfast: 

1) Make sure your lifestyle is on lockdown. You better be a super healthy eater and sleeper, ideally with some good exercise habits as well.  2 CS courses plus likely a math and whatever else you load up with is no joke - you'll need to be in top condition. 
2) You better be a god at time management. Have all your course slots and TA hours and due dates plotted out at least a month in advance. Stuff can easily slip through the cracks when you're juggling 25% extra work than normal. If you have bad procrastination habits, this is your big red flag to abort.
3) Have an exit plan. Designate your ""5th class"", the one that you will drop without a shred of hesitation if things are looking hairy. Even if you keep this class, it should be S/NC. If things are in doubt, **do not be greedy** and try to keep the course. You will flame out in all of your classes instead. 

If you heed only one piece of advice in this comment, make it #3. I cannot emphasize this enough - you do not want to burn out badly because it wi hurt all of your long term goals.

taking five classes/sem as a CS major,quetzal1234,"The one semester I did 5 classes one was an audit. Maybe you could go that route?

I actually went the opposite direction to you. I took a medical reduced course load one semester ( I had  some extra credits for reasons we won't get into). For me, my quality of life was so important.

I'm also going to echo other people who say that summer internships are really important to get a job after college. You have to have work experience in your field, even in cs.",3,,False,fp5dbbh,False,False,1588325098.0,2020-05-01 04:24:58
taking five classes/sem as a CS major,itisntimportant,"""Dont"" pretty much sums it up. No academic advisor will look favorably on planning to take 5 classes every semester. Firstly, I believe that you are limited to 40 total credits within 8 semesters (could be wrong on that), so taking 5 classes every semester AND summer classes might not even be hypothetically possible, much less the best way to spend your time. 36 total credits could be enough to get you both a bachelors and a master's degree through the concurrent masters program and even that is extremely uncommon.

Practically speaking, you probably won't be able to get everything you're imagining right now out of the open curriculum even taking five classes and might need to reprioritize. You might be giving yourself an extra class per semester but that is likely to come at the expense of time that would be better spent getting the most out of 4 courses or exploring extracurriculars. Employers are much more likely to care about the quality of your work, depth of study, and internships than the degree to which you explored other interests, particularly if you are not trying to complete multiple degrees.

It is totally possible to take five courses one semester and not have a problem, but there will also likely be semesters where even four courses feels overwhelming. My most difficult semester by far was not either of two I took five classes in. Some classes at Brown require many many more hours to complete than others, and it can sometimes be difficult to determine that time commitment beforehand, particularly if you are trying to plan a completely full schedule years in advance. Course requirements and offerings change, and schedule conflicts can be a serious problem.

By all means, try taking 5 classes and see how it goes, but do it cautiously at first and take a fifth class you know to be relatively easy. Put all of your due dates and tests for the semester on a calendar at the beginning and make sure that you won't have like 5 finals in a row or multiple projects due at the same time. Take one (or more!) of the courses SNC, particularly if you know your required courses that semester will have a heavy workload, and be prepared emotionally to drop the fifth course early on if you find your performance in important classes takes a hit. If you're starting to struggle with five classes by midterms things will likely be much worse during finals.",4,,False,fp508ap,False,False,1588312244.0,2020-05-01 00:50:44

ENGL 1050A: Narrative

ECON 1210: Intermediate Macroeconomics

CSCI 0160: Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

MATH 0100: Introductory Calculus, Part II

PHIL 0010: Place of Persons 

Was doing pretty well but struggling in CS at the beginning of the year, partially because this is a pretty easy five compared to what a lot of other people are discussing. By the time I got home from COVID I could not keep it together and completely burned. First semester next year will 100% be a four class semester. 

I think I'll probably do 5 courses / sem again, probably as early as second semester my sophomore year. That said, I think you have to make sure to spread them out by department/discipline, and I'm intending to take probably 2 of them S/NC. I study CS-Econ; second semester might be, for example:

HIAA 0860 

PHIL 0360

CSCI 0220 (S/NC)

ECON 1301

ECON 1350

Some of these classes, intentionally, are on the easier end, and honestly the more time I spent trying to make this list, the more I realized I will almost definitely stick with 4.

First, the majority of Brown students are extremely wealthy. According to the New York Times, the median Brown student comes from a family with an annual income of $204,200 ([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/brown-university](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/brown-university)). 20% of Brown students come from families whose incomes are in the top 1% of all US household incomes. 50% of Brown students come from families whose incomes are in the top 5% of US household incomes. 70% of Brown students come from families are in the top 20% of US household incomes. 

This is not ""typical"" or ""normal,"" even by US collegiate standards. It means that, when you walk into a classroom or a dorm, you're likely going to be surrounded by mostly very wealthy people. I often felt really alienated in this kind of environment. 

That being said, Brown does create spaces for first generation and low-income students. The U-FLI Center is a great resource, which I'd recommend you check out ([https://www.brown.edu/ufli/home](https://www.brown.edu/ufli/home)).

Math Department Placement Exams,IgorTheMad,"540 is offered in the fall and is the only prerequisite to 1010 which is taught in the spring (at least this year). That combination would work fine, and 540 doesn't have any prerequisites, so don't worry about that. (I'm a freshman currently in 1010 and took 540 this fall)

I general, if you are worried about specific classes with these math classes as prerequisites then I would email the teachers of those courses. They can probably get you in. If you are more worried about  getting credit for the courses that you took, then I would email:   **calcplacement@math.brown.edu**  or [dkatz@math.brown.edu](mailto:dkatz@math.brown.edu) who is the placement adviser for the math department.

Is there any way to negotiate ED financial aid award?,conjjord,"I negotiated for RD; our significant bargaining chip was offers from other schools, but they *have* to be need-based only since Ivies can't consider merit.

Is there any way to negotiate ED financial aid award?,JDogLD,"I'm in your position right now. I received my award letter near Jan 10th because I was missing a couple of documents and I was stupid and didn't apply to any RD schools thinking that it will be good, right? It wasn't good because the net price was \~$16k above our EFC and NPC. Though I did get accepted to a few EA schools, their award letters haven't come out yet, so I'm still waiting to negotiate the price by comparing it to other schools, however, they aren't near IVY level so I'm not getting my hopes up. 

I first called them and asked for a reason for the higher net price compared to other students in my income range. They said my assets were heavily considered and told me to email the office with an appeal letter. I've emailed the FA office two times. The first time, they reduced it by \~$6k, however, the second time they didn't change it all (bruh). I would first call the FA office with your parents and explain your situation together. Then I would write an email about your situation and especially your need if they say so.

Currently, I've contacted admissions and they are working on it. Contact admissions if the price is unaffordable and the FA office isn't doing much.

I'm going to give you the same advice that the admissions person gave me: don't withdraw any of your applications - don't let this scare you, it's only a backup plan.

Is there any way to negotiate ED financial aid award?,throwaway32190209318,"I was in your exact situation last year - accepted Early Decision, with the award being noticeably less than what I expected through my EFC and their financial aid calculator (although it wasn't as big a difference as yours). I was able to appeal twice and got $4,000 extra total. It literally completely depends on your financial circumstances: for me, I was able to show that my parents have way fewer liquid assets than would be expected for someone in my income bracket. The documentation I included in my first appeal were bank statements of all my parents' accounts from the last year, and that got me about $2,000 more. Later, after I took out a small student loan, I filed another appeal basically just asking for more money in light of the fact that I took out a loan; I didn't include any new info, I just reiterated everything I said in the last appeal and said how more money would help me take out fewer loans in the future. That got me another $2,000.

It's definitely doable, and there's literally no reason to not file an appeal. Given the massive disparity in your EFC and your award, I would do it ASAP - that's a pretty serious discrepancy, and one that they would surely understand you talking to them about. My experience talking to people in the financial aid office has been extremely pleasant, they really want to do everything they can to help.

- Why haven't I gotten any followup emails yet?

We won't send out emails with possible matches until there are at least five participants who match your sexual preferences. So far, we have an overabundance of straight-cis men, and not enough people to match them with! Spread the word to people who _don't_ match that description!


- Do I need to be a senior to sign up?

Absolutely not! Although the traditional name is ""senior"" scramble, we welcome any Brown student to sign up.


- Should the photos I send in be explicit?

How you choose to represent yourself to potential matches is entirely up to you.


- I have ideas on how to make this a more worthwhile experience. How can I help?

I do understand however that they represent an additional networking boost, and pooled resources for big parties that otherwise probably wouldn't happen.

What are the best perks of the open curriculum that aren‚Äôt always explored a lot online.,JJKKLL10243,"The key thing to understand Brown is that it asks its students to take center stage in the learning experience. Brown expects its students to be active participants in their own education, and to actively seek  knowledge across disciplinary boundaries as well as to acquire the fundamental knowledge and analytical skills needed for success in their chosen fields. This makes for an exciting and profoundly satisfying educational experience, especially for students with confidence,  intellectual curiosity, and focus. However, it's also one that might be  overwhelming for students who prefer more academic structure and  direction. Brown's programs inherently demand a great degree of  initiative and self-direction. You should give this aspect of Brown careful thought as you consider whether to apply to Brown.

The following is from Jason Becker, class of 2009.  He was one of  four student representatives on the Task Force on Undergraduate  Education, which is a committee which was started by the Dean of the  College as part of our reaccreditation process which is seeking to be  the most thorough review of the New Curriculum since it began here at Brown.

&#x200B;

>It¬í's an egregious error to consider the Open Curriculum a means of avoidance. This is a major gripe of mine ¬óthose who proclaim the Open  Curriculum as wonderful because you don'¬ít have to take subjects you¬íre  not interested in. The negative statement, while true, is not the design  intent and not the way the Open Curriculum is actually used. The Open  Curriculum is designed for academic EXPLORATION. It¬í's about seeking out  the very things that drive your passions for learning. It¬í's about  seeking out challenges in new, sometimes quite uncomfortable, territory.  This is, in fact, how the New Curriculum is most often utilized by  Brown students. Despite the horrific statement that the New Curriculum  is great because, ¬ìYou¬íll never have to take math again!¬î Over 50% of our students will take a math course in their first year at Brown. The number of students who fulfill a ¬ìdistribution¬î (two courses in the  social sciences, two courses in the humanities, two courses in the  sciences) hovers around 95% each year. In fact, despite what some try to  claim, it is humanities concentrators who are least likely to fulfill  this distribution (87% do). The New Curriculum is not, never has been,  and never will be about avoidance. Despite poor advertising of this fact  by the Admissions Office and even some current students, people don¬í't  come here for the ability to avoid, but for the ability to explore. I  myself, as a physical sciences concentrator with the maximum number of  science and math requirements (21), have taken courses in 13 different departments over the course of 4 semesters.  
>  
>If students are to truly explore areas that are uncomfortable, unsafe,  new, and interesting, there needs to be some protection from this risk.  So many students are so grade conscious that they do in fact attempt to  avoid difficult challenges at the university level ¬óthis is true at many  institutions with cores, and it¬ís amazing that some people try and  forget that fact! At Brown, since the focus is meant to be on the  students learning, not on the students assessment (assessment exists  primarily as a means of feedback between professor and student, student  expectations are known to the student and they can assess if they have met  those, the grade is simply an indication of the professor¬ís assessment  of the student¬ís performance based upon the professor¬ís expectations),  the idea was to use a pass/fail system to encourage students to move  into fields never before explored by them. Not worrying about a  multi-tiered, sophisticated grading mechanism, students were able to  explore and learn based upon their desire to engage the material. It¬ís  not about making the course easier (by design S/NC is meant to be used  in an area where a lack of experience means it¬íd be difficult to have  any level of considerable success compared to more prepared students),  it¬ís about removing the pressure (external and internal) of earning a  grade and replacing that with the elation of learning a new and exciting  area. It¬ís about alleviating the fear of a physics student who¬ís always  wanted to study Faulkner but is fearful about being placed in a course  with English Literature concentrators. Some people would argue that a  core removes this problem, since students are forced to ¬ìexplore¬î.  However, it¬ís the free form exploration provided at Brown to engage in  any class in any area at any moment that makes this more pertinent. None  of these courses are being taken by people who need to be there. They  are filled with people who are there because they have particular  interest in the subject material. These people have strong experiences  and prior knowledge, and are often already building the skill set of a  disciplinarian. This is not the case in a core requirement and thus has  the ability to greatly change expectations (both of students and  professors), environment, and of course, the anxiety associated with  that course.  
>  
>The Open Curriculum gives students the ability to experience what it¬ís  like to be a disciplinarian in a subject area they a¬íre not experts in.  Many times students who are taking courses out of their subject areas  choose not to take introductory schmorgasboard type courses, but rather  seek to engage material first from depth, not breadth, and gain a wider  prospective from the study, in detail, of a particular microcosm in that  field. This is quite unique since most places require more survey type  course work as you spread yourself across the various disciplines at a  school. Having the ability to work first in the area of depth provides an interesting set of knowledge and insight, and often, I feel, provides  a student with stronger ¬ìmodes of thoughts¬î skills. They¬íre much more  capable of taking the knowledge and depth they¬í have gained on a small  subject area in the discipline and apply those tools to other problems  in the discipline. The course you take will not be an introduction to  the terms of say, an anthropologist; rather, it is a course in which you  must think as an anthropologist to even have modest success. Many Brown  students step up to this challenge. By learning to study an area in  depth, from inception to analysis, provides a more complete toolkit then  an introductory survey of information, and while this opportunity  exists at other schools, Brown is unique in presenting them in such an  easy fashion to its students. Students taking these courses do not only  have different expectations from professors than those in introductory  material or required core course, but they¬íre also surrounded by a  different breed of student¬óan essential part of the learning  environment.  
>  
>What¬í's wonderful about the Open Curriculum is clear to anyone who views  choice as empowerment and a responsibility they¬í are ready to take on.  Brown students have a task which students most places do not have¬ó they  need to be mature enough to take on the task of designing their own,  coherent liberal arts education curriculum. This is a responsibility and  power that Brown students tackle heads on. There is a whole culture  built around this. It¬ís quite a powerful thing to say to someone that  they are mature and responsible enough to seize their education by the horns and direct it appropriately for them. It is, in my opinion,  rightly determined that there are a significant amount of students in  this country and abroad that have a very good idea of how they would  like to shape their education. It¬ís empowering and allows for some of  the most unique educational experiences anywhere in the world. This is  not for everyone. *THE OPEN CURRICULUM IS NOT DESIGNED FOR EVERYONE.*  There are plenty of merits to other curriculum types and this subject  has been intensely discussed ad naseum through out academia. But, the  Open Curriculum is one such model which has served Brown quite well for forty years¬óour students come out better for it, and we build our class  around students we feel can best take advantage of an offering like the  Open Curriculum. Every applicant must fill out a, ¬ìWhy Brown?¬î essay, it  and comes as no surprise that many mention the Open Curriculum. It¬ís  what divides our institution and our students from many others out there  and makes this place unique.  
>  
>Brown students have a really unique opportunity when they arrive here.  Is there some room for abuse? Yes, though not much¬ó there aren'¬ít courses  designed to give people As (other than maybe 2 or 3 out of several  thousand), and people do leave here not having stepped up the challenge.  This is true at any university, however, and is typically quite easy to  spot no matter where you come from. However, there is a significant  portion of the student body here at Brown that could not do what they  did here anywhere else. That¬ís a powerful opportunity we¬íre offering to  students and one which accounts for quite a bit of our popularity¬óthe  ability to do something you cannot do anywhere else.",12,,1566054911.0,ex6jjxa,False,False,1566046728.0,2019-08-17 07:58:48

Other than that, don't worry too much about something like class rank. The admissions people are more concerned with you as an individual, and your performance and essays and personality as a whole, than about how you compare to your classmates. Grades matter because they are a decent proxy for effort/achievement over a long time, but not because there's some magical GPA cutoff or class rank. If you tend to get good grades in general, have your extracurriculars in order, and write good essays that really show who you are and what's important to you, then minor fluctuations (especially because of extenuating circumstances like you have!) and how your GPA compares to your classmates' shouldn't have too much of an impact.

As for showing them how much you love the school - be yourself! It seems like you have several good reasons to love the school, so talk about those! Maybe pick one or two that stand out the most to you, or find a theme among them that unites them (like ""diversity"" - ok, maybe a bit more profound and less buzzword-y than that) so that you can talk about them more in-depth and cohesively.

There's a little stand with picture instructions right when you step on, and if you're getting on near Brown the bus driver may expect a Brown student to need a bit of guidance, but it's literally just a swipe. You'll hear a beep and then you're good to go on. As you approach your stop, you can pull the stop request cord, or you can anticipate certain stops always being stopped at if you can't reach it.

Nothing else really to know other than your route -- I like the Transit app because it shows multiple possible routes in comparison, and you can open the app and see which lines are close to you without having a destination in mind. Also, don't think that you need to take the bus to explore PVD!

Resources for conservative students at Brown,theLucubrator,"It's great that there's spots for exchanging ideas but the people who are attracted to Brown and the professors and professionals who've invested in this place have created one of the most liberal Ivies. If you're headed here with the intention of fighting this current, you may want to consider whether your approach is respectful to the institution and the people who care about it, and you may want to ask yourself if this is the right place for you. What are you trying to get out of your college experience?

Resources for conservative students at Brown,ettuyeezus,"So I'm posting as a dyed-in-the-wool liberal who literally carries a DNC membership card. And I think it's not only respectful, but entirely in line with the mission of higher education in general, to actively foster *respectful* opposing voices on campus. I like to believe that our professors are trying to create a maximally inclusive institution, not an echo chamber.

I agree, if you're trying to make your conservative politics your entire college experience you'll probably have a bad time. None of these groups are big enough, even collectively, to do that for you. But I think it's totally natural coming into college to seek out clubs and people that you can immediately relate to somehow. I'd imagine babyfrosh want to go somewhere they can discuss politics without immediately arguing. And I would so much rather they have resources to hear educated conservative voices than leave them alone to start shitposting on The Donald. 

The campus is, definitely, overwhelmingly liberal. And a conservative student coming to this campus has to be prepared for that. They'll need to be ready to participate in creating an inclusive environment for *everyone* else here, regardless of their race/gender/sexuality/religion/age/politics/past, etc.

But if they're conservative, and thinking about attending Brown, they probably already thought about that. I like that they're throwing themselves into a hotbed of liberalism, and I hope (regarding the specifically political groups in my post) having these conservative spaces where they can have comfortable, respectful conversations keeps them engaged with the non-toxic parts of the conservative political sphere, and keeps them from resenting campus life as a whole or thinking of Brown as an echo chamber.

He was a first-year doctoral student in the Physics program known for his passion for Condensed Matter Physics. As a teaching assistant, he relished his interactions with our undergraduate students and garnered glowing evaluations. At Columbia University, he was a Rabi Scholar. The Rabi program enables ""outstanding students of science"" to engage in research with Columbia faculty during the summer. Hyoun Ju received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia in May 2013.


We extend our deepest sympathies to Hyoun Ju‚Äôs family, friends, and all students, faculty, and staff in the Department of Physics.

Ray Kelly Discussion,holyfudge0831,"I understand why the protesters did what they did. I understand why they felt the need to shout him down. I understand the atrocities and the racist viewpoints that Ray Kelly embodies. 

However, I still don't think what the protesters did was right in any sense. Brown University is well known for being a campus that holds the intellectual in the highest regard, a place of free thinking and a community widely tolerant of opposing views. 

Think of the long term consequences. What power do we, as a community of Brown students, have over Ray Kelly, a person of extreme privilege? Shouting him down accomplished nothing for us and ultimately, it has served only to discredit our student body and paint us as hypocrites. 

Letting him speak does not mean Brown agrees with his view points...but instead it gave people a chance to really talk to him and ask him pointed questions in an academic manner. To the point where we start taking away fundamental rights from HUMAN beings, is the point where we're no better than them. Free speech is a guaranteed civil liberty.

Ray Kelly Discussion,,"It was announced a week ago that Ray Kelly would come to Brown Unviersity to give a speech on public policy. A group of students promptly organized a petition to prevent Ray Kelly from speaking. Although the petition did generate a lot of supporters amongst the student population, the petition was denied. In response, students organized to protest the speech yesterday afternoon. Footage of the protest can be seen here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=6Qch6b7GaJM
As protesters began to voice their opinions during the speech, they highlighted the irony in Commisioner Kelly demanding civil discourse in spite of his promotion of blatantly oppressive and racist policies. University officials shut down the speech after thirty minutes, and Comissioner Kelly left campus. This prompted a campus wide discussion on the issues as Brown students gathered in Alumnae Hall this evening in an open discussion with Christina Paxson. 
Some highlights from the discussion:

Prof. Tricia Rose applauds yesterday's student protesters: 'We often forget how much courage it takes to stand against the status quo.' She added, ""I don't think this is a small issue from a fringe group. It ""might've been better if we had been able to fully challenge his positions, but at the same time, we know his positions. how much time do you give to those who always have the mic?""

Jenny Li '14, read the University's collective statement 'Asking tough questions is not enough. Brown is complicit.'
""Community organizing is never easy. And while some of you may disagree with the tactics ... we are definitely reflecting, we're talking to each other about what happened. I don't want you to think that we're sitting back and saying that 'we won.' We also won, but we're going to *continue* to win.""

Middle East Studies Dir. Beshara Doumani: ""There are many ways to have a conversation on campus, and yesterday's was one of them"" 
""We are privileged to be here because we get to play and take professional risks in four years in a way that we'll never be able to again. Every understanding of free speech and academic freedom that I go off of is a double edged sword."" 

Various students would continue to chime in:
""It is a privilege to be here. I'm a first generation college student, I'm a woman of color, my family immigrated here, I'm working class, I AM an intellectual... but I still recognize that it was a privilege for us to invite Ray Kelly to speak. So we are not denying his right to free speech, we are denying his right to stand on a podium and spew hate speech.""

""When one person's rights are violated, all of our rights are violated. When those protesters did what they did, I feel like they were protecting me from having my rights violated. The fourth amendment protects us all. I don't want my school to lend legitimacy to criminals""

'I did not feel physically safe to be here when (Kelly) was speaking in front of 2 rows... reserved for police officers,' a student said.

""I cannot let Ray Kelly speak on this campus, where I came, when I deserve to be here and he does not.""

""What I saw last night was really inspiring""

The Director of the Taubman Center would eventually apologize, especially to the students of color who were hurt by Ray Kelly's arrival on campus.


The protest spurred a REAL conversation that students admin and faculty wouldn't have otherwise had. Although some are embarrassed, I, for one, am proud of an institution with students that are courageous enough to stand in the face of political injustice.

Can anyone tell me anything about Intramural dodgeball at brown?,jchiang,"Played a bit last year. I don‚Äôt know how much you know about IM sports at Brown in general so I have a quick pragraph below about signing up.

Signups: For all IM sports we sign up on [IM Leagues](imleagues.com). There will should be an option for Dodgeball and Create-a-Team (if you‚Äôre making one, otherwise you can register as a Free Agent or get invited to a team with friends). Dodgeball, if I remember correctly, was divided into a Low level and High level, and although there was only one time slot available last year, you can usually see available time slots for the sport-level combo you‚Äôre looking at and sign up for one of them. There‚Äôs probably a fee for the team, and I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs around $30. You will need at least 4 to make a team, and there‚Äôs probably a max too.

Rules: Rules can vary based on who‚Äôs the referee, but here are the essentials. A game is 5v5 (maybe 4v4 sometimes?) and played on a badminton-sized rectangle. Balls start lined up in the middle. Referee counts down. After you grab a ball from the middle, there‚Äôs a middle line (I think the badminton service line) you must retreat behind before you can throw. Must throw within three seconds or so (just be reasonable) from your own half (if the other team has one player left, you can advance as far as their middle line). If you‚Äôre hit, you‚Äôre out. If your throw gets caught on the fly, you‚Äôre out. If you catch a throw on the fly, a teammate who is out can re-enter. If you leave the rectangle to dodge, you‚Äôre out. Usually, you aren‚Äôt allowed to leave the rectangle regardless, so you‚Äôll need to have substitutes/people who are out/designate one person to retrieve balls that leave the rectangle for you. First to eliminate all opponents wins the game. First to win 2 games wins the set, first to win 3 sets wins the match.

Competition level: I believe I played Low level last year. A handful of teams for some reason never showed up. The undergraduate teams I played against were good competition, but the graduate teams were just simply bigger and stronger than me so I was no match. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs generally a fun time, just make sure you clear with the ref beforehand what his or her ground rules are because like I said, they weren‚Äôt super consistent last year.

Hope this wasn‚Äôt too much info at once, feel free to ask anything to follow-up or clarify!",11,,False,ft8qsog,False,False,1591508009.0,2020-06-07 00:33:29

prospective ed,linkprovidor,"Brown has an excellent reputation when it comes to entrepreneurship.  There are a fair number of companies that started out as class projects. As for the open curriculum, I know a guy who studied geology and got a job investing. Wall Street just cares if you know and can apply the math.  He ended up having great insight into which oil companies were overselling their potential yeilds from specific oil deposits and doing pretty well on that.

Brown's culture in general is very inclusive and chill. I have friends who were winning national entrepreneurship competitions and were friends with a variety of anticapitalists at the same time. (I don't know about if Brown added a new preprofessional business program, when I was there it was the entrepeneurship thing.)

Idk about the preorofessional club scene other than that there are definitely opportunities for that.

All the upperclassmen in the club have interned at Goldman/BoA/PWP/whatever so I assume Wall Street placement post grad is pretty good. 


I will say that if you're very upfront that you want to do Wall Street, people will generally think you're a bad person. Maybe keep it on the down low.

Personally I advocate for basing decisions like this off of academics. We go to college for academics, so if you are sure about CS and come to Brown, you don‚Äôt have to doubt your decision later on.
I was also weary of big class sizes. But I have found having 2 big classes and 2 small each semester is a great balance. College is hard, and it is nice to have classes where you don‚Äôt have to worry about being called on/participating in lecture.

However, as a California resident who has visited both schools (I go to Brown now), I gotta say, Pomona's location will not give you the best possible California experience. It's in a hot, dry, suburban corner of L.A., super far away from the beach or most other interesting things to do.

Should you go to Brown, you'll still be the same person and you'll probably end up in roughly the same place. I can't really speak to med school personally, but plenty of people from Brown end up at the same banks and consulting firms as Harvard students, just like many high-performing students from lower ranked schools do as well. 

A HUGE thing Brown has going for it is the open curriculum. I discovered that I wanted to study biology in my junior year, and because of the open curriculum, I was able to add bio as a second major really late in the game. I guarantee I would not have been able to do that snd still graduate in four years had I gone to a school that has general education requirements, and I probably wouldn't have dipped my toe into bio in the first place had it not been for the ability to take any course S/NC.   

If grad school is on your radar, Brown students place VERY frequently into top grad schools.

Support systems at Brown?,mint-ish,"I can only speak for myself. College has been kind of difficult for me, and yes there were (and still will be, looking at this trend...) many times where I felt hopeless, lost, or stuck. For each time, there were different people that I felt helped me through, either emotionally or practically. Sometimes it was Deans, sometimes it was specific professors, sometimes it was my previous boss/Brown staff, sometimes it was my friends. Most recently, it was a mix of a few. For each time though, I do think I had to do some proactive work on my part - either by just going to Dean hours, seeking professors at their office hours or emailing them, dropping in to chat, going over to a friends' place. I think nobody can perform magic - just know that something's up and rush to your side - but many, many, many people are here to offer their support and advice without judgement and are rooting for you, a lot more than you would expect while you're feeling down. I do think that this may feel different if you are ufli/poc/intl though, or may be more difficult to feel.

I definitely think Brown is super alive! I love walking outside and seeing people sitting on the green or playing frisbee, or in dorm lounges talking to friends and doing homework, or looking at the posters or FB posts for plays coming up.

Support systems at Brown?,mint-ish,"I do feel like Brown doesn‚Äôt create a very tight knit first year culture compared with other schools. For example, Stanford has structural things in place so that freshmen dorms are a big community group; and then you have places like Yale where you literally live in the same hall for your four years. So in comparison, I‚Äôve always felt the university does not take it upon itself to really squeeze people together, if that makes sense. But maybe in comparison to high school or living at home, just the fact that you are living in a dorm, on a meal plan, will help. 

During the first, second semester, everyone is beyond eager to make friends, you mostly make friends through your dorm or classes, and you don‚Äôt have that many other commitments, so it‚Äôs easy to keep up. But pretty soon you‚Äôll likely realize, college friendships differ from others in that you really need to put in a lot of time and effort to maintain them, Everyone‚Äôs all over the place, doing way too much at once. But ‚Äúmaintaining‚Äù can just be grabbing lunch once a month or studying together sometimes - people start to understand friendships are much looser.

Downsides to Brown ED and Providence Area??,Ultracheesecake1,"The beautiful thing about Brown is that since we are an undergraduate focused University, research positions are very easy to get because there is little competition between graduate students and undergraduate students. This means that even as a freshman, you would have a really good chance of landing in a good, established lab due to your previous experience in biochem research. Opportunities are definitely plentiful, you just have to ask around and email professors. Most of the time if you give interest in their research, if there is room in their lab, they will let you in. In addition, the Brown shuttle goes to four hospitals very close to campus so shadowing, and volunteering should not be that big of a problem.

&#x200B;

Providence is interesting. I would describe the city as being very indie probably due to the fact that RISD is in the center of Providence. It is definitely not a New York or Boston kind of city and is a lot more chill. There is honestly too much to do in Providence but Boston is a train ride away so if you ever feel bored, a lot of students go to Boston on the weekends all the time since its a big city. 

&#x200B;

The Brown Campus is a little wack. Brown has streets that run through a lot of the campus, meaning that buildings are smaller and I thought that it would actually feel less like a campus, but that is definitely not the case. The campus is pretty beautiful in my opinion but buildings are basically brick or concrete. The dorms are okay. They are definitely not the highlight of Brown, but they accomplish the job. For instance, a lot of seniors and juniors live off campus because Brown is in the middle of Providence so it is easy to rent.

&#x200B;

Providence is really close to the water so in my opinion, the weather is better than places like Boston and definitely better than Upstate New York. For instance, last year, we had at most like 15 inches of snow over the entire winter while Boston had significantly more. Upstate New York definitely has worse winter weather. This is not to discount the fact that Providence still has a Winter. It definitely gets cold and snows, but the weather is generally pretty good in Providence compared to even upstate Mass.

Downsides to Brown ED and Providence Area??,clarabellum,"Can't speak to pre-med stuff, but oh man I love PVD so much. It's such a weird little city, with better food and better culture than anyone would expect for its size. And if you start really missing the big city, Boston is only an hour away (but MUCH colder -- proximity to the ocean makes Providence a little more mild). I stayed in providence for three summers, and during two of those I had internships in Boston, so going back and forth is very doable. I used to go to concerts in Boston all the time.

That said, your first couple years, you probably won't even leave college hill much unless you really make an effort. Campus keeps you pretty busy.

So are there bad things about campus? Absolutely. You will find things to complain about as soon as you arrive. Almost all the places that were shitholes when I was a student have been renovated since then, so I don't know what we're dunking on these days (keenasty RIP), but there are still definitely some gross buildings. And like, big weird art is gonna show up from time to time and you will have to decide whether it is dumb weird art or Actually Good weird art. And sure, Sayles is beautiful, but it's very much not wheelchair accessible. et cetera.

(I hear they're working on the accessibility thing, which is the only one of these problems that actually feels worth solving. Otherwise, you're on a college campus - everyone's going to bitch about the facilities once in a while).

But like....... you'll love it. It's wonderful. Untitled (Lamp/Bear) is GOOD. TF Green is a good airport! Fox Point is upsettingly charming!! Wow i'm nostalgic!!!!",4,,False,eu5b6c2,False,False,1563473793.0,2019-07-18 13:16:33
Downsides to Brown ED and Providence Area??,acetrainerelise,"As a current premed: Health Careers Advising is an assembly line. We have damn good medical school admissions rates (it was like 92% recently), but they will try very hard to steer you into being a certain type of applicant and won't want to go out of their way if you want to try something different. As an example, a doctor I'm trying to shadow wanted a letter saying that I'm a full-time Brown student in good academic standing and have good character blah blah blah, but premed advising told me that they ""didn't usually send that type of letter"" and to contact the registrar (who won't comment on my character). There are only 2 advisors for the 1000 or so premeds at Brown across all four years and alumni, so they train undergrads to answer common questions and tell you to go to Peer Health Career Advisors instead.  

I feel like it's hard to get to know your STEM professors until you start taking upper-division classes that don't have 100+ people in them. My humanities professors (shoutout to my wholesome and amazing advisor Lynne DeBenedette, who is a language instruction GENIUS) have been consistently phenomenal and I've made some great relationships with them.

A lot of clubs that actually look good on resumes are application-based, so if you don't get into them, you're kinda screwed for ECs unless you don't mind branching out off-campus. I got waitlisted for Brown EMS, so I'm buying a parking spot off one of my teammates so I can volunteer with a small Rhode Island town EMS company that public transport is too inconvenient to get to. 

The bad parts about campus is that the food gets real old real quick imo, and my biggest problem with meal plan is that there's no way to consistently be able to eat broccoli and green beans (my staple healthy foods that I love). The only good healthy food consistently available is Jo's salads, which kinda sucks if you're like me and not a salad person. 

Every dorm has a major upside and a major downside- for example, I lived in Wayland last year, which had gross showers and hadn't been updated since it was built 65 years ago, but was super close to the main green and the Ratty and had decently large rooms. 

Since Brown students only take 4 classes per semester and there are so many premed requirements, you'll have less free space in your schedule than you would think. I'd recommend going on [Focal Point](https://www.brown.edu/undergraduate_concentrations), [Health Careers Advising](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/health-careers/first-soph/pre-medpre-health-profession-courses), and [CAB](https://cab.brown.edu/) to make a schedule of your bare minimum requirements over the next four years to see how many free slots you'll actually have, but I'd recommend that for every college anyway. Take special note of which classes are only offered in the fall (Orgo II) and are only offered in the spring (Orgo I and Biochem). Also, you shouldn't S/NC any premed or concentration requirements unless it's mandatory S/NC (some English classes and Math 90), so don't get your hopes up about that.

Providence weather is moderated by being fairly close to the ocean (the coldest I remember it being on a daily basis was like 20-25¬∫ in February), but that also means it rains a lot. Not the ""it's 4 PM in the summer so it thunderstorms for 20 minutes and then it's fine"" type of rain or the ""there's a tropical depression so it'll downpour for the next 3 days and then won't rain for 3 weeks"" type of rain that Alabama gets, but like a fairly consistent raining all day every third day type of thing. Campus gets large puddles so bring rain shoes. Activities-wise, PVD is great, especially since every major tour ever has at least one show in Boston and it's so easy to take the T. Some really cool people like John Mulaney and Pete Davidson even come directly to PVD, too (I saw them, it was great).

These are my honest views of all of the bad things about Brown, but Brown is my favorite school in the world and I'm so happy to be here. I recognize the bad, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. The people on this campus are the most wholesome, interesting folks I've ever met, and even on horrible days there's nowhere else I'd rather be.",9,,False,eu4q4yk,False,False,1563460609.0,2019-07-18 09:36:49

In late January 2019, a severe cold wave caused by a weakened jet stream around the Arctic polar vortex hit the Midwestern United States and Eastern Canada, killing at least 22 people. It came after a winter storm brought up to 13 inches (33 cm) of snow in some regions from January 27‚Äì29, and brought the coldest temperatures in over 20 years to most locations in the affected region, including some all-time record lows. In early February, the polar vortex moved west, and became locked over Western Canada and the Western United States. As a result, February 2019 was among the coldest and snowiest on record in these regions.

Doubtful that this is about so-called private events. The office presumably takes care of arrangements when donors or trustees visit Providence to dine privately with the University president. 
Ultimately, this is a collision of Brown's diversity & inclusion posturing and the reality of the school being a private institution that exists, competes, and falters or thrives b/c of private patronage and privilege.

He paid out of his own pocket to get together those people Advancement Office is trying to reach. If you or your kid ate at the dinner, you are more likely to respond to fundraising solicitation. At least most people would pay for their fair share and maybe a lot more. The money is going to the school, not Granoff. You are shooting yourself in the foot. Brown has relatively small endowment and due to its small endowment, it is the last Ivy to abandon need-aware admissions. Someone has to pay. I don't have friends who are wearing expensive clothes but I am not bothered by what others wear either. Everyone has their own friend group. If everyone has to pay for their own full tuition, I won't be here. If those rich kids have priority at housing lottery, it would be a serious problem. But I am not bothered by others who choose to get out of housing lottery. You should go to Princeton to check out eating clubs there. Rich students are eating at exclusive clubs on campus. How do you feel about that?

I really feel people who complain about this don't understand they are the ones who are the beneficiaries of those events. Those super rich don't need to find jobs anyway. They are not competing with us in the job market. If we really want

Ultimately the university is concerned about the PR surrounding this. Regardless of how you personally view the dinners, it is objectively bad optics that the university's actions don't comport with its messaging, which was what led to the course reversal.

They're shrewd operators and could have explained their rationale for supporting the Granoff dinners perfectly well this week. Anyhow, so goes Brown.

A few questions about the party scene,card860,"1. Very accessible, especially on the weekends. Compared to other schools I've been at, parties are as open-door as you can reasonably hope for which is really nice. Basically as good as it gets.
2. It depends, and this isn't really something worth asking tbh
3.  you can probably find better summaries of Greek Life but I'll give it a shot at the end of this comment.
4. Grad center bar (GCB) is by far your best bet and is a pretty fun vibe. Alternatively there isn't much else that's mainstream bars-wise. (others can chime in here as I turned 21 right when we left campus this spring)

More on 3)

Male Frats:

Beta Rho: Mostly Jewish, some chill dudes, mostly white, not too fratty, rumors are they're getting suspended for some mild stuff and some of the bhrothers are considering starting another similar frat that's going to be similar but ""improved"" lol

Sigma Xi: The most WASP-y, rich, attractive, think Exeter and the traditional rich white d-bags. They throw solid parties and some of the guys are chill though, others are insecure pricks ymmv. Also they are kicked off campus  (light hazing and a bad coverup job) so you'd have to run in these crowds nowadays (not that you didn't before but it's slightly harder).

Lantern: More lowkey, rumors of hard drugs. Generally has a pretty chill group of dudes that are more mild and tolerable compared to SigXi

Delta Phi: Lax frat, otherwise pretty hard to get in unless you play club or another varsity sport and are good friends with some of the dudes

Theta Alpha: See DPhi but for football

Delta Tau: Lol, they get a bad rep for throwing some mediocre (read few girls) parties but I think the guys are generally good dudes. Pretty big on weed too if that's your thing and its not too competitive to rush this frat

Beta Omega Chi: Frat for Black/African Americans, pretty chill vibe, definitely check out if you identify with that

Sororities:

Kappa Delta/Kappa Alpha Theta: KD most closely fits the rich white girl typical sorority stereotype, but ymmv.

I think KAT is more exclusive than KD (although I heard that's debatable), I don't know enough of the differences between KD and KAT as they can be very class dependent so you'll learn for yourself!

Delta Gamma: Larger than KD and Theta, more asian but plenty white, definitely a fun more relaxed vibe and easier to get into imo, but is big

Alpha Chi Omega: Has had some struggles getting girls to join and stay but overall is a solid group with a solid housing spot lol

Mixed:

Zeta Delta Xi: Probably your most LGTBQ+ greek org

AD Phi: A mixed vibe with generally nerdier

Tech House: Techies?, don't really know much tbh

Buxton: International and/or rich people for sure. But more broadly it's kind of a mix between lantern and a london international school. Chill vibe but also a very strange recruitment process and is toxic. Also coke. Also they're kicked off so the asian american greek org is in their housing area on wriston (see below)

AA: idk much about this either, but seems like a chill group similar to BOX",16,,1593974305.0,fwff9ex,False,False,1593478856.0,2020-06-29 20:00:56

Winter Clothing Recommendations,citro-naut,"Hi there!

I just weathered my first RI winter after having lived in FL for my entire life, so I hope my perspective helps. I usually walked to school every day throughout winter so I feel like I got a pretty good taste of a mild RI winter. 

Generally, RI gets pretty mild winters with low temperatures rarely dipping below the teens. This past winter we got two or three snows that left more than an inch of snow. Some winters in recent past have produced much more, though! But in general, the weather is mild and gets more mild every year. I was perfectly comfortable with jeans + leggings/long johns + long socks on the bottom and a cotton sweater + heavier shell on the top. I splurged and got a patagonia outer shell that is actually meant for snowboarding, but it's perfect as an all-season all-weather jacket. It had an extra layer of that nano-puff lining, which really helped. For boots, I picked up a pair of waterproof Halley Hansens that were on sale. 

From my experience, four definite recommendations:
1. Get a nice and thick waterproof jacket. Whether you get a shell with insulation or one big beefy jacket, you'll need something to keep you warm, break the wind, and to hold up in the rainy/snow conditions. 
2. Get waterproof boots. No compromising here. 
3. Get a scarf! I always thought they were more for fashion but omg what a difference a good scarf makes. 
4. Get a good pair of gloves. You won't need heavy duty leather gloves but the cheap cotton gloves from Target won't do much for you. Get something in the middle. 

There are TONS of folks here that wear Canada Goose but it is entirely overrated in my opinion. If it's not Canada Goose then it's Patagonia, North Face, or one of those other outdoor brands like Arcteryx. You're going to have to spend somewhere between $150‚Äì$400 on a nice jacket but anything more is vanity IMO.",14,,False,ftbpr8i,False,False,1591579386.0,2020-06-07 20:23:06

Winter Clothing Recommendations,vegansasquatch,"When I went from SoCal to upstate NY, the two most helpful things I got were:

Waterproof boots. I bough L.L. Bean boots because that‚Äôs what was recommended to me, although they were a bit expensive. Visit REI to search through their outlet website and you can find something cheap that works. You‚Äôll want thick socks to go with them, too, so keep that in mind while you‚Äôre sizing your shoes.

A two layer winter coat. Mine is Northface. What‚Äôs great about a two layer winter coat is that you can take the very warm fleece liner out and wear it on cold dry days, wear the waterproof shell on warmer wet days, or combine the two for those cold wet days. Don‚Äôt buy anything more than $300.

I never wore gloves. I brought a knit beanie that I bought from a surf shop back home and decided I needed something warmer once we got in the 20s and teens. You‚Äôll be able to find a wool hat somewhere around town, but don‚Äôt worry about It until you need It. Also recommended some kind of neck gaiter that you can pull over your nose.

Help me decide! Brown vs. Dartmouth,poeteac,"Greek life is marginal. If you want to participate, you can find an enriching and loving community, but it does not dominate social life. 

The open curriculum is my favorite part about Brown‚Äî is like our beloved child (second only to Blueno). If you‚Äôre unsure what you want to study, it gives you the chance to explore before deciding. If you are sure, you can go ahead and stock up on your concentrations recs. It‚Äôs compatible with anybody who is self-driven and won‚Äôt cop out by taking the easiest classes all S/NC‚Äî generally, if you got into Brown, you probably aren‚Äôt that student. 

Don‚Äôt know much about Hanover, but PVD is my ideal college city. It‚Äôs quaint but urban. Great food w J&W next door, accessible transportation, nearby beaches and parks if you want to be in nature, Boston an hour away if you want to be in a larger city for a day, the river was 3 minutes away from my dorm last semester, and College Hill is gorgeous. 

RISD and Brown are tight! It‚Äôs harder for Brown kids to take RISD classes than vice versa because RISD classes take up huge chunks of time and it can be difficult to work it into your class schedule, but if you make it a priority you can easily do it. There are many partnered organizations (magazines, art/performance groups, etc) that are open to both institutions which is neat. Befriend RISD kids and eat at the MET ;)

Help me decide! Brown vs. Dartmouth,HappyPenguinInc,"- Greek life isn't as big at Brown as it is at Dartmouth. You can absolutely join a fraternity/sorority, or other types of themed houses, but it's not a central part of most people's experiences.

- Talk to your advisor about the Open Curriculum and how it would work best for you. What worked for me was figuring out what classes I needed for whatever concentration I wanted to do at the time and take 2 or 3 requirements per semester. Then fill the rest of your cart with classes that seem fun or interesting. Brown is all about going outside of your comfort zone and trying a class you'd never have done otherwise. For example, I took a class on Ancient Egyptian Religion and Magic, something I know nothing about, and it was one of my favorite classes at Brown.

- I don't know much about Hanover, but Providence is very connected to other cities, particularly Boston, and NYC.

- Brown is very connected to RISD. I would suggest taking VISA100 in your first semester here, which will allow you to take RISD classes. The downside is that RISD classes don't always fit in Brown schedules well, so you'll have to deal with that on a case-by-case basis.

- As I said, I don't know a ton about Dartmouth, but I believe they're both excellent schools that offer different approaches and environments to your education.",8,,False,fn3rfsi,False,False,1586626468.0,2020-04-11 12:34:28
Help me decide! Brown vs. Dartmouth,thepwnager1337,"It should be said that I do not have first-hand experience with either school (another ‚Äò24 applicant) but I will sort of explain my choice of picking Brown. 

For one, Greek life is MASSIVE at Dartmouth. Estimates put about 60% of its entire undergraduate class in some Greek organization. This was a big minus for me as I was 1) not interested in Greek organizations at all and 2) didn‚Äôt want to pay expensive dues to have an active social life. Even my alumni interviewer admitted to me that a great number of social gatherings revolve around Greek organizations and that not being affiliated with them would make participation ‚Äúdifficult.‚Äù 

Secondly, the dorming situation at Dartmouth is historically bad. There was a post on their sub just a few months ago titled ‚ÄúTo incoming '24s, for the sake of current students, please reconsider coming here‚Äù detailing this. With Dartmouth‚Äôs famous D-plan, a lot of housing has been heavily disrupted due to the COVID outbreak, and that situation will likely carry over into next year. Housing shortages and quality are quite sub-par at Dartmouth, and while Brown is certainly not the best in that regard, it is definitely a step up. 

Lastly, it depends on what kind of college experience you are interested in. While I plan to go pre-med, I am extremely interested in art and Brown allows me to explore that (at one of the best art schools in the country mind you) without feeling as though it is a detriment to myself or my curriculum. Additionally, while Dartmouth has a pretty campus, it is really isolated, and I would personally much rather have the slightly more urban experience that Brown provides (which I think strikes a nice medium between accessibility and scenery). 

It is always up to you, but after talking to some students on campus, I have never been more sure of my decision.",5,,1587024417.0,fn4kxrn,False,False,1586643500.0,2020-04-11 17:18:20

I picked Brown mostly based on gut instinct - it was my favorite from the beginning - plus a few random things that I preferred (semesters vs. quarters, open curriculum which was better for premed and better for my random other interests such as taking language classes unrelated to my concentration).

Help me decide! Brown vs. Dartmouth,inkycosmos3,"Hi! I was deciding between the same options last year and here's what made me choose Brown

\- The Open Curriculum: I also felt kind of daunted by the Open Curriculum, but I've found that there's a ton of support around to help you make decisions about classes. From advisors to professors to older students to DUGs, and online resources such as Critical Review, there are many places to go for advice on planning and choosing classes. Also not having distribution requirements honestly takes a lot of stress off the already stressful process of planning classes. 

\-The location: when I was applying to colleges I thought that location wouldn't be important at all, but I was wrong. When you end up having free time, its really nice being in a city that's near two other major cities, Boston and NYC, than being in a small town that doesn't really have access to any other place.

\-The schedule. Dartmouth is on a quarter system and Brown is on a semester schedule. On the quarter system, it's pretty rare to be at home at the same time as your home friends. Also after talking to students at both colleges, I found that I found the pace of a semester-long class better than a quarter class.",3,,False,fn4syns,False,False,1586648291.0,2020-04-11 18:38:11
Help me decide! Brown vs. Dartmouth,fredelina,"Hey, I went to Dartmouth undergrad and am about to start Brown for graduate school. While I learned a lot and made lifelong friends at Dartmouth, as a progressive hippy art and anthro major I likely would have been happier at brown. Visual arts at Dartmouth has amazing funding and professors, but pretty mediocre students (a lot of frat bro‚Äôs taking the classes as electives). I was involved with activist groups at Dartmouth which kept me sane because the student body, while mostly cool, includes some vicious republicans and conservatives.

That said - it depends who you are. I think the happiest people at Dartmouth are those who love nature, are politically republican, center or liberal but not too progressive. The nature was phenomenal. I didn‚Äôt mind the small town since there was an active social scene (I hated frats/sororities going in, ended up joining one because everyone was, then quitting it haha).

Finally, my college years were very very fun, despite the imperfect fit, due to amazing friends (many were international students on financial aid - that Dartmouth policy was good!), so don‚Äôt stress the decision too much! 

Feel free to dm me with any follow up questions, obviously at the moment I know more about Dartmouth.

Help me decide! Brown vs. Dartmouth,laneyday,"Hi!!! Dartmouth was one of the schools I was thinking about before choosing Brown.

I chose Brown over Dartmouth because community was the most important thing to me in figuring out where I was going to school. Some students I met at ADOCH are still my friends today. The organizations I am apart of have been so supportive in my times of struggle.

Help me decide! Brown vs. Dartmouth,OrangeLlama,"1. What other people have said. I'm not in greek life, I've never even been to a frat party, but I know some people that are active members of sororities and frats. To socialize, it's often a big party or a couple big parties. Might be a sports house, might be a frat house, might be a small concert.
2. I also don't think I'm the ideal student for the open cirriculum, but as long as you're aware of that, you're fine. You just have to be actively making the bolder choice to take a class in another department that you may feel less comfortable in.
3. Personally I think Dartmouth takes the cake here -- I think I would much prefer to live in a smaller town with beautiful nature around it. You'll have the rest of your life to live in a city. Providence is fine, I personally don't go out into the city often, but College Hill is still beautiful and isolated.

Help me decide! Brown vs. Dartmouth,WheatGerm42,"1. Greek life exists, but it‚Äôs pretty minimal. A big fraction of our (already small number of) frats/sororities are also unconventional and pretty dorky. If you‚Äôre into the whole animal house thing, there‚Äôs not really much of that here. Most socializing is done through social cliques and extracurriculars. 

2. I wouldn‚Äôt let the open curriculum intimidate you too much. Every concentration you‚Äôd take still has its fair share of requirements, though some have more than others. I think it‚Äôs important to have a vague idea of the direction you want to go with your academics, since you won‚Äôt be exposed to every field like in a core curriculum. The flexibility can be helpful in giving you a chance to explore exactly what you want, but that means you have to know what you want. That said, you‚Äôll have a year or so to figure that out after you get here.

3. Providence has many more basic amenities than Hanover. It‚Äôs not a big city, and it‚Äôs fairly boring as far as cities go, but you‚Äôll have access to pretty much anything you‚Äôd need. Lots of restaurants, a big mall nearby, etc, etc. Hanover is gorgeous, but it‚Äôs not as convenient.

4. Yes, the connection really is that strong! I‚Äôm a Lit Arts major and I have RISD students in half of my Brown classes. You have to take a prereq course  to take courses at RISD, but it‚Äôs really quite easy from what I hear. There‚Äôs also a lot of socializing between the two schools ‚Äî my girlfriend goes to RISD and about half of the students working on my student publication go to RISD. The arts at Brown itself are pretty underfunded, but the connection to RISD all but negates that. Anyone I know who‚Äôs serious about visual arts is heavily involved with them.

5. Dartmouth and Brown are pretty different, but at the end of the day they‚Äôre both still great universities. Dartmouth is a much more conservative and traditional college experience, and is definitely the right choice if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for. Brown is quite a bit weirder culturally and structurally, but most folks here still have a pretty typical college experience. I love Brown and I‚Äôm so glad that I‚Äôm here, but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be happy wherever you end up.",1,,False,fn3tks2,False,False,1586627646.0,2020-04-11 12:54:06

Brown v. MIT??,cats_and_wines,"One thing to consider is, Brown is very undergrad focused. At Brown, undergrads are little over 2x the size of grad population. At MIT, grad population is little over 1.5x undergrad population. What this means is that professors at Brown often have very small research groups (like 1~5 PhD students per professor) so finding research groups is very easy and you get a lot of individual attention from professors. Some of the professors I met at Brown have become my strongest advocates and I will eternally be grateful to them. I'm now heading to Stanford for PhD where grad students are little over 1.4x undergrad population. I'm personally very satisfied with this trajectory because I get to go to undergrad focused school for undergrad and grad focused school for grad.

As for friends, I made some of my closest friends while tackling psets together! In Brown's math program, you will also discover the joys of pset parties!! This was the case for me in my math and physics classes. Also, Brown's math department in particular, I would say, is pretty tight knit (check out Friday Math Tea sessions if you end up choosing Brown!). I made some really great friends through the math dept even though I'm physics.

Regarding academics, I think that Brown has quite strong pure math programs, although if you are looking to go more bio side, Brown has a fantastic Applied Math program! You can also venture into Biostatistics which is a separate program administered under the Masters in Public Health (but undergrads can take the courses. I myself took a statistical data analysis class in biostat program).

On a final note, I'm sure MIT students have great post-grad outcomes, but Brown students also end up in fantastic places! I didn't know many premed very well personally, but the three that I know ended up in Johns Hopkins, Columbia, and UChicago med schools. I know far more people who went to other grad schools, and the vast majority ended up in top 10 institutions (I can remember 1 Harvard Law, most common destinations from physics seemed like Stanford/Harvard/MIT, chemistry ended up in Caltech/Harvard, Princeton seemed to be a popular destination for CS PhDs, idk the rest), so I don't think you need to worry about how strong your research profile will become at Brown as opposed to MIT!",19,,1585517095.0,flv2wyz,False,False,1585515255.0,2020-03-29 15:54:15
Brown v. MIT??,conjjord,"I'm a freshman at Brown who, for most of the admissions process, thought MIT was the perfect place for me. I attended all sorts of events through high school and, at the end of it all, ended up coming to Brown. Two of my closest friends here turned down MIT for a Brown education, and while they're both engineering I can attempt to incorporate their perspectives.

I can confidently say no matter your personality or interests, you will find a rich community at Brown. People here are most definitely interested in late-night p-set parties, but that's discounting the wide variety of other passions that you'll find really intriguing even if they're not of a technical nature. It's an entirely different experience from high school no matter where you go, but I will say the undergraduate experience at Brown is truly unlike any other.

I won't repeat cats\_and\_wines's points, which I think are super helpful in portraying Brown's pros, but I will add a few of my personal experiences. I tested into higher courses in the Pure Math department, and have absolutely enjoyed my time in each class. For each subject there are both practical and theory-based options, so you can choose whether you want to simply calculate or explore the pure fundamentals behind each field. I'm concentrating in Computational Biology, which sounds like a better fit for you as we don't really have the same notion of 'double majors' here. It's a wonderful program and, within the Open Curriculum, it allows you to explore all varieties of math and biology, among others.

My quintessential Brown story is this: I came in definitely set on CompBio, and immediately wanted to take as many hardcore technical classes as humanly possible. But I was really into ancient history, and so decided to take an archaeology course on the side - a complete detour from my intended course of study. By the end of the semester, I had fleshed out an immense interest in ancient Roman economics, developed a great relationship with the professor and was even hired as an intern for his excavation site in Italy for this summer. Obviously, that's dashed because of COVID-19, but I think it goes a long way to show the nature of opportunities here at Brown. There are also numerous labs in Bio and CS, as well as teams in Math, conducting research and looking for undergrads.

I hope this helped - congratulations on your accomplishments so far and best of luck in choosing!",12,,False,flv9fwg,False,False,1585519138.0,2020-03-29 16:58:58

I don't know MIT obviously but I would imagine your experience is hardly uniform no matter where you go. Some semesters I have a group that I do homeworks with, some I fly solo. It's kinda just the way the ball bounces. Honestly, once you leave behind all the contrived school culture they try to shove down underclassmens' throats, your experience is largely what you make of it.

The one thing I can say is almost universally true about brown is just how much your interests will surprise you. I'd give you like an 85% chance of switching the bio major to like assyriology or contemplative studies or something within 4 semesters. It's one of those things that you sorta assume is a bullshit tour-guidey thing to say but it's completely reflected in reality.

Brown v. MIT??,rando13713,"Thoughts on the different types of people:
Most of the people I know from MIT come from backgrounds of high-level science competitions. They are definitely some of the brightest and most driven people I've ever met. Brown's student body is much more diverse in terms of their academic interests, for better or for worse. Personally, I was very drawn to this. As someone (probably) concentrating in Physics, I did not apply to any of the super exclusively STEM-focused colleges, because as much as I love physics, I want to be surrounded by group of people who can teach me and get excited about all sorts of random topics (including math and physics of course). In just my first year here, I have learned more about Art History, Italian, Jazz, Geology (you name it!!!), than I think I ever would have at a more exclusively STEM-focused institution like MIT. 
Brown has a great math program which attracts tons of super smart students, many of whom come for Brown's freedom of study and creative reputation. These guys are also happy to talk about their research and/or problems with people who aren't as knowledgeable, like me :) I have had plenty of late night chalkboard sessions, mostly concerning physics, and I know that the higher level math kids are into these as well.
I know that MIT is not just chock-full of kids who are only into math and engineering; they have awesome humanities courses there too. Each school has all sorts of people, and I'm sure you'd be able to find ""your people"" at either one. There will probably be more of those interested in the same kind of math as you are at MIT, but I don't think there will be a shortage of these people at Brown.

Thoughts on research:
A pure math concentrator that I'm friends with was able to find a research position in his first semester here, and I know people in many other departments have had similar experiences. I don't know about MIT, but Brown makes it very easy to get involved in meaningful research. On top of that, most of the professors here really care about their students, which makes more of a difference than you may think. You'll find ways to be challenged here in classes and research, so I wouldn't worry about that. ~~And if you ever do want to take a class at MIT, you can cross enroll in a class there (this works the other way around too!)~~ Edit: maybe not actually???????

As far as mental health goes: we've long been ranked as one of the happiest colleges in the US, not that this ranking matters a ton, but generally, most people seem to be super happy here. You are right that Brown students are generally humble and friendly. However, it can be a rough place sometimes, as any college can be, and there are lots of resources to help you out.

I would make sure to ask this question in the MIT subreddit because we may be a little biased :p I think you'll be able to find ""your people"", be challenged, and have a great experience at either of these places, so I don't think there's really a bad decision to make here.

Brown v. MIT??,TheEnemyOfMyAnenome,"Well I don't know a ton about the rock climbing community specifically, cept for a few tidbits. I had a good friend who was super into bouldering and seemed to have a good crowd here, though he ended up transferring to penn. There's the BOC (Brown Outing Club), they do cheap hikes every week via lottery which is an amazing way to meet people. They do Sunday Night Climbing too at a local rock gym, and since I have a car I've been enlisted to drive friends there too. That's all just to say that even among NARPs a lot of people are into it. 

On the subject of the great outdoors, there's also BOLT (Brown Outdoor Leadership Training) (leadership training part sorta incidental) where if you get in you get to go on this student-led 5 day backpacking trip the August before your sophomore year with a group of students you've never met. One of the best and weirdest experiences I've ever had, 100% beginner friendly though a little tough to get into and very tough to get in as a leader. I'd say total a few hundred kids do it.

I went to a very competitive high school so personally I found Brown a little lacking honestly at first, but I doubt you'd have that experience. There are definitely a bunch of rich or almost-rich kids here that are pretty boring, but when you start self selecting your peer group this place gets super sick. I would say it's not competitive at all really, much more collaborative in my experience, and perhaps not necessarily artsy in the way you're thinking. 

To give you a little synecdoche, during the quarantine I've been hanging out with some friends who have a place two doors down. We've mostly been reading & swapping books, playing Pandemic Legacy S2, getting high, playing a ton of Go, watching Avatar, working out, getting high, cooking, playing smash, sunbathing on their balcony, having weird incredibly far-ranging conversations, playing with tibetan singing bowls, skyping our therapists, and yeah my friend and I occasionally swap poetry notebooks. And he's also in two bands, one of which is named after a juice flavor from the main dining hall. And another kid there did a week long silent meditation retreat in house. And another is into like ceremonial hap√©. And another is studying arabic. And me and a few engineers were speculating how to mechanically model the vibration modes of the singing bowl while coming down off a shroom trip (look, when you're cooped up in a house for two weeks drugs get involved a bit more than usual). 

A huge chunk of this school across the board is artsy in some facet of themselves, it's definitely the culture. But that manifests in very specific ways. People are probably not the theater kids you know, except for the theater kids. But Brown sorta pushes or draws out people's interest in weird, specific things, which is probably the single best thing in its favor.",3,,False,flwzoqp,False,False,1585571009.0,2020-03-30 07:23:29

"What makes Brown special, aside from Open Curriculum?",itisntimportant,"They're asking you why Brown because they want to make sure you actually have a specific interest in Brown other than its reputation. Why do you want to go to Brown? Don't worry about anyone telling you to say this or say that, the best answer will be the most genuine one. A bunch of strangers on the internet will not be able to provide that, and if you yourself do not have an answer you probably shouldn't have applied. Everything you mentioned is a perfectly fine response - no interviewer is going to ding you for bringing any of those up, but they very possibly will want you to elaborate. If you just read out a list like that (which you can find on any college admissions board) and can't justify your interest under further questioning it will not go over well. They aren't looking for a one sentence response. All of that being said, the Open Curriculum is one of the most unique things about Brown, and something that Brown as an institution is very proud of. Someone applying to Brown who either doesn't know about or doesn't understand the Open Curriculum is not likely to impress an interviewer. If you go that route, find an interest and talk about how the Open Curriculum would benefit you specifically in that regard, don't just say something generic like you want the freedom to take whatever class you want or that you never want to take another math class.

Also, as a current interviewer whose mom also interviewed for Brown for 20+ years, the interview doesn't matter that much unless you enormously bomb it (saying that Brown is your bottom choice, being blatantly racist, etc.). We seem to have very little say in who gets admitted or rejected, the admissions committee is just trying to get to know you better. Relax and be yourself.

These interviews aren't necessarily meant to gatekeep but rather to make sure that potential students are the right fit for the school and that the school is the right fit for the student. Not every school/program is made equal. 

I'd recommend researching the city, the research opportunities, the culture, and the history of the university and find out what you like about it. It kind of sounds like you're putting the cart before the horse by asking why Brown is a special place after you've already applied. I doubt that's the case because you were obviously inspired to write a compelling enough application to get an interview. But again, just be honest. And if the open curriculum really was why you wanted to come then don't be afraid to say that. It really does make Brown a special experience but you have to justify why that matters to you.

Question about comp sci majors,rikena,"1. I would say around 10-15 hours a week, but that can rise depending on things like TA hour lines, your class size, and how quickly you grasp the concepts, etc.
2. I haven't particularly used the alumni network, but there are undergraduate CS clubs, especially for minorities that are really helpful. In my experience, talking with CS upperclassmen is super helpful for finding more information about classes & jobs.
3. Yes definitely! I didn't have much experience with CS before coming to Brown, and entered the 15/16 track.
4. Yes, I'm a joint concentrator in cs-econ. If you're interested more about the joint concentrator, feel free to PM me.

Question about comp sci majors,LiveSpin,"1. For me personally, it's 15-20 hours per week, but my path is unusual because I started as a sophomore and did the bachelor of science degree, which has more requirements. So, I took 3 CS classes per semester for 4 semesters in a row, and the vast majority of people take 2 or fewer classes per semester.

2. Yes. I've heard of people using it to get referrals to companies from recent graduates who are working at companies they are applying to. I've done this too.

3. Yes. All of the intro classes start from the beginning and assume no prior knowledge.

4. Yes. Double concentrations are supported by Brown and plenty of people concentrate in CS and something else.

5. None of the classes are designed to weed out people. Most people who drop CS drop it in their first semester or when declaring their concentration. I recommend CS 173, CS 147, and CS 32.",1,,False,fcctd12,False,False,1577602396.0,2019-12-29 00:53:16

Why Brown CS,MachoTaco178,"I answered a similar question in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrownU/comments/b922ng/brown_vs_penn_for_computer_science/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) so I'll just paste in what I put there!

""
 Hi OP!

&#x200B;

I study CS at Brown, so I hope I can help!

&#x200B;

First, for some background on me. I began Brown not knowing what I was studying, and I found myself drawn to CS. I had never coded before, and the intro classes were challenging, fascinating, and rewarding, so I went for it. I am now a junior in the program.

&#x200B;

My CS experience includes: undergraduate research, TAing 2 courses, Head TAing 1 course (next semester!), and competing in [Hack@Brown](https://2019.hackatbrown.org/). I also landed an internship at Google for this summer, in part thanks to Brown's preparation!

&#x200B;

Here is my sales pitch for Brown CS (in no particular order):

* The faculty is absolutely fantastic. This is a small subset of the faculty, for the full list see [here](https://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/).
   * [Andy Van Dam](https://cs.brown.edu/people/avandam/): Inventor of hypertext
   * [Anna Lysyanskaya](https://cs.brown.edu/~alysyans/): ""Developed \[and proved\] a practical way for people to securely log in to websites without providing any identifying information... \[relying\] on 'zero-knowledge proofs.'"" ([source](http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr35/profile.aspx?TRID=618))
   * [Tom Doeppner](https://cs.brown.edu/~twd/): Creator of one of the first Unix threading libraries
   * [Shriram Krishnamurthi](https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/): With his grad students made the first formal semantics for JavaScript
   * [John Savage](https://cs.brown.edu/people/jsavage/): ""ACM Fellow for 'fundamental contributions to theoretical computer science, information theory, and VLSI design, analysis and synthesis'"" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Savage))
   * [Michael Littman](https://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/): ""Elected as an ACM Fellow in 2018 for 'contributions to the design and analysis of sequential decision making algorithms in artificial intelligence'"" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_L._Littman#Awards))
* Undergraduate research opportunities:
   * The faculty is constantly performing groundbreaking research with undergraduate help. I personally have contributed to research. It was funded and I learned an immense amount. If you are willing to put in the work to meet with faculty, you will probably be able to land a solid research gig one of your summer's here!
   * Every semester there is an undergraduate research colloquium where every faculty member presents to the undergrads what research they want help in. This is awesome for getting involved and is how I ultimately met the professor for whom I researched!
* Courses:
   * The courses have immense breadth and depth. I am personally interested in Systems, and I have been able to take virtually every course in the discipline that I can imagine. The courses are generally difficult but rewarding.
* [Industry Partnership Program](https://cs.brown.edu/about/partners/) / Industry placement:
   * Students in Brown CS pretty consistently land solid internships.
   * Every semester a ton of companies recruit at Brown in the career fair (see above link for affiliated companies). The companies also host lots of events to network and learn about the industry.
* [TA Program:](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/ta/)
   * The TA program cannot be overstated. It has been one of my favorite parts of the department. It gives CS students the opportunity to teach their peers, bolster their resumes, and make money.
   * TAing has helped me master course materials, learn how to manage a staff, and refine course content.
   * TAing is also extremely impressive to interviewers! I discussed my TAing in some form in nearly every interview I had.
* [Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion:](https://cs.brown.edu/about/diversity/)
   * Though there is definitely room for improvement in this, the department is trying to make the CS program diverse and inclusive. I appreciate this immensely because CS as a field is very often homogeneous, and I like that Brown is trying to change that.
   * Some mechanisms they have for doing this include: mandatory TA diversity training, the hiring of [Diversity Advocates](https://cs.brown.edu/about/diversity/student-advocates-diversity-and-inclusion/) to support members of marginalized communities, and a yearly [Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0awowosa1d7rbm/2017-2018%20DDIAP%20Update%20Report.pdf?dl=0).
* The people!
   * I have made some lifelong friends thanks to Brown CS, and I wouldn't want to study anywhere else! The program is filled with passionate, caring, and brilliant individuals. I appreciate how the community isn't as competitive as some other CS programs are. The work is hard enough on its own, constantly competing with your peers would just make it miserable in my opinion.

&#x200B;

This only scratches the surface of the CS community and what Brown has to offer, but I hope it helps!! Feel free to followup and I'll try to answer whatever questions you have (:",21,,False,ekk0bf4,False,False,1554912072.0,2019-04-10 11:01:12

Just being able to speak to some of the cutting edge AI researchers does it for me.

Questions Not Answered In Brown Tour!,beepybeetle,"1. In my years at Brown, I've never encountered any sort of large scale event. That might be a combination of various factors ranging from ""I don't care"" to ""Different social groups"". I mean they must be kinda doing something since we have a sort of LGBT greek society, but even on that my knowledge is murky at best since I only have a single friend in greek life, and he's in sigma chi, which if I had to wager, is not lgbt-themed 
2. You'll run into some people who legit are classist as fuck. I have a friend who decided to stop talking to someone because the kid's parents weren't of 'good stock'. True story. Of course the whole canada goose meme circulates like the flu on the meme page, but generally, most people don't seem to give a shit and outwardly, will treat you with little apparent bias. That has just been my experience as an upper middle class asian dude. Your mileage may vary. But again, I reiterate that like 99% of people don't seem to *overtly* show any signs of classism or elitism. 
3. yeah I can't answer that. It's called like an 'independent concentration' or something like that and you'd very obviously need to work closely with the school to make sure you actually have a degree and not a piece of fancy toilet paper after your 4 years.

2. YMMV. Callout culture is pretty real online, but for the most part, people are pretty friendly and inclusive (at least outwardly).
3. I knew somebody concentrating in ""Conflict Studies"", and I believe the postergirl for IC's (independent concentration)  is ""Happiness"". You could probably do whatever you want as long as you had a cohesive plan and you aren't clearly trying to skimp on courseload. It's a lot of work though, or so I've heard. I would also suggest just picking an AB similar to what you're interested in and designing the rest of your curriculum as if it were an IC, since ABs typically only have like 10-15 classes anyways.
4. Open curriculum all the way! I don't take many humanities courses (unfortunately), though I've been able to explore many different disciplines within the sciences. But also, I think Brown is just a lot less stressful to be at than peer institutions. Echoing that some of the professors really do suck, and many classes are still pretty huge, but you can't really avoid that anywhere.",7,,False,eh30at4,False,False,1550896920.0,2019-02-22 22:42:00
Questions Not Answered In Brown Tour!,harryrunes,"These are basically all the questions I had when I was looking at Brown (except #3) so here you go:

**Question 1:** I'm bi and I was really hoping I could do a bunch of gay shit‚Ñ¢ when I got here. I was a bit disappointed though. While it is one of the most open and accepting colleges around, there aren't like massive events and you aren't really involved with queer culture if you don't actively seeking it out. But, if you put some effort into it, you can become part of a pretty established community.

Basically, it won't fall into your lap, but the community exists and is pretty open. There are also Greek orgs, gay bars etc. present on/near campus.


**Question 2:** That's really hard to say. There are a lot of rich people, and they do act rich. But, generally, they aren't bitchy about it. It's just frustrating to hear people talking about going skiing in Switzerland over winter break, etc. Basically, a lot of times they don't understand how rich they are. There is the occasional asshole, but they are few and far between.

But Brown is a diverse place and chances are you will find a group mostly composed of people of your same general background (some people might call that self segregation but you should tell them to fuck off). You probably won't run into any elitist people if you are not an elitist.

I will say, however, that I'm from a pretty rural area of Missouri (a ""redneck"" area), and do get a little bit of problems because of that (some people don't understand slang/my accent etc.) So I would say that people are a little bit discriminatory because of that, but that's mostly by people from Providence (I've had problems with a cafeteria worker for example, because he had a super thick New England accent and such), Brown students are very open though. I usually hang out with international students for this reason tbh.

And, keep in mind that it is wayyyyy better here as far as issues of discrimination of all types at Brown compared to other universities. It's just the ethos of Brown.

**Question 3:** I think that it's something that a lot of first years consider, but I don't think a huge amount of people actually do it. It seems to me that a lot more people do double ~~majors~~ concentrations because of the lack of gen eds (you have enough room to do two complete concentrations). For example, I want to do archaeology and applied math (applied math is called APMA btw) so I was considering making my own concentration, but honestly it makes way more sense to just do them both independently. Keep in mind that I'm just a first year tho, so I might just be talking out of my ass.

**Question 4:** I chose Brown for the general open and caring atmosphere. I don't think there's a single other institution with the same type of community (well grinnell maybe). I really love it here and I am very happy with my choice.

But, let me give you some other reasons why I would choose it, that I only discovered after coming here.

* small classes: to give you an example, I am in an archaeology class this semester with 3 undergrads (including myself), 2 grad students, a post doc, and the professor. I don't think that's something a first year student at many universities could say. I've only had one class with over 50 people in it, and most have been under 15 people.

* Accessible professors: this goes hand in hand with the small classes, but almost every professor has known my name. They really care about your education, and will meet with you any time, you just need to shoot them an email. Keep in mind, these are also professors at the top of their fields. Sometimes, they are the world's top scholar on the thing they're reaching a class on, and you can meet with them one on one! That's crazy to me, and while I'm sure you can do that at some other top universities, it's definitely something that can't be said for a lot of schools even in the top 20. It's also a lot easier when everyone is passionate about the class. Because of the open curriculum, the students care about the class material, and the professors know this.

* Shopping period/open curriculum/universal s/nc (pass fail): I had no idea about shopping period before I came here. Basically, it's like an add drop period on steroids. For the first two weeks, you can go to whatever classes you want so that you can get a taste of them before you commit to them. The open curriculum is of course a reason why I chose Brown, but I cannot overstate how big of a deal it is. I cannot imagine college without it, it is so integral to the Brown experience. And universal s/nc really encourages you to do  risky things. For example, I would have never taken Spanish if I had to have taken it for a grade.

* Good location: it is very easy to get to Boston (15 minute walk to train station, $12 train), and Providence is a beautiful city. Brown is also situated on a hill, so you get to look out over the city/river. The weather is also pretty nice. I was expecting it to be super cold/rainy but honestly it is way nicer weather than in Missouri. It's no California, but it's not very windy and they have massive snow plow fleets so they are really well prepared for winter weather.


Anyways, I am very happy with my choice and I don't regret a thing. Feel free to ask any follow up questions!

Questions Not Answered In Brown Tour!,sadiesweet,"1) We are really fucking gay, dude, although it might be the specific circles I hang out in over in Humanities. It‚Äôs a pretty big deal though and it‚Äôs easy to find LGBT+ friendly spaces on campus. 

2) Eh. I‚Äôm first gen and broke as fuck, so I‚Äôm hypervigilant to some of the classism on campus. Usually though it is in really small things people do or say and not anything big (excluding the girl who told me she was concerned because I was only eating ramen noodles and that ‚Äúfresh produce really isn‚Äôt THAT expensive‚Äù). Again, though, I‚Äôve been lucky enough to avoid the worst of it through my specific groups. 

3) Literally the sky is the limit as long as you can justify it to the university. It is a process, however, so you need to start planning early if you want to go that route. I knew someone who majored in some weird combo of neurology and education - so specifically mapping out how educational techniques trigger reactions in the brain. Idk, it was a lot when she talked about it. 

4) I chose Brown because I really hoped that having the Brown Name on my diploma would look good. No lie. They also paid for me to come visit the campus because I was low income which I didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to do anywhere else, and I loved the atmosphere and decided ‚Äúyeah sure, fuck it, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt change my college choice - I‚Äôve had more good experiences than not - but it‚Äôs definitely a rough environment as a first gen who came in with a lot of undiagnosed mental health issues (thanks, ADHD) that made socializing and finding a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù torture my freshman year. Just find a balance between work and social life, don‚Äôt be afraid to take classes pass/fail instead of for a grade, and go to clubs until you find something that sticks.

Questions Not Answered In Brown Tour!,southern_bonsai,"(1) as a grad student, I've found LGBTQ+ life here pretty dull compared to my time spent at comparable schools (two before this one.) I especially am disappointed that there does not seem to be much community for queer women on OR off campus, as I was hoping Providence might make up for what Brown didn't have, especially with RISD around, too. There are several bars that seem to cater to drag culture or to queer men, but there is no lesbian bar I have been able to find and no queer women scene in general. That has been a bit concerning both as a queer woman and as a grad student who might hope to find some of these communities off campus rather than just within Brown, but within Brown, even the best I've found as a grad student is an occasional meetup only sparsely (< 5 people) attended by usually freshmen/newcomers.

Questions Not Answered In Brown Tour!,harryrunes,"Some people go every weekend, some don't ever go, most will go about twice a semester. 

It's a quick walk (or very quick Uber) to the train station, then an hour train ride to get to south station, and from there you can take the T (subway) throughout the city. A lot of people go to concerts or shopping there.

Math 0100 Requirements,thespelvin,"Dan Katz here (calculus placement advisor for the math department, and teaching Math 0100 this semester).

Math 0090 is not coded into Banner as a prerequisite for Math 0100. It's a prerequisite in the course description, meaning you will need to know most of the Math 0090 content to take the course, but if you've taken an equivalent course elsewhere, you won't be blocked from registering. (Though you also won't retroactively receive Math 0090 credit for finishing Math 0100, so if you're considering courses or concentrations that require Math 0100, talk to them and make sure they'll accept 0100 as a substitute.

If you're considering Math 0100 without having taken the AP exam for Math 0090, you might want to take a look at the problems on our online placement exam. 

[http://www.math.brown.edu/\~calcplacement/CalcPlacementTestHome.html](http://www.math.brown.edu/~calcplacement/CalcPlacementTestHome.html)

If you know how to solve most of the problems in Sections A and B, there's a good chance you're prepared for Math 0100 (we also spend a week reviewing Calc I pretty quickly, though if you're thinking about adding now, you've missed all of the review and the first homework assignment, so it'll be a steeper hill than it would be at the beginning of the semester.",10,,False,g5o11gc,False,False,1600399338.0,2020-09-17 22:22:18

Advice for a prospective transfer student,princelavine,"I was denied regular and went to brown as a transfer my sophomore year. While transferring in is certainly a possibility, I‚Äôd suggest not going in with that mentality just given that your time in college is limited and that attitude will certainly be off-putting to someone who is probably (understandably!!) excited to start at Northeastern. Enjoy your first year; it‚Äôs a great school! 

Work hard and make meaningful connections with people. If at the end of your first semester you still think you want to transfer out, go ahead at full speed! Giving it your all will make the transfer process easy w/ good recs + first semester grades. 

I had a great freshman year at my old school but still knew Brown was the right place for me. I applied quietly and did not tell anyone until I got in. My friends were really surprised, but all very happy for me. I am fortunate enough to keep in contact with those people + my brown friends today. 

brown was a great experience. I grew into myself there. But be warned that there is nothing better than starting a school at the same time as everyone else. As with transferring to any school, it took extra effort on my part to get to know people and feel like I fit in. It‚Äôs doable, but you really may find that Northeastern is the place for you. My takeaway from everything is I could have very well stayed at my prior school and had a similar outcome but with perhaps less toil on my end.

I went to a great state school, which I wasn't excited to be attending at first; I had the idea of transferring in the back of my mind even before starting, which is a mindset that I regret having, because I it led me to have a really negative attitude towards my college. Things started to change as I got more invested in my classes and extracurriculars, but I still wanted a different school culture and a smaller student body so I could really feel like I was part of a community, so I decided to apply again this past year (also didn't tell anyone haha).

My advice is similar: aim for high grades, pursue your passions through extracurriculars, build rapport with professors, and start working on your essays early (I can't emphasize this last point enough; I procrastinated on my essays and ended up doing them during the school year, which was incredibly stressful when I also had to balance school and other activities. I should have finished my essays over winter break at the latest). I really hit the ground running during my first quarter, which helped me get good letters of rec and write my essays later. I also decided to apply sophomore year because I didn't think I was a competitive applicant during my freshman year, but I know that most transfers at other schools (I'm not sure if this includes Brown) are sophomores, so I don't know if it's more difficult to transfer earlier or later. 

I hate to say it, but I kind of had one foot out the door at my previous school, and only now after I decided to transfer do I realize all of the opportunities (mostly friendships) I missed out on because I was so keen on transferring. Don't give up on Brown, but also don't completely discount Northeastern. While I was waiting to hear back from Brown and other schools, I kept telling myself to ""romanticize my future"" at the school I was already at so that (1) I wouldn't be disappointed by admissions results and (2) I could appreciate everything my school already had to offer. Whether you end up at Northeastern or Brown, I'm sure that you'll have so many amazing, fulfilling experiences! Good luck!",3,,False,fsbpynm,False,False,1590859754.0,2020-05-30 12:29:14

AP Scores for Advanced Math?,thespelvin,"I think I might be able to help with this... I'm the Calculus Placement Advisor for the math department.  


Brown does have a policy to accept AP Calculus credit, which yields what's called placement credit. It's true that to some degree, this placement credit doesn't ""count"" toward your progression toward a math concentration. Placement credit doesn't contribute to the total number of credits you have to take at Brown, and it's true that our calculus/linear algebra courses don't have prerequisites coded into the registration system. We tell students to take Calculus I before taking Calculus II (which they should or they'll be VERY confused), but if they took Calc I elsewhere and don't have a test score proving it, they can still register for Calc II.  


But placement credit is still useful in that (a) it appears on your transcript, and it might be useful to future employers/schools to know you took calculus before arriving at Brown, and (b) more importantly, it satisfies prerequisites for courses in ANY department.  


Math is not the only department on campus, and there are courses in many other departments (for example, Applied Math, CS, Economics, Engineering, Physics) that have calculus prerequisites, and their approach to prereqs may be more formal than ours. So if you don't submit your AP score, you'll be able to take Multivariable Calculus, but you may not be able to take an engineering course without special permission from the instructor/department. Waiting for that permission can be a pain if registration is open and section enrollments are filling up, and there's no guarantee that permission will be granted at all. (Having taken more advanced math courses is usually enough to convince a professor, but it won't convince the registration system to let you in by default.)  


If students have a personal or economic reason not to take the AP exam, that's understandable; as described above, there are potential disadvantages to arriving without credit, but at least within the math department, we'll try to enable you to continue where you left off. But if you've taken the AP exam and have a qualifying score, I think it's a really bad idea not to ""bother"" to submit it. It'll show up on your transcript and unlock permission to take a lot of courses in other departments, and having those options is useful even if you don't decide to pursue any of them.

This might not be the case for all concentrations (sounds like the math department might handle this differently, which makes sense for math AP scores) but the scores definitely have their use in some circumstances.

I'd consider taking a look at RISD design courses, since you might be able to take a few. Those might be more focused on the design aspects than the CS design courses at Brown.

CS Design Pathway?,mint-ish,"hullo, sophomore in CS-Design!!

i'm curious what about CS-Design attracts you, and what kind of design you're interested in? 

the ""pathways"" themselves are pretty new (just started this format last year I think), so honestly CS-Design isn't that design-focused (imo). There's also a lot of flexibility. All requirements are CS-related requirements (so you don't have \~ design \~ classes like Color Theory or Design Principles for example, but you can choose to take a web development class which talks a little bit about ui/ux, or the most design-y class imo is CS 1300 ui/ux, which is a little coding but mainly teaches ui/ux, and is still a CS upper-level class). You still need to take intense CS-related classes like CS 33 (systems), CS 32 (intro to software engineering), linear algebra, or APMA 1650 (statistical inference), but you have, like all other pathways, some flexibility in which ones specifically you can choose (i.e. choose 2 out of the 4 -- if you google Brown CS requirements you can find the specific major and pathway requirements). Which I guess makes sense, since you're still getting a CS degree in the end like all other pathways.

HOWEVER, taking all CS-related classes also means even if you choose the ""design"" pathway you can still easily go into software engineering. You would have the necessary skills. Personally, that's also a reason I was able to so confidently switch to doing CS-Design as my major, because if the whole ux design thing doesn't work out, I still have the backing of a CS degree and can do SWE.

Brown itself doesn't really have a strong \~ design \~ related department - our Visual Arts department is very focused on art rather than design, our Modern Media and Culture department is about film and theory, and our Engineering department has one or two industrial design related classes but can require ENGN prereqs and are kinda bad looking at the course reviews. So yeah Brown doesn't have any cool Design Principles or studio classes. We're able to pretty easily register for RISD classes though, and obviously they have super strong art/design departments, including industrial/product design, graphic design, etc etc (you can google their majors as well!) so you could take those as supplements. However, RISD doesn't have a very strong ui/ux focus (I think only 2 classes? - so if the other school you're thinking of is RISD AND you're interested in ui/ux, I'd say brown is better).

For job prospects, idt any graduated seniors were doing this pathway structure then, but I do know a ton of graduates who are currently interaction or ux designers. Honestly I'd say the Brown CS degree is really employable. Again, the pathway is pretty flexible, so you can go into a lot of different fields imo... I'm interested in ux, which I think is super fun.

Another thing is if you're into ux, Brown has a good anthro department and psych/cog sci department (that's one combined department at Brown) so that's also really good for supplements in the design research/cog sci facet of ux.

finally, Brown CS A.B. is only 9 classes!! so you can take a hell lot of RISD or other CS pathways (Machine Learning? Data Science?) or whatever the heck you want, and still graduate with a CS degree :)

feel free to ask or pm me anything as well :)

CS Design Pathway?,mint-ish,"RISD classes: yes I have! RISD has a mandatory winter quarter that is chiller than its other semesters (it's supposed to be an ""exploratory"" semester for other majors and freshmen), and it's free to take it if you're willing to stay in PVD for a few weeks during brown winter break, as it'll count as one of your spring courses (which is fine, since our course cap is 5 per semester, but everyone only takes 4 anyways). I took one of their wintersession classes in their Industrial Design department.

I also was going to take their UI design class this spring, but had to drop it a few weeks in because I was too busy :( super sad face. you can find RISD's course catalog online as well, and this particular course was called ""Point, Click, Drag"" in the Graphic Design department, although the professor is in ID.

getting into RISD classes as a brown kid is a process but compared to literally every other school on this planet, it is SO much easier as a brown student. it's kinda crazy how we have this opportunity. (also, you do not have to take VISA 100 in order to take RISD classes, as brown's VISA department falsely claims.)

&#x200B;

internships: hmmm so I actually just switched to CS this year (sophomore), just figured out I wanted to do ux/what was ux last summer, and didn't really have any ux design work to show. all CS upper-level classes require the intro sequence as a prereq, so I wasn't able to take CS 1300 UI/UX for example (though I've heard you can finagle your way in if you want). however, I was lucky enough to take a product design class in the fall and put that in my portfolio, along with design research work from a club I'm in, and qualitative research from previous humanities classes. I did get a few interviews, passed a few, and also was able to receive a design challenge from Google. BUT, I applied to a LOT of places. I'll be working at a well-known company in the summer as a ui/ux intern, so it worked out - but I think in conclusion, it was rough because I didn't have any ux work, I wasn't sure start building a ux portfolio, and most places hire relatively few ux interns (esp compared to SWE) so they can be picky. However, if you already know you wanna do ux, you're like 2 years ahead of me!! you'd be able to pick more relevant courses early on, apply to underclassmen internship programs, and talk to people about getting ur foot in the door for ux. freshmen summer internships are always tricky for any major, but by sophomore summer i'm sure you'd have a solid ux portfolio.

HCI: Jeff Huang is the main professor who does HCI at brown!! he's the guy who teaches UI/UX as well, and he also teaches a grad seminar on HCI (which you can take as an undergrad if you want). his website is like [jeffhuang.com](https://jeffhuang.com). he's honestly one of the most approachable professors at brown. he has an [HCI lab](https://hci.cs.brown.edu/) and is really into getting undergrads into research (he's head of the research committee or something at brown, idk what it's called). he has a whole google docs on how to get into research for his lab, you should def check it out! I know undergrads have submitted papers and even first-authored them, to top HCI journals (I'm pretty sure these are all on his website too). I'm trying to get into his lab for next semester, hehe. although it def depends on your skill set, what they currently need, and how many ppl leave. eg they needed ppl who knew material design and computer vision or graphics or sth for this semester, which is not even close to my skill set. I have experience with user testing, however the ppl who handled user testing were staying on for another semester. so i'm waiting for next sem!

There is also a human-centered robotics lab, i'm not too familiar with that, but I think it's still a lot of \~human-centered design\~ and i think u can google it. finally, Andy van Dam runs his Graphics lab, and i've heard their current project is maybe tangentially related to web dev and ux.

Brown CS vs. USC with Presidential Scholarship,aulisaulisaulis,"One thing I'd advise you to think about is whether location is something you view as important. It seems like the opportunities might not be too different, but Providence is no LA. If not, here are some of my comments about Brown CS (as an APMA-CS concentrator).

* Professors are hit or miss, but this is probably true anywhere.
* The CS TA program at Brown is pretty unique ‚Äì but it is to the extent that some courses are designed to require going to hours in order to complete assignments on time / without struggling.
* There seems to be a dearth of CS classes I'm interested in. I've only taken like 6, and I'm already struggling to find more to take senior year. I'm pretty picky and focused my APMA-CS studies on machine learning and data science though.
* The Open Curriculum is like a godsend. I'm double concentrating in Chemistry, and though it's challenging at times balancing scheduling and whatnot, I still have time to take one or two electives in random departments every once in a while. In addition, in a lot of upper-level humanities courses/seminars, I see a lot of STEM concentrators, so I think there's more of a culture about taking a wide breadth of courses.
* I don't think there's ever any competition for classes or research positions. I got involved with my lab just through a single cold email, and I've never been unable to take a class due to enrollment (aside from humanities seminars though ‚Äì those are tough to get into sometimes).",4,,False,ekaszau,False,False,1554619095.0,2019-04-07 01:38:15
When is course selection for freshmen?,mint-ish,"You can browse available classes on cab.brown.edu but have to wait until the semester to actually register for them. If the course was offered in the past, you can even search in past years/semesters to find its syllabus! The Critical Review is also a great resource to learn about classes (link on each course page in CAB).

RISD classes start on 9/4 I believe, one day after Brown‚Äôs. You can find their academic calendar and their course catalog through Google. After you find some courses you wanna take (definitely have multiple for backups), email the professors well in advance (over summer) and follow up two or three times if they don‚Äôt get back to you in a week - RISD classes can be very hard to get into and the professors aren‚Äôt always responsive. Regardless if they reply or if they say you‚Äôre on the waitlist, show up to the first class. Often times RISD students will drop (they are shopping as well) so you can scoop up their spot. Brown students can only officially register for RISD classes after the semester starts, aka after RISD students pre-register, so being super proactive ahead of time is key. Once the professor says you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôll need to get a cross-registration form from Brown‚Äôs registrar and print RISD‚Äôs cross-registration form as well, and complete each forms‚Äô instructions! 

I think googling ‚ÄúBrown RISD cross registration‚Äù you‚Äôll find a page on Brown‚Äôs site and a page on RISD‚Äôs site about the process. I‚Äôve also registered for RISD classes before w/o any art bg so feel free to msg w any questions!

I only know what you wrote. From what I read I hear the following:

\- the environment in Cali is more appealing to you (the weather and relationship)

\- the academic environment (coursework, research alignment, peers) at Brown is more appealing to you

&#x200B;

It comes down to which one of those you value more. Not a trivial decision.

&#x200B;

I do think that if you get a PhD from Brown - you will have a lifelong partner in research and an institution that will continue to support you. (I have family with PhDs from Brown, who 30 years later continue to be involved with research collaborations at Brown).

Also, I had to deal with this situation, so I really do apologize if I come across as a bit brusque. 

It sounds like were it not for your relationship, you‚Äôd be willing to compromise on the weather (which wasn‚Äôt a major factor in my decision because I‚Äôm from the Northeast, so, again, can‚Äôt relate). If I‚Äôve learned anything in my life, it‚Äôs to *absolutely not* shortchange yourself when it comes to school, a job, or another opportunity for enrichment because of a relationship. This isn‚Äôt to say you don‚Äôt factor the relationship into the decision making process, but if you feel that you‚Äôd be robbing yourself of something better because of the relationship, then you sacrifice the relationship. And that is coming from a person who dumped someone because they were not actually supportive of my future ambitions, so I walk my talk. 

If you feel that Brown is the place for you to be for your career (and it really is an awesome place to be) and study, then come here and do so without regret and focus on you. And you should also already be speaking to your girlfriend regarding this decision. She should know where your head is at and if she‚Äôs pissed at you for making this decision, know that she‚Äôs probably being hypocritical because it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs the one moving. To her, this decision would probably be a no brainer: you got in to Davis and she‚Äôs at school in Davis. Yay, simple choice. But that‚Äôs not actually the case.

Brown's Vibe,Mimobrok,"For me;(Background: attended a top private boarding school in New England, substance-free)

Managable Semester: Rarely will you see anyone in a hurry. People will complain about workload but most of the times it's just for the sake of complaining. At Brown people design their own semester(pick their courses), which includes how early they wakeup or be done for the day, so most people are happy about their semester. 

Undergrad-focused: Yeah, you can get to know your professor really easy here. Some professors are harder to reach than others, but it's very possible to approach most of them and ask stuff (Some professors even stay an hour after class just to answer questions). In some departments, undergrad researches are not that hard to get into if you establish contact with the professor early on. Almost half of my friends are doing/have done research just after the second semester here at Brown.

Brown bubble: I'm still surprised to this moment that people at Brown are too friendly to be real. You just walk toward them, introduce yourself and shake their hand, then 5 minutes later you are talking about how much you hate the Ratty or which class you're taking this semester(Context is still a big thing though. This mostly happens at a sport club/in a class). I went to a very liberal boarding school, but here I think race hardly matters. (You can still get your daily dose of depressing stuff at a Facebook page called Brown Bear Confession, which is basically a place for people to vent very controversial comments anonymously). 

Correctness?: I'm not a conservative, but not very liberal either. Personally I don't like how in many situations, people here seems to introduce themselves with preferred pronouns(especially in very liberal meetings).""Hi, my name is xyz, my preferred pronoun is aa/bb/cc"" I'm perfectly fine with people having a preferred pronoun and stating them, but I wish I had the option of not stating it and just let people assume. Not only should we have the option to state our preferred pronouns, but we should also have the option to choose whether or not we want to state this personal information. I also feel that race matters a lot less when compared to when I was in Boarding school. 

Party Scene: People smoke weed. People get drunk all the time. The good thing is, it doesn't really affect your life if you are sub-free. Not everyone at Brown is here to party, and you won't ever feel coerced to party if you choose not to. People here respect your decision a lot, with or without supporting logic behind it. Even drunk people here will say sorry and lower their voice if you tell them they're being too loud at 11 pm on a weekend night. That's something new for me. Maybe people in my dorm are nicer than average, maybe not. But this is very different from my experience in boarding school. ",12,,1517316884.0,dtgmgpl,False,False,1517316673.0,2018-01-30 06:51:13

Can someone give me the REAL DEAL on the GHB case thing?,brownstudent1,"So we have two female identified individuals: Mary Smith and Jane Doe

Member of Phi Psi: John Doe

Brown student not affiliated with Phi Psi in anyway: Bob Adams

Mary Smith and Jane Doe have stated that they began the night drinking in one of their rooms and according to them had the equivalent of 3-4 drinks. After that they left to a party at another location (they took another drink in a white paper coffee cup). They left the first party after 20-30 mins. After leaving this party they made their way to a party at Phi Psi. 

There Jane spoke with John and received a drink from him. She informed him that she was allergic to several different things (pineapple, almonds etc) so John made her a drink (grain alcohol and cranberry juice) that was not from the cooler because that drink had pineapple in it. Both Jane and Mary have claimed that this was the only drink they had at Phi Psi. 

Jane took a sip from it, gave it to Mary who also took a sip, Jane then put it down for a bit and then finished the rest of it. Both claim that within 10-15 minutes after the consumption of this drink they began to feel really hazy and as if everyone was looking at them as if they were too drunk. 

Mary Smith vaguely remembers returning to her dorm room and struggling to open her door and being sexually assaulted by Bob Adams.

The next morning Mary Smith had a urine test conducted which came back positive for GHB and which was what the University originally communicated to all of the Brown campus. 

Jane Doe had a hair test conducted on her (the sample was obtained a month after the incident) it is important to note that the officer who filled out this form did not do so properly. It was not specified on the form whether Brown wanted the hair sample tested in its entirety or just the segment which would correspond to the alleged incident date. They didn't circle one of the two options. (This is important later on)

The hair test (conducted on Jane Doe) eventually came back negative. This would seem to imply that if Mary Smith was indeed drugged it could have not occurred from the drink that she shared with Jane at Phi Psi. Originally the university was under the belief that this test had merely looked at the entire strand of her hair and could not determine whether or not she was exposed to GHB on the incident date in question. However, after further communication the lab remained adamant that they would have detected a spike in GHB levels and that it was negative.

Another thing thats important to note is that GHB occurs naturally in everyone. A test has to make sure to distinguish between endogenous (natural) and exogenous (external) GHB. 

John Doe, adamantly denying that he had drugged the girls, had an expert look at the urine test and this expert stated that the level that the lab had used wasn't high enough and would not have distinguished between endogenous and exogenous GHB. Essentially he stated that the urine test was inconclusive and could not be used as evidence to say that Mary Smith had been drugged. 

At this point Brown retained its own expert to conduct an independent investigation into both the hair and the urine test. What this expert concluded was that with regards to the urine test the timing of it and the methodology used would not have detected exogenous GHB. In fact, the lab has stopped offering this particular tests due to methodology concerns. 

With regards to the hair test he said that it appeared comprehensive with respect to drugs tested but that there was no indication that it had been segmented prior to being analyzed. According to him this is essential to distinguish between exogenous and endogenous GHB. Furthermore he stated that in his experience it is extremely rare to find GHB in drug facilitated sexual assault cases. 

With this last point it is uncertain what documents Brown provided the expert as the lab that conducted the hair test has adamantly claimed that they did segment the strand of hair (even though Brown did not specify what they wanted) and that their results were conclusive. Whatever the truth may be regarding this test Brown at this point has deemed this test inconclusive as well. 

The fact that his dad is on the board probably has very little to do with the decision. The only thing that has helped him is the fact that he has the money to pay for lawyers in order to get a just and fair due process. If the individual accused had been someone without the means to hire a lawyer and toxicology expert the urine test would surely have been enough to get him expelled. 

This is purely conjecture but I believe that Brown's own lawyers probably recommended against having a hearing due to the lack of physical evidence. If John had been found guilty on a ""preponderance of evidence"" (the girls testimony that they thought they were drugged) John surely would have filed a lawsuit against Brown which in a real court of law (not Brown's kangaroo court) they would have lost. 

At the end of the day it is very difficult to know what may have happened that night. The only thing we can get from all of this is that Brown should have never handled this case. They weren't and still aren't prepared to handle something of this magnitude. Its really sad that something that should easily be proved or disproved (a drugging) through scientific means wasn't due to a bunch of sloppy mistakes.

I guess another question I'd wonder about is, is there a reason they didn't test for Rohypnol also? That's the other famous date rape drug I've heard of.

What does John say about this, other than that he didn't drug them? Does he say he made them a drink at least? Or does he claim they maybe had more drinks or something? Also, are there no witnesses who say something, at least?

And where is Bob in all this?

I agree with you on your last point -- I've never truly understood why Brown tries to handle these things (mostly the rape cases I've heard of while here) internally, because it seems like almost every one I've heard of, they bungle it and people end up furious at them.  It seems like it would be a lot simpler and safer for Brown if they just told people to immediately pursue it with the police.

Can someone give me the REAL DEAL on the GHB case thing?,brownstudent1,"I don't think they test for a specific drug. I think the tests they run in these situations test for a wide range of common date rape drugs. I'm not sure what drugs the urine test covered but I'm sure it would cover most of the common ones. I know that the hair test was tested for 37 date rape drugs which I'm assuming would include the one you mentioned but I'm not 100% certain. 

Per the testimony I have seen John has admitted to interacting with the girls at the party and serving them that single drink. 

There is no witness testimony regarding the drink itself. The witness testimony has just been from people who saw them at the first party and state that they were buzzed but still in control of themselves, an individual or two who saw them leaving the Phi Psi party who stated they were very intoxicated/incapacitated, and the housemate of Jane Doe (an EMT) who interacted with her when she returned to their house and who claims that he did not believe she was drunk but incapacitated by something else. (Its important to emphasize that although an EMT he is by no means a medical expert.) 

Another thing to remember is that other than the housemate (who I'm assuming wasn't drinking) all the people at the party were to some extent inebriated. Once you take out the drug tests which Brown has deemed inconclusive all you have left is a bunch of testimonies from inebriated college students who were probably not paying that close attention to what was happening inside a dimly lit room.

How does that even make sense? Whether he knew she was drugged or not, he would have needed her consent for it not to have been assault.

I remember when I went to college, during our orientation they told us that to officially consent to sex, you essentially needed to say the words ""do you consent to intercourse"" or something and they needed to respond ""yes, I do"", which has obviously never happened in history.

So when you combine that with the fact that college kids frequently hook up while utterly smashed and often don't remember doing it at all, it's gotta be hard for them to make a decision.

You can definitely come up with scenarios where someone does something very confidently (at the time of being drugged), but definitely wouldn't have done it sober.

>If not, then isn't ANY sexual contact with an intoxicated person assault?

I'm pretty sure I remember them telling us this too, in orientation in college, which of course seems pretty silly. Probably only a tiny percentage of hookups are with both people totally sober. But I think that's why this is such a tricky problem to solve, because a lot of the time both the participants really are smashed.

Which absolutely isn't to let rapists off the hook, or to say that in some scenarios it should be pretty damn clear that someone isn't consenting, or able to. But it's still why this is a hard problem for administrators to solve; they don't know whether the guy knew and was assaulting her, or was also very drunk and thought she was too, and she did something she wouldn't have sober because of being drugged.

Can someone give me the REAL DEAL on the GHB case thing?,Jag28,"Right, but being drugged doesn't make you say ""yes I want to have sex"" or whatever other explicit phrase constitutes consent. Regardless of the level of intoxication, if the person can give explicit consent, I don't see how that consent could be deemed illegitimate, unless you make the argument that no one can consent at any level of intoxication.

And yes, I realize that could be read as a rape apologist statement, but that's not at all my intent. I'm simply saying that I don't understand how anyone could assault someone who gave them explicit consent to engage in sexual activities. Whether the guy knew she was drugged or not doesn't really matter if she did in fact give consent by saying something like ""i want to have sex with you right now.""

If she never gave explicit consent, then it's quite obviously sexual assault and/or rape.

""she did something she wouldn't have sober because of being drugged.""

According to our society, that's not a legitimate argument - people who are drunk/on drugs/otherwise intoxicated can be and are held responsible for their actions. If someone's high on PCP and kills a bunch of people, they can't use the argument that ""it's not something I would have done sober."" So I would assume that if someone says ""I want to have sex with you"" when they're drunk, they can't make the argument that they were assaulted because they weren't sober.

Otherwise, wouldn't you have to make the victim-blaming argument ""drinking puts you at risk of rape""?",1,,False,cp8rpbm,False,False,1425870110.0,2015-03-08 22:01:50
Can someone give me the REAL DEAL on the GHB case thing?,ohgodballseverywhere,">Right, but being drugged doesn't make you say ""yes I want to have sex"" or whatever other explicit phrase constitutes consent.

Why not? I know they're somewhat extreme examples, but look up Erowid experience reports on PCP or Datura, if you don't already know them. Some drugs make people do crazy stuff, like say/do things they definitely wouldn't sober, and have no control over their actions. I'm not saying that GHB is the same as those drugs, but my point still stands.

If the guy knew she was unintentionally drugged, I think most people would say ""I don't care what she says right now, even if she's adamant she wants to, just don't sleep with her"". That seems pretty straightforward, I think. There's of course the possibility that she says it then and really wouldn't mind it after the fact, but I think most people would err on the side of not doing it, for this exact type of scenario.

This is speculation, but I'd guess that, from a societal standpoint, being responsible for your non-sober actions goes out the window when the drugs were given to you without your knowledge/against your will.

I obviously agree with you that if she didn't consent, it's 100% assault either way.

I assume we also agree that if he legitimately didn't know she was drugged, and she somehow consented in her drug addled state (and also definitely would never have if she were sober), then it's a terrible situation but Bob can't be blamed any more than any guy taking part in a trashed hookup (though of course, many people would also argue that in that situation too, the guy really shouldn't go forward unless he's sure she would make the same decision sober, but that's a whole other direction).

We seem (based on your OP, ""or she did give consent, in which case whether or not she was drugged is irrelevant, even if 'Bob' knew"") to disagree on the situation where Bob knows she has been drugged without her knowledge, but while drugged she is adamant/consenting that she wants to sleep with him. Unless I'm misunderstanding you, you seem to be saying that no matter her state, if she says she's willing to have sex, then it's okay, *even if he knows she has been drugged,* is that right?

Disregard this if that isn't what you meant, but I'd personally definitely err on the side that it's wrong. It would just seem really wrong to me to sleep with someone I knew had gotten roofied, no matter what she was saying at the moment.",2,,False,cp8w1wu,True,False,1425880703.0,2015-03-09 00:58:23

Correct. The opposite argument would be ""it's wrong to have sex with a willing participant if you know that they aren't 100% sober,"" which I think is way too extreme, especially in a society with multibillion dollar industries whose entire purpose to encourage people not to be 100% sober.",-1,,False,cp92ip3,False,False,1425906570.0,2015-03-09 08:09:30
Can someone give me the REAL DEAL on the GHB case thing?,ohgodballseverywhere,"Hmm, well I don't think that's exactly the opposite argument. There are several important differences -- foremost, in this case, that she didn't choose to be drugged.

""If you know they aren't 100% sober"" is also too extreme, I'd say. I'd say that if you and your partner who have been together for years and had sex countless times get really drunk, it's a safe bet that they won't regret having sex with you.

My point is it doesn't have to be either extreme, there's a lot of middle ground, and of course it's harder to decide what's right there.

Since you brought it up before, taking into account what general society thinks, do you think most of society would think it's okay for a guy to sleep with a girl he knows has been drugged without her knowledge? Obviously you might disagree with society, but I suspect if you took a poll most people would say that it's pretty not-okay. I also think most people would say that it's okay if a husband sleeps with his tipsy wife of 5 years, right?

Can someone give me the REAL DEAL on the GHB case thing?,Jag28,"Possibly, but isn't consent required every time for every act? So just because you've been married/having sex with someone for 5+ years doesn't justify having sex with them while their drunk (if you don't believe intoxicated consent is real consent).

And where do you draw the line in terms of intoxication? What if someone is given what they think is a low ABV drink at a party, but it turns out to be significantly stronger than they expected or wanted? Is it wrong to then have sex with them if they explicitly want it, because they've been drugged without their knowledge?

To me, it seems like the issue has become more complicated than it ever needed to be. It should boil down to ""yes means yes"" and anything other than that is assault. Level of intoxication shouldn't matter if the intoxicated person is conscious/aware enough to give explicit consent, given how many people purposefully get intoxicated while trying to find sexual partners.",1,,False,cp985by,False,False,1425918036.0,2015-03-09 11:20:36
Can someone give me the REAL DEAL on the GHB case thing?,ohgodballseverywhere,"I'm not saying that I can tell you exactly where the line is, or where I think it should be, but that doesn't mean I don't think there should be one. All I'm saying is that, in my opinion (though again, I'd guess this is the more common opinion), sleeping with your consenting, tipsy, longtime spouse isn't wrong, but sleeping with a consenting, unwillingly drugged person you barely know is wrong. It's definitely more complicated in the middle ground and I'm not claiming I know how to solve that problem, but I don't think that changes those two situations.

You argument seems to be the more general argument that if something is a continuum, you can't say any two points on it are in distinctly different categories. That might be an interesting debate or something, but more practically, a ton (most?) of our laws are based on having to draw a line somewhere, even if it's tricky.

The reason I think it has to be more complicated is that ""yes means yes"" is an oversimplification. It's more like ""yes might mean yes but also might be a horrible mistake"". I'm not accusing you at all, but I'm curious why you seem to be defending the position of a guy who would sleep with an unwillingly drugged girl -- it seems like you're into personal responsibility (on the end of the consenting person), which I tend to agree with, but isn't it just kind of a safer bet to just call it off in this one instance?

I'm arguing for personal responsibility for both parties. Sober people shouldn't have sex with people who don't consent, and intoxicated people shouldn't consent if they don't mean it. ""Doing something you wouldn't normally do because you're intoxicated"" doesn't qualify as sexual assault, it qualifies as making a poor decision and regretting it later. Regret =/= assault. A sober person could give explicit consent, but then regret having sex the next day. That doesn't mean he was raped/assaulted, it means he regrets having consensual sex. It's the same thing for intoxicated people. If you're sober enough to consent (and do), then it's not assault. Seems pretty clear cut to me, and that if we're going to draw a line, then the line should be when someone can't give explicit consent, it's assault.",1,,False,cp9qh4f,False,False,1425947649.0,2015-03-09 19:34:09

IAMA frat boy at brown AMA,mongooseondaloose,"Interesting! I've always kinda wanted to talk to somebody in a fraternity here (while not at a rush event or stumbling around randomly at a party), so I guess this AMA is pretty relevant to me. I guess I'll start off by saying most all of my good friends back home are in greek systems- but most are SEC or Big 12, so I know a bit already about greek life in general, but I'm starting to think that this means I know just about nothing about Brown greek life. This is an AMA, so I guess I should start asking questions, right?    
tl;dr- I have a dozen or so frat friends at home, 1 or 2 at brown, I wanna ask some questions.    
1. What made you decide to go greek? Brown's system doesn't seem to have some of the ""appeal"" of most other schools: nice houses, a close-knit (though sometimes obnoxiously exclusive) greek community, more than 2 sororities, networking opportunities (but correct me if I'm wrong- it just seems like Brown does a pretty good job of that for everyone), and the availability of parties (I've never really had any trouble getting in the door).    
2. I rushed, but nobody seemed to really try to convince me- everybody who pledged seemed to know somebody already in the house, whether through sports or other things. Is that how a lot of it is?    
3. What's your/ general frat scene's view of independents? It doesn't seem like there's a huge anti-GDI sentiment in Brown's greek community, and I don't know if y'all could really afford to block out that much of the population to be honest.   
4. Despite what I've heard back home, I haven't heard one mention of  ""Hell Week"" up here, and my friends seemed to think favorably about initiation- things that would shock my friends back home. So. How was pledgeship?

If you read online, they're going to open libraries and dining halls and in a few days I'll get to see off campus friends. That new dashboard page describing the levels is super helpful!! There is a lot of in person stuff I will get to do for the next three months even though my large lectures will be online, so I am happy with being here. I am alsoooo really happy to see my friends (we're all going to be on campus soon!!) and do some in person tutoring and group studies. I got here two weeks ago and will stay until after finals so I'll have the whole 3.5 month long semester thing going, which makes me feel ""settled"" in an unsettling time. I have been trying to make the most of my home situation, avoiding covid, creating friendships, and studying but I think I've got it down during this quiet period. I do think that \*no one\* will miss out on much, if anything at all, by being remote this semester. You might save some solid money that way :))). It's just a question of whether or not you think it's a good idea compared to your situation at home/away. IMO, if you abide by the rules you can be social here and enough students are already here that you will not be alone after quiet period stage 1 (the 4-5 days where you cant leave your residence hall while everyone gets their 1st and 2nd tests).

Also, I doubt that Brown will send students home even if there's a significant spike in cases, some of the pamphlets I've read seem to imply that they'll just have people essentially in a Quiet Period phase if cases get too high. A lot of the resources (like CAPS and the libraries) won't be available in-person, and most classes are gonna be remote anyway.

Experience with Watson Institute as an Undergrad?,AggravatingSubstance,"I am probably going to concentrate in a Watson concentration, not sure if I will do the old one or the new combined one. Reasons for the phase out of the 3 concentrations (according to administrators) were to make the concentrations more flexible, encourage more faculty buy-in by housing all of the programs under one ""roof,"" making the requirements less restrictive (IR could make you do 20 courses), and a bunch of other things. Whether I buy the reasons is a different story. Honestly, when it comes to content there aren't any significant differences between the IAPA tracks and the old concentrations, many of the changes are cosmetic imo.   


Watson has a fuckton of resources. The quite literally throw money at IAPA concentrators, they offer 10k USD language study grants, internships, research grants, its crazy how well-funded the Watson is. I agree, its curriculum is Eurocentric and colonial (esp. poli sci) and I also agree it gives off white neoliberal vibes. However, I set my mind to find classes to counter this narrative and they do exist,  and you can take courses from other departments that count towards a Watson concentration.

Experience with Watson Institute as an Undergrad?,brown3181,"Like the other poster commented, I'd say Watson as a whole can sort of have a neoliberal vibe. There has been a lot of [healthy critique](https://www.browndailyherald.com/2019/10/25/teach-critiques-colonialism-watson/) the past couple years of Watson's curriculum for being too Eurocentric and colonialist. That said, I wasn't an IR concentrator but I studied something related and all the Watson-affiliated faculty that I had classes with were amazing and the students in them weren't like that at all. YMMV. 

The Watson facilities are also some of the nicest/newest buildings on campus, and they host lectures and events (with good food) multiple times weekly during the academic year (although who knows when this will return post Corona).

As far as why a bunch of concentrations are getting merged into one, I think a lot of it is just for administrative reasons (like to streamline the advising process, simplify requirements, appeal to a broader range of students, etc) .

Prospective student,Rnet1234,"I'll second this. There used to be an accredited program, but I believe the class of 2017 was the last class that was able to do it.

Accreditation is definitely important. What I'm not so familiar with is how important a Civil specific degree is for working in that industry. There's certainly significant overlap with MechE in terms of solid mechanics and the like, but there *are* some differences such as soil science. At the end of the day though, practicing as a CE will require getting a PE license, which I suspect would cover all of the gaps. An engineering degree is less about teaching you absolutely everything you need to know and more about exposure and teaching high level concepts so that once you start working you can adapt and learn quickly. 

I would also agree that mechE has a few more options than civil in terms of work due to being a little less specialized out of the gate - I could see someone hiring a mechE for a civil job, but I couldn't see someone hiring a civil engineer for aerospace work (my field), for example (or it would be a lot harder at least).",3,,False,fwtjuq2,False,False,1593795512.0,2020-07-03 11:58:32

***prospective student*** I just had some questions for current students/alumni because I want to know if it's a good fit :),conjjord,"1. This is going to sound cliche, but I chose Brown for *the people*. I toured quite a number of schools, applied to 15, and then attended ADOCH last April. Immediately I was struck by just how different everyone here seemed from any other place I had seen. Brown students are collaborative and supportive, but not afraid to correct misgivings or wrongdoings. Everyone here is passionate and, to an unprecedented degree in my experience, willing/excited to share that passion. It's what fuels the Open Curriculum and makes Brown such an intellectual powerhouse. It's lovely and readily apparent.
2. Brown is also a very humbling place, but not in a bad way. It's challenging, but rewarding. The unique aspect is the support in place to show you that, while you're human, you are capable and excellent in your own way. So that lesson definitely has value but is more broad in scope. For me personally, the greatest experience was utilizing the Open Curriculum. I'm a STEM guy but love classical archaeology, so I took two ARCH classes this year (my first). By the end of the first semester, I was hired as an intern on an archaeological dig in Italy. When that fell through due to COVID, my professor hired me on-campus to design a database for the project, integrating my knowledge of CS and archaeology. There's a great value in branching out and finding that interdisciplinary study will carry you far.
3. I wouldn't say ""dichotomous""; there are much more than two interests to be had and you'll find people here who dabble in pretty much all of them. Certainly everyone here is, to some degree, well-rounded and interdisciplinary; there's a ubiquitous search for knowledge and creativity that pervades the student body, and there's definitely a spot for your passions here. I actually wrote my personal statement about reconciling my love for science and love of calligraphy, so the science/art duality definitely works, but be sure to flesh everything out. And, most importantly, whether you end up here or not, what matters about college is what you make of it, not where you go. Everyone who makes it through college admissions realizes the stress wasn't worth it, so try not to worry! You'll end up somewhere fantastic and do great things.

Hope this helps, and best of luck!",15,,False,fqz4j5b,False,False,1589759781.0,2020-05-17 18:56:21

3. I wouldn‚Äôt say dichotomous. well-rounded is the more commonly used term and the idea is that you shouldn‚Äôt be good at literally just one thing (namely academics). basically everyone who has an application which isn‚Äôt immediately shredded by admissions must have been an extremely strong student so if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôve got, that isn‚Äôt very impressive. you have to bring more to the table",4,,False,fr07cns,False,False,1589785985.0,2020-05-18 02:13:05

Questions regarding pre med at brown!,conjjord,"Not a pre-med, but quite adjacent (CompBio).

* Brown is a seriously undergraduate-focused school, so your experience is absolutely prioritized, though you have to take the reigns and make the best of it. I seriously underestimated the Open Curriculum coming in - it really is that great. As a pre-med you'll have requirements to fulfill the same as any other institution, but Brown gives you the extra freedom to really explore your passions.
* Brown students don't declare a concentration until the end of their sophomore year - we have one undergrad College that you apply to!
* Brown is extremely collaborative, and while some classes are curved there is never much competition. Orgo especially fosters a lot of co-studying.
* Research is incredibly easy; I started my prefrosh summer. Internships are frequent, especially because of the high density of hospitals in Providence with little other competition like in Boston. The EMT program is extremely competitive, but I've heard it's very fulfilling.
* [Last year's med matriculation rate was 85%.](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/health-careers/medical-admission-data-snapshot)
* Look at the comments on that advising post.

Questions regarding pre med at brown!,one-palladium,"* Chill for the most part. The pre-med vibe here isn't gunner mentality from what I've seen, which could be because everyone is busy pursuing their own passions! Help is virtually everywhere - talk to upperclassmen for advice on classes/professors and your peers with forming study groups and keeping each other accountable. Personally, I really liked my classes (orgo and physio in the fall), and there are many opportunities to do non-pre-med related things. If we're stressed about a pre-med class, we stress together.
* We have one college, just like the previous poster said.
* See above.
* Yes, but a few of them like BEMS are competitive. Regardless, you don't need to be in BEMS to be a solid pre-med, and research is very accessible. If you want to secure a research opportunity this coming fall, I would reach out to professors in August and explain your goals, interests, background, etc. I secured a research opportunity in my freshman fall in October and have been doing research since. PM me if you'd like to know more about research on campus - it's one of my favorite things here.
* I'm writing the MCAT this summer, and I found that Brown's classes are very helpful, not just for knowledge but for critical reasoning, especially important since the MCAT is a reasoning exam. Med school acceptance rate is [high](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/advising/health-careers/medical-admission-data-snapshot). Though I have not undergone the application process yet, it seems that health careers advising gives a lot of support for applicants in terms of personal statement, interviews, making sure you're on top of coursework/ecs.
* The few interactions I've had with pre-med advising were alright, but I didn't have any real questions at that time. I mostly got help by asking and building relationships with med students/residents who were kind to offer their insights - highly recommend finding mentors in medicine.",2,,1588012197.0,forgbl8,False,False,1588011748.0,2020-04-27 13:22:28
Questions regarding pre med at brown!,acetrainerelise,"I figure I'll add my voice to the mix:

* It's honestly great. Classes are hard, yes, but they're not made harder by people being nasty and competitive with each other. There's a lot of opportunities for extra help in most premed classes, and in general, profs are super responsive to questions and genuinely want to help you learn. There's tons of great opportunities for extracurriculars, both clinical and nonclinical, and  there's not really a feeling of being ""weeded out"" (in fact, I wasn't premed when I started college, and I was told that I *should* look into being a doctor!)

* There's no difference- the only ""special applications"" you could do is to PLME, which is a whole other beast. I think even our school of engineering doesn't require a special application, but I'm not 100% on that because I'm not an engineer.

* TONS of support! I love my friends! I love my profs! My teammates are great, and I actually met one of my best friends at ADOCH- we've stayed good friends since :) My profs have been, on the whole, fantastic. My physics prof, who teaches 150+ students this semester, made the effort to learn the name of every student in the class, and he can still tell you where they usually sit in the room, even after this month of quarantine. My advisor guided me through a quarter-life crisis. I recently emailed my prof from last spring out of the blue, and he offered me a project to work on. Like I said, I love my profs.

* Brown EMS, as the other commenter noted, is competitive (I was waitlisted). However, there's lots of other fantastic options in the PVD area, like volunteering at the Rhode Island Free Clinic, Connect for Health, or working for Alert Ambulance (an interfacility transport company). There are also 3 hospitals in the city, and all of them have volunteering programs iirc. CareerLAB is a good resource for internships, and you're pretty much guaranteed to find research if you email enough professors. You'll also need nonclinical volunteering, which the Swearer Center is fantastic and helping you find. 

* I haven't taken the MCAT yet, but Brown's average is a 515, which is like 95th percentile. We have an 85-92% acceptance rate every year, compared to the national average of 40%. 

* The premed advisors are, in my opinion, bad at giving you specific advice, but good at laying out a roadmap. If you tell them, ""I have two activities that I'm equally interested in, but I don't know which will be better for my app"", they would just say ""Do what you're more interested in!"" (not helpful). They do a good job of making your expectations very clear- which classes to take, which categories of ECs you need, etc. You can ask r/premed the specific questions that come up once you're in college (they don't exactly love high schoolers lmao).

Expensive Italian: Pan e Vino on Federal Hill; Pastiche for dessert
Best Brunch: Julians or Nick's on Broadway

There used to be a restaurant called Kitchen over by The Grange, it was tiny, sat like 7 or 8 people. Owner was the cook and the server, limited menu. Best breakfast I've ever had. It took a hiatus bc the owner was sick, but I think it might've opened up again in the last year. 

On campus: Den Den is really good; Kabob and Curry is great Indian cuisine (I've head Taste of India and Rasoi, both on Hope street north of campus are good too); East Side Pockets for shwarma and gyros; Meeting Street Cafe for amazing baked goods; Amy's place on Wickenden for breakfast; Noodles 102 on Ives for asian fusion; Sawadee on Hope for Thai; Silver Star Bakery on Ives for portuguese sweetbread and pasties; Flames near Rhode Island Hospital is Jamaican food, super strange and spicy, but awesome; Fellini's on Wickenden for pizza by the slice.

If you can make it over to East Providence, it's worth trying Portuguese food if you've never had it. The Shrimp Mozambique at Madeira's is out of this world.

I was lucky enough that my prices were the same for both schools, but either way I understand how difficult this choice can be.

It really comes down to whether or not you view collegiate education as a means to an end or an end in itself. Almost everyone I've met here at Brown falls into the latter category. We're here because we are genuinely curious and design our own curriculum to accommodate that. Obviously we don't have a monopoly on curiosity, and obviously there are still many students here for which college is mainly a stepping stone to a well-paid career. You'll find the same at UofT as well, though the culture won't be as united around that pure love of learning.

A lot of my friends attend very prestigious technical schools throughout the country and their classes simply don't cover everything that we do here. Your GPA will be higher and your learning rigorous.

I'm not going to shamelessly plug my university, nor tell you that you'd be stupid to turn it down. Ivies aren't everything and rankings don't matter - ask literally any college graduate. But there's a reason Brown is as prestiged as it is. Its focus on undergraduate education and culture is so very unique and I will advise that if you think you can afford it/are willing to take on debt, I would go to Brown.

However, you should keep in mind the Brown doesn't have minors (you could still take a great deal of polisci classes with the Open Curriculum, though). Additionally, from what I can tell, applying to medical schools in Canada seems to be very difficult (particularly w/ a ton of the Canadian schools only being open to students from their province). You might be at a disadvantage applying to medical schools in the US from a Canadian school with a (possibly) lower GPA. 

However, U of T would be a much better financial choice. You mentioned you weren't certain about medical school, in which case you might want to minimize future debt. Brown is a fantastic experience but it might not be worth $60k a year, particularly if you have a choice that's worth $20k a year. 

I think a lot of people in this thread are very passionate about Brown and that's fantastic, but the financial aspect of college is important.

Brown vs. University of Toronto?,Slowthugger,"Sorry I just have to push back a bit on this. UofT is considered one of the top schools globally, and its price reflects the heavily subsidized tuition by the Canadian and Ontario governments - and not its quality. Schools do not provide anyone ""a fulfilling life"" - it falls on the students to learn, network, and connect to achieve this.

Toronto is a better city than Providence - period. Networking would be unparalleled but would fall on the student to go out and attend events. Both have strong alumni networks, but Brown definitely has a stronger ""community"" feel. Drinking age is different too - if you care about that stuff anyway.

Medical school is expensive - so taking on US-level debt early on in your educational career is... a huge difference. It would be a different conversation if you were accepted into PLME and were guaranteed admission to a medical school, but let's say you change plans and you end up in 4 years with a ScB or a BSc only - which side of the border do you want to be on? Do you think employers really care between two very good schools?

I did my Undergrad at public school in Ontario - I am now at Brown for grad school, and I am not convinced its prestige is worth the cost differential.

Brown vs. University of Toronto?,Slowthugger,"Sure - I mean it's a fair point... but you could likely argue that you should then go to Brock for your undergrad and then apply to medical school after, right? 

There are people who have gone from UofT Bio directly into med school. There are people who have done a Brown undergrad and gone into med school. There are people who have gone to both institutions and have unfortunately not gotten in. 

It seems like you have two really solid options - which is really exciting. There are people all over the world who have studied at both institutions and who have gone on to do great things, including medicine. I think it comes down to how hard you work to achieve good grades, wherever you go.

I would caution against a ""Ivy or bust"" mentality - because I promise you UofT can hold its weight from an employer, research, and alumni perspective. It also depends where you want to work after school, if your funds are currently in USD or CAD (because.. the exchange rate can really hurt sometimes) and if you're able/willing to be paying off debt for however much longer it will take you to do so. It's easy to picture a world where Brown and UofT cost the same - but that's not the reality we live in and if the cost is a big factor for you, then you should treat it as such.

In Math 100 an entire month is solely dedicated to series. All the exams for Math 100 were written very well too.

Classes You Regret Taking,speedx77,"As far as intro math courses go, Math 90 is Calc 1/ AB stuff. Math 100 is Calc 2/BC stuff. You can take Math 90 in the fall and then Math 100 in the spring, but if you have already taken BC in HS and did well I think you'll do just fine in Math 100 (skipping over Math 90).

It all comes down to requirements for whatever concentration you are looking at. Some concentrations will require that you take higher level math courses from the jump. The requirements for any degree can be found online. 

https://bulletin.brown.edu/the-college/concentrations/

Your best course of action will be to talk to your academic advisor and student advisor (Mieklejohn) when you meet them in the fall. They'll be way more help than I am. 

Use this site to see what courses are available in the fall/spring of 19/20 school year: https://cab.brown.edu

Edit: math 100 was taught in this order:

Integration Techniques-Series-Parametric/Polar Curves-Differential Eqns

Also, if you are planning to take the more rigorious/theoretical ODE/PDE classes aka APMA 350/360 for APMA or math concentrators (as opposed to 330/340 which is for engineers and physicists), then you will need to take Math 200 and linear alg first anyways since they are pretty essential pre reqs",2,,False,eq455o4,False,False,1559769440.0,2019-06-05 16:17:20

Brown vs Johns Hopkins??,aulisaulisaulis,"Speaking as a current applicant, being a premed at Brown is a lot more chill than at other schools, and there‚Äôs less of an overt sense of competition for grades. The ABC grading system is also a lot more forgiving than with pluses and minuses, and you‚Äôll get a lot more opportunities to explore other fields as well.

Some tangibles
- Brown classes, for the most part (except Orgo 1/2) are designed such that 50% of the class gets an A
- Biology labs at Brown are super chill and easy. I‚Äôve heard that JHU labs are super tough, and that your data actually matters.
- Chemistry at Brown is annoying if you don‚Äôt start with CHEM 330 in Fall semester, since Orgo 1 is only offered in the Spring.
- You can drop classes at any point before reading period and have them disappear from your record forever. Fails are treated the same way, and despite AMCAS technically requiring them to count, Brown advising officially disregards that policy. 
- Advising here kind of sucks, but if you have good friends who can work together and some upperclassmen in the know, you‚Äôll have no problem.

Any Music Concentrators?,suikunkun,"I'm a senior, conductor, and music concentrator. I run the chamber orchestra, am the assistant to the university orchestra, and am currently running the orchestra [Into the Woods,](https://www.facebook.com/events/888588281485571) which, in fact, happens during the first day of next week's ADOCH! besides that, I take classes, play the cello, and do stuff with the music DUG (department undergraduate group) and Fermata, the student composers' club.

the music concentration is pretty wild - it's very free, and the tracks in the major were recently eliminated so now there's just one very general music major. one important thing to know is that it's not performance-based. the 3 areas used to be electronic music & multimedia, ethnomusicology, and ""history, theory, and composition"". I'm in that last category, which I imagine started out as essentially ""classical"", and eventually became ""not electronic or ethno"" - which means it includes jazz, pop, and other things like that outside the context of electronic music. classes have a pretty good selection between theory (both classical & pop/jazz), history/scholarship (classical, modern, ethno, electronic, ...), and composition of all styles (including classes on DAWs and recording studios). as for ensembles, there are many - on the department-run side, the orchestra, chorus, jazz band, wind symphony, world music ensemble, folk string band - and on the student-run side, the chamber orchestra (ayyy), a student choir, lots of bands, lots of acapellas, and student theatre groups. 

I'm a fan of individual professors in the department, but it's not perfect. there's been a lot of retirements and sabbaticals going on, which contributes to general instability. the curriculum is kind of nebulous, and I've met people who think it's been too strict and people who think it's been too lenient. I have some concerns about diversity and inclusion in the department. the building is not accessible at all (no elevators, classes often on the 3rd floor). still, we're getting a new chair next year, who I hope can do a good job, and I do like many parts of it!

as a music student, and really as a Brown student, my experience is that there's a lot of freedom. a lot of the experience is what you make of it. especially as a conductor, in my case - there is barely any structure whatsoever for what I'm doing, so I create a lot of my own opportunities through lots of organizational & communicative work. but people here are pretty enthusiastic about playing, and doing cool stuff, so hooray!

......................................................

**Brown created a center for what was once called neural science in the  early 1970s. As early as 1999, it created a  brain science program as a  forum for different disciplines to collaborate, growing into the  institute by 2009.

What is the worst class you have taken at Brown?,mongooseondaloose,"This semester, I took a class titled SOC1090: Theories of Organizational Dynamics and Decision Making. It started off pretty interesting: got a bit into the psychology of group behavior and choice, but then became an entirely different beast. Apparently, the class is a concentration requirement for Commerce, Organizations, and Entrepreneurship- something that was not well-advertised, but I figured, hey, how could this go wrong?

Famous last words. After about 3 to 4 weeks of interesting group theory, the course apparently renamed itself ""How to Own a Business 101: Being a CEO"". Readings, lectures, and section topics completely shifted focus to employees, profits, ROI, and competition. Don't get me wrong, it was sort of interesting stuff- just not at all what I signed up for. Don't worry, it gets worse.

The only means of evaluation in the class were 3 papers and 3 quizzes (and attendance, but meh). The papers were horribly structured group projects with abhorrently broad topics and short (7 page) length constraints, ambiguously graded with little meaningful feedback, and lent themselves far too easily to free-riders. The quizzes were 6-question multiple-choice monstrosities with the ""Pick the *best* answer"" philosophy. Questions were so unclear and answers were so similar such that I nearly considered bringing a coin to flip for the last quiz.

Have you seen a cryptid on Brown's campus? Please submit your story here.,mattblau,"Hello! A surprising number of users are discussing the sighting of a cryptid on campus. **There's nothing to be alarmed about**, it might just be some weird hoax or ARG. I just don't want to spread misinformation, or allow legitimate first-hand accounts to influence each other so early on.

This is just a temporary thing, hopefully we can get to the bottom of this soon. Please reach out if you have any details about these events.

>***tl;dr:*** Quite a few people on Brown's Reddit page have been posting about cryptid sightings. I don't want these firsthand accounts to influence each other, and I also don't want to spread misinformation/mass hysteria on the platform. So here's a (temporary!) Google form.  
  
>  
>***SHOULD I BE WORRIED?***  
No. Sightings seem to be benign as far as I know.   
  
>  
>***WHAT'S THE SITUATION?***  
In the past 24 hours, a handful of users on [reddit.com/r/BrownU](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://reddit.com/r/BrownU&sa=D&ust=1601058099916000&usg=AFQjCNGBX6lFjaHvyE6vmELM012L1uVAgg) have been posting about weird sightings on campus, claiming to have witnessed supernatural events. To make sure that independent first-hand accounts aren't influencing each other, I decided to make this intake form. I don't want descriptions to influence each other -- the more first-hand, independent accounts to corroborate, the better.   
  
>  
>***WHO OWNS THIS GOOGLE FORM?***  
Hello there! I'm a senior currently studying at Brown. I'm a skeptical person who is very interested in supernatural sightings. I'm happy to give out my name and email and all that, just send a response to this form and I'll get in touch with you ASAP.   
  
>  
>***WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THESE RESPONSES?***  
In a few days, I'll make a post on /r/BrownU with a general summary of the responses I've collected -- respecting everyone's privacy, of course. Depending on how severe things are, I'll reach out to individuals to figure out what's going on.   
  
>  
>***WHY BOTHER?***  
People who moderate online communities have a big responsibility to tell the truth on their platforms, and I want to take this situation seriously. Please message me if you have ideas or suggestions on how to better handle this situation. I don't really know what I'm doing, either.

Experience with professor Egan's online classes??,1318253,"I love Professor Egan's online classes! There are no lectures within the classes at all. I highly recommend his classes - he turns them into a fun illustrated full immersive game. It's way more engaging than Zoom class and far less tiring. This is also especially good for time zone differences or fitting this class into your schedule! There are assignments every week, some of which include watching movies or playing video games, and all you have to do is make sure you submit them by the deadline! It was a really good fifth class for me. Similarly, Professor Egan is super responsive and gave me lots of extensions when I started struggling at the beginning of quarantine.

The grading is holistic, so you aren‚Äôt given exact metrics for how you are doing in the class. I was somewhat irrationally worried that if I did alright but had consistent issues in one area without improving I would fail.

I think overall I put more effort into the work of CS19 than was needed to pass, but I felt good about the work I produced and the effort I put in. The holistic grading makes it impossible for me to know how much less I could have done to pass.

Swim Team?,StudentLoanSlave1,"Gotcha. So I was recruited back in 2013 and swam on the team. They‚Äôre like family to me. The thing is, since we got the new pool, the recruiting has become way more competitive. We had walk ons when I swam but they got cut due to title IX. Seeing as the team has become more competitive, I‚Äôd say you would need at least one junior national cut to be considered. And that‚Äôs IF (big if) they have a roster spot available. 

I will give you this warning. Being a walk on does not mean you are held to a lower standard than the rest of the team. You will he expected to show up at every practice (6:00 am morning three days a week, every afternoon at 3:00). You can‚Äôt study abroad because the season spans both semesters as well. You have to cut your winter holiday short to go on training trip (2 very hard practices per day for 2 straight weeks). So it‚Äôs a commitment to be sure and not something you should do unless you‚Äôre willing to endure the rigorous schedule. Especially because the swim team has always prided themselves on being one of the most academic focused teams in the nation (or at least we were when I swam). 

But I don‚Äôt want to discourage you. The swim team is a tight knit family and I am still very close with people from both men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams. It‚Äôs an invaluable community that I wouldn‚Äôt trade for the world. So there‚Äôs give and take in terms of what you‚Äôll get from it. If you still feel like you want to walk on, there‚Äôs no harm in reaching out and asking the coaching staff, no matter what your times are.

Has anyone done summer research on campus without UTRA?,FVBLT,"I've done it, and without any funding. I had to get a part time job at one of the campus libraries so overall I was working in lab 20 hours a week, which my advisor was fine with since he wasn't paying me. If you don't have a big separate source of money you basically need to find a part time job to survive, so I would make sure your advisor is chill with the idea of you basically working half time. I would also start trying to find a job as soon as possible if you go this route since it can take months to land even a part-time gig (and make sure you can actually get from your job to your lab and back in timely fashion).

I also got UTRA funding the next summer so I have a pretty direct comparison between the two situations. The biggest difference was having to juggle the separate schedules for the library job and lab. I would also (UTRA or not) definitely recommend getting your summer housing situation in order as early as humanly possible, it's been a while but I remember there being a lot of houses on Governor St and the surrounding area that groups of students would rent during the Summer for much cheaper than trying to find something for you alone.

Has anyone done summer research on campus without UTRA?,speedforcing,"I did non-UTRA undergrad research last summer! Full time, 40+ hours a week in a CS lab. My stipend was funded (I think) through a combination of the CS Department and outside stakeholders (tech companies). Above minimum wage for sure, but by no means cushy. 

&#x200B;

Some things to keep in mind:

&#x200B;

Location/Environment: I had a lease in Providence for the summer already, because I am living off-campus this year. This means it was a super smooth transition in terms of housing and I didn't have to worry about subletting a place. Honestly though, there's an abundance of students trying to get others to sublet their apartments/houses for pretty cheap prices. I would start searching for housing on the sooner side, just to get it out of the way. Providence in the summer is a total blast (sans the Summer@Brown kids who are obnoxious) -- my friends and I went to lots of local events like craft fairs, the Pride parade, etc. and were even able to take day-trips to different cities and go camping on the weekends. 

&#x200B;

Lab Culture/Project: For me, my lab was a blast because there were 8 undergrad researchers (including me) who were all either rising sophomores or juniors. The professor also really encouraged a social and collaborative lab environment, which I think helped a lot (and on our own we organized game nights, parties, etc.), and he even took us on a day trip at one point. Coding for 8 hours straight without talking to anyone is not my idea of fun at all, and having a lab culture that reflected our more product-centric team really made my experience. Think about what you types of projects and work environments you value and try to do research that closely matches up with them. 

&#x200B;

Hours/Flexibility: This lab was flexible in terms of hours, but that made for a sometimes stressful and unpredictable environment. Ex: in weeks leading up to demos for our sponsors or other stakeholders, I would work 60+ hours a week (and sometimes even pull a few 5 or 6 AM end times) instead of 40, but would then have a super light load the next week and could take 2 days off. The work load fluctuated and was definitely super extreme at some points, but this is not the case for every single lab.

&#x200B;

Hope this was helpful! Let me know if you have anymore questions (or feel free to message me).

It gave me some focus (i.e. I needed to finish my degree, bar anything else), but it didn't push me down a particular career path or anything. I was still exploring and taking all sorts of cool classes even as a Spring term senior. The social scene at Brown wasn't great for me, personally, so I got more and more turned off of the political scene on campus (the infamous Ray Kelly incident, where activist students deplatformed an invited guest speaker, happened my freshman year), and that definitely solidified in my last two years (where there were student activist events focused on sexual assault on campus, divestment from coal, unionization of grad students, Columbus Day, Brown's off-campus property on Native American land in southern RI, police brutality, the 2016 election, etc.). I was willing to tolerate and hear out the arguments of the loudest student activists, but as I got closer to graduating, I figured it wasn't worth trying to have an intelligent discussion with them really (one of them was an anti-vaxxer, so that kinda ruined it for me as well). In that way, I think Brown might have made me more of a jerk, but it also made me grow up and think critically about people and their motives outside the classroom as well as in it. The one academic/career- minded thing Brown helped me with is in regards to how I think about science and history. I've always been passionate about advocating for science and the scientific method, against things like creationism and the anti-vaccination movement. Having so many critical-thought/constructivist- leaning peers and professors really taught me to see where the weaknesses of science lie and how to patch them up in social consciousness.

Why should I choose Brown engineering over UPenn?,Joseph949,"Brown will be a lot more pleasant for your four years here. I have friends at Penn, and that place is an academic pressure cooker. Engineering/CS is going to be a stressful major anywhere, and Brown has way less academic pressure than Penn. I‚Äôve taken a bunch of CS classes at Brown and I would definitely say it is a collaborative environment; I always study with friends and we help each other out. I was talking to my Penn friend and he said that, if he had a question about a concept the day before an exam, no one would help him because they want him to do badly for the curve. That would never happen at Brown.

CS is also Brown‚Äôs top major as of last year, and Engineering is definitely on the rise (the new engineering building is amazing). At Penn, the school as a whole is definitely more focused on Econ/finance, and I would say you would have better job opportunities in those fields coming out of Brown. 

Lastly, the open curriculum and S/NC are awesome at Brown. You won‚Äôt have that same flexibility at Penn",13,,False,dwij95a,False,False,1522382377.0,2018-03-29 22:59:37
Why should I choose Brown engineering over UPenn?,rakkamar,"CS concentrator, class of '14 here.

Obviously I can't speak to UPenn, but I can say plenty about Brown.

The two best distinguishing things about Brown's CS are 1) the Open Curriculum and 2) the CS department's undergraduate TA program.

I'm sure you've heard plenty about the Open Curriculum if you've looked into Brown much, but it really is just the best thing, especially for people who come in their freshman year knowing exactly what they want to do. Being able to dive straight into your major on day 1 without having to worry about American History or Chemistry or whatever other stuff that you're not going to use throughout your life is amazing. You're also able to take any class pass/fail, which gives you a have a huge degree of freedom to sample classes outside of CS without having to stress about your grade, as long as you still pass. (And honestly, even if you think you're not going to take classes outside of CS, you'd be crazy to try to fit enough man-hours into your week to do that.) Generals are great for people who are still trying to figure their lives out, but if you know CS is where you want to be, you want the Open Curriculum.

The CS department's Undergraduate TA program (UTA) is a much lesser-sung draw to Brown but it might be even better than the Open Curriculum. Basically, once you've taken a class in the CS department, you're able to TA that class the very next year. This does two awesome things. 

First, the TAs that you go to for help know the class inside and out. I took classes in other departments that were TA'd by random graduate students who obviously knew the material, but had no clue about the finer details of the class like the professor, the textbook, how *exactly* the project worked, etc, because they'd never taken the class before and probably didn't even do their undergraduate degree at Brown. Whereas with the UTA program your TAs are going to know the exact things that tend to trip people up about the projects and can give you all sorts of useful advice about the class that other TAs wouldn't be able to.

The other great thing about the UTA program is that you can be a TA as early as your sophomore year. Besides being a great learning opportunity, it looks great on your resume. Everybody is going to do internships or have a cool github or whatever, but TAing isn't something you can do just anywhere. Brown's UTA program is even pretty well known at companies that you'll be interviewing at a few years down the line. I even once went to an interview at a company that recruits pretty heavily from Brown and they expressed surprise that I *hadn't* been a TA yet (I still got the offer).

I could go on about other reasons Brown is amazing, but those are the things that I think distinguish Brown from any other school. Feel free to reply/PM if you have more specific questions.",11,,False,dwhpcqh,False,False,1522351844.0,2018-03-29 14:30:44

What's one thing you wish you knew about Brown before coming here?,bruno92,"Could be outdated info (2014 graduate), but the liberal Brown bubble is real and has serious consequences; I say this as a progressive liberal myself. For example, there is a bit of a stigma when it comes to corporate/business jobs (consulting, finance, working at F500s that aren't ""cool"" silicon valley companies), so no one really talks about it or takes up internships that prepare you for these jobs. But when the job scramble comes, a lot of seniors realize that they actually *would* like to work at one of these places but don't necessarily have the credentials to do so. This is definitely not the case at the other Ivys.

Another consequence of the liberal bubble is how much Brown distorts your expectations/perceptions of reality. Brown has such a special, accepting culture. The flip side of this: you really forget how to deal with all the shitty, prejudiced people that exist in the real world. As a gay Latino, I've been taken aback by how much prejudice I've encountered since graduation. Brown made me assume that all highly-educated people‚Äîespecially those in our generation‚Äîare very socially progressive.

What's one thing you wish you knew about Brown before coming here?,Mimobrok,"Not really what I wish I had known, but more of the things that surprised me.


1. Black people? 

I was expecting to see way more black people on campus, but instead there are lot more asians. There are more asians in my CS class than white people. Half of the grad students I've met are also Chinese. Race means very little here though. 


2. Weather

     It rains a lot in fall and it is pretty cold in the winter. I didn't do much research about Providence's winter since I thought it was going to be very similar to Connecticut, but it seems that being closer to large body of water affects the climate here a lot.


3. Party, alcohol, weed?

     Doesn't really affect your life if you are sub-free. I was expecting loud noise, drunk people etc, but I don't see a lot of them actually. 


4. Getting an A is hard

    Class is not that hard, but people in your class will be insanely good at the subject despite their chill atmosphere.
It doesn't matter if you are a former highschool olympian, everyone who is taking the class chose to do so, and most will do well. And if you don't get an A, you're going straight to B. I miss B+.

The classes are difficult but the open curriculum means you never have to take a class you‚Äôre not interested in which makes difficult classes seem less so. 

I wish I‚Äôd researched the weather more. Not really anything you can do about it, but it is very cold sometimes.

I was worried about the party culture, but in all honesty it‚Äôs very subdued if you want it to be. I personally don‚Äôt really party and I‚Äôve never really been disturbed by it, yet it‚Äôs still there if you‚Äôre into it. 

The Ratty food isn‚Äôt great but Andrews usually has some really good options along with the Blue Room. 

Honestly, if I could go back and get into whatever school I wanted, I couldn‚Äôt see myself enjoying any school more than I do Brown.

At the very least, it certainly worked out well for me, and I am very glad that I went.  However, if going to Brown meant that I would have graduated with a massive amount of debt, I'd have gone to a state school and not looked back.

I don't know your situation, so I can't comment on whether Brown is a good option for you.

Most of my friends were cut throat about the banking jobs/Facebook internships it was actually weird if you weren't doing these things or at least trying to find opportunities...

How does S/NC affect your GPA?,libbyation,"I've taken one class S/NC each semester and haven't had a problem. It helps me prioritize my classes, especially when I've taken five at a time. I have As, Bs, and Cs on my transcript in addition to Ss and NCs. I honestly don't know where most of my peers sit in relation to my collect-them-all transcript, which I think is very valuable to the academic culture here.

Typically you should try to not take concentration classes S/NC, but that's something you work out with your concentration advisor if it's going to be a problem. Taking a class S/NC should be used as a tool; use it to relieve pressure from a stressful class schedule, to take a class in an unfamiliar subject, to prioritize learning instead of grades, or to give yourself room to slack off a bit.

Also note that *technically* Brown doesn't calculate GPAs for students. We get grades, but our transcript doesn't show a number on a 4.0 scale.

How does S/NC affect your GPA?,cant_read_captchas,"You can, in theory, do this. 

Your first question seems to be geared specifically towards GPA calculation and various honors at graduation. Brown only awards the ""magna cum laude"" honor at graduation, based on how many A's and S's with distinction you received. The ""S with distinction"" is given at the professor's discretion (it's within his/her right to give or not give regardless of your performance), and it does not show up on your transcript. You won't know whether you got one unless you go to the registrar and ask.

Personally, I only used s/nc when it was necessary. Once freshman year for a subject I thought I wanted to concentrate in, but wasn't sure yet. Another time when I was taking five classes, I did two of them s/nc, one of which was an independent study, and the other was a graduate seminar. A third time was when I was taking a religious studies class, which was so far removed from my time-consuming major (CS) that it was actually counterproductive to try and do ALL of the work.

If you actually do every class S/NC, it might make things kind of awkward if you decide to apply to grad schools later. Or if your future employer asks you for your GPA.",5,,1514824967.0,ds1fj8d,False,False,1514823317.0,2018-01-01 10:15:17

AMA Request: Someone who has taken/is in the process of taking all classes S/NC,,"Okay, so here's the thing. If you are SURE you are going to be entering an industry where no one will even look at your transcript or ask for a GPA, you can do it. But if not, it's quite risky.

I loved my time at Brown, but I think there was a tendency among some students (and some faculty) to assume that Brown's academic policies would translate well beyond the university. Many people ‚Äì‚Äì especially employers and graduate schools that recruit heavily at Brown ‚Äì‚Äì are aware of the Open Curriculum and the S/NC policy but don't understand how it works. If you choose to take a significant amount of classes S/NC, especially within your concentration, be prepared to explain yourself a lot. It doesn't mean you won't get a job or get into grad school, but it does mean that people won't always understand your transcript or what taking everything S/NC says about your academic choices and curiosity.

I can't tell you how many times outside of Brown I rationalized my decision to take certain (albeit non-concentration) courses S/NC, and someone would say to me, ""Yeah, but doesn't that mean you didn't try that hard? Doesn't that mean that people can just slack?""

AMA Request: Someone who has taken/is in the process of taking all classes S/NC,Tachyon1337,"I know you're not trying to suggest that you're seriously considering doing this, but I'm just trying to provide something on S/NC.

If whoever is reading this comment is not looking for advice, then ignore the paragraph below.

Rumor has it that someone took all their courses S/NC and somehow got into Harvard med... must've been killer rec's. Even if so, this may be the anomaly. If you're in the math or sciences, you would need to do a lot of explaining, perhaps even provide proof that you didn't get all C's. This can be supported if there are Course Performance Reports along with good recommendations and/or relevant extracurricular activities. They'll have to show proof of S with Distinction, which doesn't even show in internal transcripts, but only in a temporary place in Banner.  For industry, research, and grad school, it'll most likely be an uphill battle. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have gotten into grad school if I took all S/NC in engineering, even if I explained the purpose of S/NC.  Do I have proof? No, but for the above areas I mentioned -- which I can only speak for since I concentrated in a similar area -- one would have to think who else they are up against that didn't have the S/NC option in other schools such as MIT (Pass/D/F with a limit and major-related restrictions) and Georgia Tech (Pass/Fail with a limit and possible major-related restrictions).  If you're in engineering, keep in mind that Brown isn't quite known for it, even though it's good (I've met many that responded with ""Brown has engineering?""). Brown is a great university with a great name, but that can only go so far, and your application would require additional support.  I'm going to guess that in other areas, if you take a lot of S/NC courses, you would likely need additional support as well. I'd say (and many would probably agree) that if it's not for a requirement, feel free to take S/NC. It would be easy to explain in that respect.

Seniors and alumni: What do you think of the class ring?,,"My two cents:

To be honest, I think it's a stupid tradition. We had them at my high school, and I really just didn't get it... what was I supposed to prove? That I went to this school? I had a transcript, a diploma and a sweatshirt to prove that. The only time I heard of it coming in handy was when my friend was in a random city and an alum approached her because she recognized the ring on my friend's finger. My friend got some kind of internship as a result of that interaction. Go figure.

At an Ivy (or another top-tier) school, I really don't see what it's meant to accomplish. We have a serious alumni network and dozens of other connections; do we need a ring to prove anything? MIT has its Brass Rat, which has garnered some tradition and lore around it, and I can respect that, but at Brown rings don't seem to garner the same kind of interest.

"America‚Äôs only open curriculum, WRITten off",,"I'm a science major. I'm gearing up for a life in software design. My expectation is that I won't have to write heaps of papers after Brown. But I'm still glad that I was forced to write ‚Äì‚Äì I've learned to write scientific papers, for one, which are quite different in structure and style than the humanities papers I've written for other courses. And now I've been published, so it pays off!

Nonetheless, what your article overlooks is the fact that many people really don't know how to write. I've come across plenty of work by fellow students that really just wasn't very well written. Some of them were studying things that didn't make them write; others were English concentrators. When we graduate and go off into the world, writing will be handy: at the very least, you'll want to write cover letters for job applications.

Writing is a skill that many people will need to succeed in the working world (and even more so in academia). Sure, it's not Brown's job to prepare us for life after college, but it's really the least they can do to get us to write. I agree that more classes should have the WRIT label affixed to their descriptions, but I'm also pretty sure that your advisor can waive the requirement if you've obviously demonstrated your ability to write. And if not, Fiction I is an awesome class.

Look, I love the open curriculum. I think it's one of the best things about Brown. But it's hard to be successful in this day and this age, especially if you don't have family connections or otherwise, and while writing won't guarantee success, it's certainly expected that you can write well.

You might argue that it's antithetical to Brown's goals to force us to take any particular classes (or set of classes), but how would you contrast the writing requirement with a concentration requirement? My concentration has eighteen required courses, and at least a third of them are particular classes that cannot be substituted. Another third are a choice between a handful of classes, and the last third are departmental electives. Should I be offended that the ""open curriculum"" is making me take these six classes if I want my degree in x?

Maybe it's important for scientists to know how to write, especially since they might get published or write a grant. What if they threw a writing for science class in there, or looked at the description for my causal models class, noted that I had to write a couple of long papers, and decided that since this class would help me improve my writing, they'll stick WRIT on it? Would this be any different?

Given that we already have a precedent by requiring specific courses for a concentration, WRIT courses span (nearly?) all the departments in the university, and it's possible to substitute courses, I think we might just be arguing semantics.",2,,False,c6pwe3d,False,False,1350865930.0,2012-10-21 19:32:10

2. No idea, sorry

3. Partying is whatever you want. For me it was often just getting drunk with friends, and occasionally going out to frats and whatnot- more official partys.

4. Pretty manageable, at least for the first year.

5. Vegetarian here, but I understand Jo's spicy-withs (spicy burger with cheese) are pretty great. 

6. I never looked, but I'm sure it is, plus care packages are never out of the question.

7. Depends what you want. The majority of the houses are either on Pembroke Campus or in Keeney quad, with a few exceptions. As far as those two areas go, Keeney tends to be a bit more raucous and noisy, which is awesome if that's what you're looking for, but otherwise I'm sure it'd get tiring.

"Hey /Brown U! I am 2015, and this subreddit makes me so happy! ",kassieplx,"1) Intro cog sci is in fact awesome, my concentration adviser teaches it and she's super cool. It's really not a psych class, but it's related.

2) I don't think so? I've never seen any.

3) Partying is really whatever you make of it. Tbqh, the frat scene is pretty diminutive here. If you want to be involved in it, you can, but I've never experienced any social pressure to be involved in a sorority/ co-ed frat (unless you're on the football team; from what I've heard, you actually have to join Thete if you're on the football team or your life will be no friends general; no idea how true that story actually is), There are also lots of non-frat parties you can go to, as well as alternative parties; ADPhi has Lush Life, which is like a swing dancing party, I'm in Tech House and we'll often have dry, themed parties (last semester we had an awesome Tron-themed party, last year we had a costume party and a video game themed party, etc.). Really, you can find whatever you want.

4)This really depends on the kind of person you are. I've personally had no issues, I know lots of people who are fine. I also know lots of people who have overloaded themselves and had to leave Brown. The courses you're taking have a lot to do with how much free time you have, but it really comes down to how much work you put in/ how much time you're willing to spend on classes.

5) Better Burger Company is pretty good, I like them a lot. They're right on Thayer.

6) Sure, I know they sell it at whole foods

7) As far as the quality of the actual living space, I really loved living in Andrews as a freshman. Big room with a sink and a walk in closet. When it comes to the social scene, it depends on the sort of person you are; Keeney is very social and very loud. I know lots of people who hated Keeney, but if you like partying you'll probably be happy there. Perkins is butts far away, but the people there seem to bond and stay good friends for a long time. It really depends on what you're looking for (this seems to be a trend at Brown...)

Can I appeal for more financial aid for ED? Incoming high school senior wants to ED but is hesitant because of financial reasons.,kluay422,"There‚Äôs no way to appeal before being accepted. Appeals only happen AFTER you receive your initial financial award, which normally comes just after the acceptance letter. I was in a similar situation, and I ended up applying RD because I was so terrified of being accepted ED and then being contractually bound to a school that I couldn‚Äôt afford. Personally, my advice is to hold off and apply RD so you can have more room to argue. I didn‚Äôt accept the offer of admission until I‚Äôd gotten my financial aid appeal granted, and a big portion of my argument was based on how I could still commit to other cheaper schools if Brown wouldn‚Äôt come down enough. It also helps to have offers from other schools that you can show to Brown‚Äôs financial aid office‚ÄîBrown will often price-match the awards of other top-tier schools. If you ED, you won‚Äôt really get those other awards as bargaining chips either. 

Ultimately, just evaluate your confidence. If you feel that your chances of getting in between ED and RD are so drastically different, then ED. If not, then I‚Äôd say wait it out to apply RD so you don‚Äôt end up bound to go there.

Please sign this petition to allow Juniors who have signed leases to live off-campus! (More info in comments),walkedover,"From the petition:


As part of modifications to the housing process due to COVID-19 for the 2020-2021 school year, the Office of Residential Life introduced a waitlist for juniors to request off-campus housing on July 7th. Between July 7th and July 24th, Brown University students continuously reached out to staff members in multiple offices (ResLife, Student and Employee Accessibility Services, Office of Financial Aid, etc.) to petition their cases only to be met with the false promise of getting answers in the future or receiving no reply at all. On July 24, they announced that no additional off-campus permission would be granted to juniors. They wrote: ‚ÄúBecause we now know that we will be able to meet the requirements both for students covered by the housing requirement and seniors who have requested on campus housing, we have closed this waitlist and are not extending additional off-campus permission.‚Äù However, the requirements for students who need off-campus housing for crucial physical and mental health reasons have not been met nor addressed to any extent.

We believe that this decision will negatively impact hundreds of students for the following reasons:

1. Students who have already signed leases will be forced to change their location of study to ‚Äúremote‚Äù to avoid paying for both on-campus and off-campus housing. The lack of communication by ResLife and the misleading off-campus waitlist caused a huge rush to acquire a property, meaning many housing groups were forced to sign leases before they were all gone. Therefore, students going ‚Äúremote‚Äù will not be able to get tested for COVID-19, putting themselves and possibly others at risk. 

2. Living in Providence while being registered as ‚Äúremote‚Äù is additionally against the Student Code of Conduct. Technically, this leaves students with the sole option of paying for both on-campus and off-campus housing, which is simply impossible for the vast majority of students. This should NOT be the only option for students in this situation. 

3. Living off-campus provides security and stability in an unstable time, especially for students with mental health issues and unhealthy home environments. Living on campus amid the possibility that school will get shut down and that people will get sent home will increase stress levels for these students. 

4. Off-campus housing can save students thousands of dollars. This is especially important as many families‚Äô finances have been negatively impacted by COVID-19. Moreover, Brown University raised its tuition this year by 3.75% despite the increase in national unemployment rates and the current economic instability. Together, these financial limitations make Brown University increasingly difficult and inaccessible for all socioeconomic backgrounds to attend.

5. Although ICE recently rescinded their regulations regarding international students and remote learning, the possibility of this regulation being brought up again is not out of the question. Granting off-campus permission may secure a home for many international students and alleviate the unpredictability of deportation throughout the school year. 

For these reasons, we are asking Brown University to allow juniors who have already signed leases to live off-campus this 2020-2021 year. We also hope this will encourage ResLife to reevaluate allowing those with extenuating circumstances to live off-campus for physical and mental health reasons. By signing this petition, you can help hundreds of students stay safe in Providence!",2,,False,fz4d4pz,True,False,1595617978.0,2020-07-24 14:12:58

Computer Science Core Concentration Requirements: Series A or B??,Y2JRedskins,"I personally took series B (CS17 and CS18).

The primary differences I‚Äôve noticed are as follows, (although I obviously can‚Äôt speak as much towards CS15/16):

-Work in CS15/16 is typically done individually whereas work in CS17/18 is done in pairs/threes

-CS15/16 teaches Java and Python whereas CS17/18 teaches Racket and ReasonML in CS17 and Java and Scala in CS18

-CS15/16 teaches entirely (as far as I know?) object-oriented programming, whereas CS17/18 teaches functional programming in CS17 and then teaches object-oriented in CS18. You get to ‚Äúintegrate‚Äù the two when you do Scala later in the semester. Speaking personally, having done some object-oriented programming in high school, I thought functional programming was a really interesting paradigm that changed the way I thought about CS!

-CS15/16 has these really funny skits that pertain to course concepts, and a lot of people come to the first day of CS15 just to see the opening skit!

-CS15/16 has some ‚Äúmagic‚Äù behind the scenes whereas CS17/18 tries not to have any any ‚Äúmagic‚Äù whatsoever. What this means, practically speaking, is that the projects you end up completing in CS15 may look and feel a lot cooler, although you won‚Äôt understand exactly how some of your code works. The projects in CS17/18 may be a bit plainer looking, but they‚Äôre still really interesting and you‚Äôll be able to understand every piece of your project from the ground up.

Overall, choosing between the two is just a matter of preference. You won‚Äôt be behind at all if you choose to take one sequence over the other. They are both very popular classes, and are very similar with regard to workload. I‚Äôd recommend shopping both CS15 and CS17 in the fall during shopping period to see which one you prefer!

I'm taking Series A right now. 15 was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Brown. I don't think 16 is a particularly well-structured class but the professor is changing and some of my issues with 16 are exacerbated by virtual learning.

15 has no tests because all of the programing is individual, 17/18 has tests I believe. 16 has tests although we're not taking them because of coronavirus. I'm taking 16 S/NC as of last week. 

Andries van Damn teaches 15, which is part of why it's so famous. He literally started the CS department at Brown, was the second person in the country to get a PhD in CS, has done really important research etc, but is mainly known among students for being the inspiration for naming Andy from Toy Story (several of his students went on to teach at Pixar!)

Help Deciding,cats_and_wines,"I studied physics at Brown, worked in defense scientific software for a year, now starting PhD in physics this year.

If you study up to the level of PhD in physics, your job prospects are fantastic! Your thesis could have been in string theory and finance companies are still going to want you to do their stock market prediction models. Professorship is harder to get than ever, but many industry research arms are often looking for a physics PhD. If you are strategic, your thesis could be quite related to your job (basically if you do solid state research, semiconductor giants and quantum computing companies will welcome you with open arms). If you do computational research, transitioning into software is crazy easy (tbh this is true even if you don't do computational research). There are also national labs that are hungry for new PhDs--their trouble is attracting talent to live in the middle of nowhere, which can also be said for many defense giants.

Even if you stop after your bachelors, if you know how to program, you will still have an easy time finding a job. I took only 3 coding classes at Brown (none in CS), and did some computational physics research, and had tons of job offers for software/data science positions from big corporations. I don't know much about GTech, but Brown physics students have top grad school placements and Brown CS students have top industry placements. Anecdotally (from people whose outcomes I know personally), the most popular PhD destinations for physics students are Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and most popular CS placements are Google, Microsoft, and FB.

I think EE/CE at Brown is also pretty great, though I can't speak a ton on it because I don't know as many people in EE or CE. I know one EE who got grad offers from UChicago and Columbia and chose to go to Columbia. The one CE I know ended up at Microsoft (they were kind of pivoting towards comp sci near graduation though). I heard that quite a few EEs end up at Boeing every year.

At the end of the day, individual field rankings at these schools don't matter for undergrad (they matter more on grad school level). Just go for what your gut feeling is telling you, and you'll do great no matter what your choice may be!",5,,1587608742.0,fo913lw,False,False,1587608176.0,2020-04-22 21:16:16

Help Deciding,stevetheindian,"I know you asked a very pointed question but I wanted to provide a different view, take it or leave it. The two schools are different in so many more respects than what you mentioned. There's the simple fact that Brown is a smaller (and much more undergrad-focused) school. Georgia Tech has incredibly prolific professors producing world-leading research but you might have a harder time getting their attention relative to their armies of master's/PhD students.  Georgia Tech will have a very wide variety of classes on offer, with deep branches across several fields of CS/physics. However, most class sizes there will be much much larger and the learning experience will be more impersonal or at least very different. You will be able to develop relationships with Brown professors much more easily, and Brown is overflowing with research opportunities for undergrads, with the potential for you to have a large say in what problems you want to work on/who you want to work with. You'll find that there is one excellent seminar on reinforcement learning as opposed to perhaps many more in Georgia Tech, but you will likely have a much bigger role in the one at Brown. It's quite an interesting tradeoff.

With regards to job opportunities, grads from very selective schools (top 15 in terms of acceptance rates) get good placements in pretty much every field by virtue of the school's reputation in general as well as the rigor of the programs (for example it is almost a rule for a large chunk of Brown history/other humanities students to have jobs out of college at Bain/McKinsey/BCG/Goldman - even though finance was not their specialization in any sense). There is no reason to be worried about a job/grad school placement, and the differences with Georgia Tech's CS/physics placements are likely marginal. You are next to guaranteed to get an interview at any tech company you'd like, after which your classes (particularly CS157) will have prepared you very well for problem-solving. In my year close to half of graduating CS students who self-reported placements went to Google.

If you crave a big-school experience, Georgia Tech is the way. If you think you might benefit from being at a smaller school, Brown is a no brainer.",4,,False,fo9o4gp,False,False,1587625402.0,2020-04-23 02:03:22

Climbing @ Brown?,SusFool,"In terms of a climbing team/club there currently isn't one unfortunately. The outing club runs a ""Sunday night climbing"" trip every Sunday to one of the local gyms, but this is more geared towards giving exposure to beginners cuz as you know most people want to go more than once a week!

However, despite the lack of an on-campus gym and a climbing team, there's a pretty active community of climbers, and the two most popular gyms in the area, Central Rock Gym and Rock Spot, are filled mostly with Brown students every afternoon and weekend. Rock Spot is within biking distance, and only offers bouldering. CRG is a little bigger and has everything, but is also a ~15 minute drive away. Providence is also home to Lincoln Woods which has some of the sickest bouldering in the northeast: https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105913161/lincoln-woods

Just recently (after going home because of COVID19), I was contacted by some people working on starting a team here at Brown, and I think people have been talking about making this happen for as long as I've been here (I'm a freshman), so hopefully a team will form in the near future, but I have no idea how long this would take to happen, especially considering recent events.

Hopefully you decide to come to Brown!!! We'd love to have some more sweet climbers in the community. If you have any questions about climbing or outdoors in general at Brown feel free to pm me!

Climbing @ Brown?,External-Total,"Hi. I don‚Äôt know how reddit works haha but I was asked by some people to respond to this. I am assisting in leading the climbing club and have been an active climber with multiple groups around campus. The dedicated climbing club is just getting underway but as for climbers who are serious about climbing there are many who already go climbing on a regular basis. Sadly, Brown does not have a competition team nor their own wall for training but a few of us have begun training at rock spot and CRG multiple times (4-5) per week. Both of these gyms are wonderful for training. Admittedly, rock spot is quite small and only hosts bouldering but there is plenty of climbing to be had and the route setters set multiple times. CRG is great for bouldering and has too roping and sport climbing but the walls are a tad short for any serious top roping.

We're pushing for club and potentially club sport recognition next year, so we're aiming to compete on the USA Collegiate Climbing circuit next year.

Like others have mentioned, Brown financial aid tends to only match a select number of schools. Mainly Ivies/Stanford/MIT/Duke/UChicago. Of course, if the scholarships you received from WashU and Vandy were **merit-based**, this will not be matched by Brown (a strictly **need-based** institution). My friends have had varied experiences with their aid fluctuating over the years, so consider what u/Rostifar said regarding package changes.

biol 200 for a premed??,JimmyTheCrossEyedDog,"I never did AP bio, so I filled in a bit of my knowledge gaps during the summer to pass the placement test and had no issues skipping it. I took Genetics sophomore year and then TA'ed it the following two years, so that went fine, too.

But, I wasn't pre-med (I went into a bio adjacent field so I didn't feel like I'd be anything if there were a couple holes in my knowledge). If there's anything foundational that you might need for the MCAT and don't have under your belt, it may be unwise to skip it.

The other thing I'd say is:

> my other classes next semester will be pretty heavy and it would be better if i didn't take a biol class next semester

This seems like a bad reason to skip it. If you think it would be a struggle on top of a heavy courseload, that seems like an indication that you *shouldn't* skip it, because if you're ready to skip it, it'd be an easy class to top off a heavy semester. Sort of a catch 22 - the fact that you're scared to add it onto a heavy semester is the very reason you should perhaps take it.

To increase your chances, you need to learn the course materials and have a high GPA. The acceptance rate for all applicants was 41.9%. Brown has a med school acceptance rate of [92%](https://www.brown.edu/about/brown-glance).

Successful premeds actually learn the course materials well (not just pass the course). If you skip a prerequisite, you might not have the time to catch up while taking the next course. Each person is different. You must make course selection decision yourself. I have a group of close friends who have finished all the premed courses in two years but it doesn't mean everyone can/should do that. Even 4.0 GPA applicants take a gap year these days (someone I know got into multiple med schools recently including Alpert). You should not rush to take a course simply because you see others are taking. Those failed premeds usually failed because they made wrong decisions choosing courses they can't handle. Everyone here wants you to be successful. If you are taking CHEM 330 now, using that as the  benchmark to see where you stand and adjust future course load accordingly.  BIOL 0470 has a large number of upperclassmen (37.42% - Junior, 29.68% - Senior) so the margin of error is much smaller compared to orgo (when I took orgo I, the orgo exam 3 average was 53).",1,,1572359528.0,f5pdhft,False,False,1572356605.0,2019-10-29 08:43:25

"Admitted ED, wondering about a couple of things",thebensilv,"I don't know all the answers and I could be wrong about some of these things but I'll answer what I can.

1) You will receive information about different things at different times. If I remember correctly though, you will receive a big packet of information once RD decisions come out. This will include information about accounts and housing, however, you only fill out the housing form in May/June and get your housing in August. The packet should have a link in it, allowing you to create your google and brown account. Once you have your Brown account you will be able to get adobe creative cloud for free. 

2) Brown does give unlimited Google Drive space.

3) Personally, I don't think you need it. I'm a freshman right now and I'm in CS but also love filmmaking. Therefore, I brought this huge monitor for my dorm so I could video edit on it. The reality is, I never use it because I am never in my dorm and literally just sleep there. There are people who work in their dorm but I prefer working in libraries and therefore I've gotten used to just doing everything on my laptop. Also, many times you may want to stay up late working and your roommate will be trying to sleep, making it impossible to really work on a big computer in your room. 

4) I know I saw when ADOCH will be at some point, but I can't seem to find it now either. I'm sure more information will come out once RD comes out. If I remember correctly though, ADOCH this year will be 3 weekends, two of which will be the full two-day program and one which will just be a single day program for those who can only come for a day. As far as the actual event schedule, that comes out only a few weeks before ADOCH. I went last year and it was a great time and I highly recommend you go! However, just a heads up, if things haven't changed since last year, as an ED admit you won't be given housing, you'll either have to find someone to stay with or get a hotel or something.

First College Finals! Advice/Help please!,Amazon421,"As a math concentrator (and middle and high school math teacher), these are things I found helped and passed on to my students. Some have been found helpful in scientific studies (*) and others are just anecdotal (**). 

* Memories are tied stronger to scent. Study with a reproducible scent in the background. I use mint because it ties in with my next tip.

* Chew gum while studying and taking tests. It makes you smarter. Use mint gum and you can kill two tips with one act. 

* Write out your important notes (ie definitions, theorems, etc). Write out things that are confusing you. The act of writing uses different parts of the brain and causes you to remember and understand better than just reading or listening. You can use one as note cards to carry everywhere when done. Don't go anywhere without some notes. Even bathroom. 

** Teach difficult things to other students. When we teach it forces us to look at things differently. It also causes a greater understanding. Take turns with even one other person and teach each other parts you guys don't get.

** Don't stress out. You brain will go into fight out flight and neither of them have to do with chemistry or whatever exam. Stress causes us to lose short term memory. So calmly plan out the next few days and don't over stuff things. Look into the pomidoro technique or download one of the few timers from the app store (I know they're there if you've got Android). Your brain needs a chance to process the information, so take breaks. Just don't procrastinate and let the break become the whole afternoon. 

** How close to failing are you? So close that it's a Hail Mary to pass these classes? Look at what classes you are most likely to pass and what you need the most. If push comes to shove, what class can you fail? If it's really necessary, is there a class you can just ignore and focus the rest of your attention elsewhere? Make educated use of your time. 


Good luck with everything. I'm so glad I don't have to deal with exams any more. I'm such a procrastinator, every semester I'd tell myself I'd do better the next semester. HA! I think that only worked half the time.

If you're around for the summer, there are more funding mechanisms (such as summer UTRAs), and some professors will pay undergrads for their work directly.

How is Political Science at Brown?,notphia,"I'll add on with specifics, since I have this question as well.

How is the quality of professors and instruction? Brown is famous/infamous (depending on your perspective) for its liberal bent, but how does that look in the Political Science department? Are professors willing to look at multiple sides of issues, or do you get the feeling that they are pushing an agenda more so than they are exploring a subject? Not to say that they aren't allowed to inject personal beliefs, but do you feel that this impacts your education/grasp of a subject in a one-sided or negative way?

Also, are the classes more lecture-style or discussion-based? What does homework look like? How accessible are resources/professors if needed for help or advising? Also, If you've had interesting research opportunities, I would love to know about them. 

I'm excited about the school because of what seems like a positive, collaborative academic environment with lots of freedom. However, I can also see how the grading systems might create a lazy or less serious/ambitious underbelly, and that perhaps a high GPA from Brown might be taken less seriously because of the perception of grade inflation. It seems like the safety net for failure might just be too big, and that may have negative ramifications on the legitimacy of a Brown education. This is just speculation, though, and I'd like to know what actual Brown students think of all this.

What made you ultimately decide on political science at Brown, over another concentration or university? Is there anything you wish you had known before selecting this path?

Why does Brown have a Significantly Lower Salary than Other Ivy League Colleges?,drfoqui,"I was a grad student at Brown so I don't think I can give an accurate answer to your second question. The best I can say is that I have met people in CS, APMA, and Econ, and I think it's a great combination to study at Brown.

Back to your first question, sure, both Harvard and Brown are Ivies but that does not mean they are identical. And as much as Brown is a very prestigious university, Harvard is a step above.

But, this really doesn't matter to you, you have to think about Brown and Duke. About that, I would encourage you to take a look at [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html) (interestingly, coauthored by a Brown professor): it shows how different colleges compare in terms of what socioeconomic background their students come from and how they do later in life. You can make the tables show you Duke and Brown and you'll see that they look fairly similar in that regard but Brown seems to be a bit more successful in making its students who come from the bottom 40% of the income distribution make it to the top 40%.

So all in all, I would just try to figure out which one of the two feels like the best fit for you personally. If you are happy at the university you choose, you'll do better, and that's gonna have a big impact in how you fare afterwards.

As far as traditional secret societies go, secrecy is valuable as a form of social currency.

However, secrecy is cumbersome, and it's extraordinarily difficult to keep a secret social society going if it does not have some form of permanent meeting space. Brown's greek letter organizations are granted semi-permanent space in the dorms on Wriston Quad.

Brown Vs. Upenn for a Student Pursuing a Dual Degree (Concentration) in English and Computer Engineering or CompSci,aulisaulisaulis,"Congratz on your admits!

Let me see if I can address some of your concerns. 

* I'm concentrating in apma\-cs and chemistry, and I can even find time to take one or two electives every semester. If you are big on interdisciplinary \(or just multidisciplinary\) studies, Brown definitely gets points in this category. 
* I was also cross\-admitted to Penn, but in one of their formal dual\-degree programs. My sister also attended Penn in that same program, but she said that even though she got to take a lot of interesting courses in two different fields, she had very few opportunities for other kinds of academic exploration and many of her peers had to stay longer to complete the program. 
* I think one major thing the Open Curriculum opens doors to is upper level courses in other departments. Prereqs aren't really a thing at Brown \(except for certain intro STEM courses, and even those can be negotiable sometimes\), so freshman spring, I found myself in an advanced East Asian studies seminar, along with a technical course in linguistic models. I don't think you can do that at many other peer institutions, and I think **this is what really sets Brown apart**. At other schools, you may be able to explore intro courses, but where's the fun in that?
* That said, the Brown experience is definitely as good as you make it. I wouldn't say that the guidance is very good, or even encourages this kind of exploration. You definitely need to put the time into exploring the course catalog to the fullest, and definitely make use of shopping period. I have friends who shop upwards of 10 courses.
* I don't think the dorms are really that bad, but quality definitely ranges across a pretty wide spectrum. It really depends on your luck. I live in Perkins, theoretically the least desirable sophomore/junior building, but honestly, it isn't that bad. I would suggest not working that much in your room, and finding different places on campus to do work \(like 4th floor of the CIT, ERC lobby, the CLPS building, etc.\)
* I really like the CS department at Brown. It's pretty decently ranked as well \(not that that even matters\), but I think it differs from other schools in that it doesn't feel as stressful an environment. It's true that CS courses have a lot of work, and that it's often hard to finish without going to hours, but if you manage your time well and get on things early, it's really not so bad. Most people are pretty friendly and open to helping as well.
* I also enjoy creative writing, so I've taken a few literary arts courses here. Something notable is that the majority of them are mandatory S/NC, which I've noticed actually makes me more willing to take more risks in my writing and really develop my own creativity and writing skills in a different way.
* I know very little about the sports / music scenes here \(welp\), but many of my \(STEM\) friends are involved in music, and it seems like the majority of active musicians are actually STEM here, which is pretty cool, in my opinion. There's a ton of opportunities to get involved in student\-run productions or small music groups. Brown's music department can set you up with a chamber group, as well, if you're interested in that.
* Your last concern about political landscape is one I myself wondered about during my own decision process. I can assure you that it really isn't as big a deal as people make it out to be. Especially in STEM, nobody's going to prosthelytize for the alt\-left or anything. People are just more conscious about social issues. My friends and I \(and many other people\) often make fun of the ultra\-liberalism, but I really haven't experienced it that much myself. You might hear the occasional buzzword \(like ""heteronormativity""\) thrown around though.
* Finally, Yale sucks lmao. I get it, I'm biased, but I really think that some of the uniquely\-Brown things make it a great place ‚Äî but not necessarily for everyone. It just depends on what you're looking for.

Hope that helps! Good luck on your decision! If you have any more questions, definitely feel free to ask away.",8,,False,dy733bk,False,False,1525060406.0,2018-04-29 22:53:26

What is it like to be on academic warning?,H4WKWARD,"Hey! Fellow fuck-up here! How's it going. 

First of all, don't beat yourself up. Really identify what went wrong and how you can avoid those problems in the future. Do some introspection. 

I was on Academic Warning for a while, then Serious Warning. You meet with some people, you discuss plans, you have an awkward conversation with your folks, and then you carry on with life at Brown as usual, only the stakes are a teeny tiny bit higher. 

I never did get my shit together, and I actually got suspended. I took a year and a half and figured some things out about my life and came back and will be graduating in two weeks (!!!) so that worked out fine for me too. 

Yep, it all went on my transcript. I'm still going to grad school in the fall, in a fairly prestigious program in a STEM field. So if you're concerned about that, don't be. 

Tell your parents about the fact that your academic standing may change, just in case. Talk to a Dean of the College about it, too, if you haven't already, just to fill them in/ask for advice/know what may or may not happen. I recommend Dean Cohen, Dean Dennis, or Dean Targan. The DoC office is your friend. 

Email the professors teaching online courses NOW. Right now. Let them know you're interested and ask if there's a waitlist. If there is, you want to be on it right now. Is there something preventing you from sticking around and taking a physical summer course, out of curiosity? 

You will probably not have to take a summer class AND 5 classes in the fall to return to good standing, even if you fail both. The amount of make-up you'll have to do, in what timeframe, pretty much depends on your semester level. (What is your semester level? Also, how many classes have you taken/passed so far?)

Overall, being on AW or SW is not the worst thing in the world. Not even close. Form a relationship with someone in the DoC, form a relationship with your advisor. Don't bite off more than you can chew in coming semesters. And take ENGN 9 anyway, it's a great class and who knows how long Hazeltine's still going to be around.

What is it like to be on academic warning?,herpiderpmyherpderp,"I was on warning because I left Brown (with no intention of coming back) and didn't take one of my finals. I then transferred back and...yet again, didn't take a final. Ended up putting me on serious warning. Wasn't a big deal. Had to meet with like one person.

They told me it doesn't get put on your external transcript until the level after ""serious warning"" (still goes on internal). 

At any rate, I did pretty poorly that first semester back. Really hated Brown (still do, but I'm graduating so fuck y'all). Anyway, it's just like a ""start improving...or else"" kind of thing. Not ""you're in big trouble NOW"". Once I got the serious warning I started working harder and got a 4.0 and I never heard from Brown about it again. 

I would recommend against taking extra courses unless you have to in order to graduate or to get off the warning. But from what I understand it will go away with time automatically. You clearly have trouble managing a workload, no need to do extra (especially in CS). 

But yeah, my advice to you is to not take school so seriously. Brown is a bullshit oh-my-god-my-future environment and you just need to not buy into that shit. You had a hard semester--happens to everyone--and you'll learn from it, just like I did. What I learned was to to take courses I'm actually interested in (i.e. not upper-division physics and math and instead computer science and computer engineering) and to care more about the material rather than the grades/bullshit. Got me a 4.0 in the end. 

You didn't fuck up; you learned something about yourself and you should go with it. And don't worry so much man. And if your parents give you a hard time, then they're idiots. Fuck them. You're doing fine. Just identify the issues (i.e. don't go OH MY GOD I NEED TO TAKE MORE TO FIX THIS but instead go MAYBE I TOOK TOO MUCH HOW CAN I BALANCE SHIT BETTER).

Lastly, people don't really fail at Brown unless they don't do the work. If you do the work and do reasonably well you'll pretty much get a C at worst. So your issues might be non-issues (and may have come to pass given that this is 4 days later).

I don't think so. You receive credit for a course called AP Euro, but, as stated, AP credit will not increase your course credit total. So, it's a credit, but doesn't count toward your 30 course total. Seems consistent to me.

Sounds to me like the purpose of the AP Euro credit is if you are in a concentration which requires history courses (but isn't the History concentration), you can use AP Euro to fulfill one of those requirements as long as you take another 1000-level course as well.

>  if Stanford, which has deep resources and a reputation as a factory for Olympians, can't maintain its sports programs amid the pandemic, no one can. I sympathize with your feelings

I don't have strong feelings about the existence of Brown athletics in the first place, as I don't participate in them whatsoever, and I don't know anyone who does. I think collegiate athletics as a whole might be inequitable and wasteful, and they might not be worth funding in the first place.

But that is besides the point. I think you're heavily, heavily misconstruing the story here. If you read the article in full, this is about gender equity and Title IX, not about whether to play during the pandemic. 

> For those of you who have to play your sport now and care about this so much, you probably should try to transfer to a school in the Southeastern CoronaConference like University of Alabama.

Nobody here is arguing that sports shouldn't be cancelled. All sport events should most certainly be cancelled indefinitely. I'm arguing, and what the story is about, is that Brown has a court-mandated responsibility to maintain a certain number of women's teams in proportion to men's, and it's using the pandemic as a way around that.

The Title IX rulings stipulate that Brown must have the same ratio of women's to men's teams. The ratio would be fixed by reinstating women's teams, or cutting men's teams.

Because this issue was brought up only after  men‚Äôs track, field and cross country teams were reinstated.

I would suggest that you think about if you want to do nursing 100%. Nursing is a rich field with lots of diverse opportunities. However, it does kind of pigeon hole your undergraduate experience. If you discover you love something else other than nursing it won't be impossible but it may be more challenging to pivot or spin your experience for that.

For example, if you realized you loved computer science or biostatistics. Your nursing curriculum in a BSN won't give you a ton of flexibility to explore and become well-trained in that area.

All I'm trying to say is that there's a reason why getting a traditional bachelor's degree is popular‚Äî if you're uncertain as many high school students are (and often should be) about what they want the bulk of their life would look like.

math+cs qualms,US_Govt_Is_Corrupt,"The professors in applied math at Brown are generally very passionate, available, and clear in their teaching. The same cannot be said for the pure math professors, although this is not to say that you get less out of the pure math classes or they are less enjoyable. I know some math students who actually prefer the more ""dry"" style and appreciate that most of the learning comes from the homework/textbook anyway, so to some extent it's up to personal preference. 

In terms of advice, I'd say that since the pure math courses are generally more difficult than the applied math courses (both in time spent and in level of thinking), you might want to do APMA + CS since then you should have plenty of time and energy for your other chem/bio related interests. Plus, you see way more connections between applied math courses and CS courses, at least if you go down the machine learning track.

math+cs qualms,cats_and_wines,"Hey I'm quite familiar with the pure math dept (started off flirting with the idea of concentrating in math, and have lots of friends in pure math). I personally liked the pure math dept over apma because pure math is smaller and the community is tighter knit. I actually know a lot of people who ultimately concentrated in something else while taking lots of upper level pure math classes--most commonly CS and physics students, though I also know chemistry, linguistics, geology, classics, poli sci students who did so as well--myself included. As a person starting PhD, I think undergrad is a unique opportunity to really explore your passions, whatever that may be, and Brown in particular gives you all the tools to do so with the Open Curriculum.

I wandered about a lot in my time at Brown because I had so many interests and changed my concentration/life goals pretty much every semester. Like you, my interests spanned math, international relations, chemistry, statistics, and physics. Physics came easiest to me, with chemistry and math coming in second, and ultimately I graduated in Chemical Physics with 2 courses shy of doubling in pure math. I actually think that my highly interdisciplinary background counted in my favor when applying to physics PhD programs (particularly since I hope to focus on materials physics). The interests you mention are also highly interdisciplinary, so I would imagine it would also be in your favor for you as well.

As for career options, most companies are not looking for any one specific concentration but rather specific skills (i.e. data analysis, programming, knowledge of certain softwares, certain lab techniques). To give an example, I am now working as a software developer despite having taken only 3 programming classes (none in CS dept).

Do you have any specific questions about the grad apps/career stuff?

As for my story, I graduated in May '19, have been in industry since June '19, and will be starting PhD in Sept '20. I was originally not planning on going to grad school due to some negative experiences in academia, so I went through tech recruiting season which happen in early fall, got offers, and accepted an offer to start once I graduate. Then I joined a research lab to do my senior thesis, which is required to be considered for honors, in my last semester at Brown. I ended up liking the research lot more than I expected and decided to go to grad school after all. Since grad app season was already past, I applied this past winter. In retrospect, I think my application was stronger for it because I managed to raise my GPA via my senior year grades (I had a bad sophomore year which tanked my GPA). I would have applied with a 3.62 if I applied in my senior year vs 3.70 (just barely making the generally understood ""cutoff"" mark for the most selective schools) which I had upon graduation. Additionally, I formed a really great relationship with my thesis advisor whose rec letter was most certainly the deciding factor for my successful application season.

As for how common this is, the majority generally go straight from undergrad to grad program, but I would say a significant number take couple gap years like me. Those on Fulbright or other kinds of fellowships will also take 1~2 years off doing their fellowships, though I guess that's not quite the same as working regular jobs. People who take >5 yrs between undergrad and grad are rarer, but not nonexistent either.

I had great bosses.

As for what those jobs actually are, metadata is a lot of spreadsheets. Basically, it's making data findable through the search engine. Circulation is checking books in and out, specifically undergrads pull books other libraries and professors request and get them ready to be shipped or put them on the hold shelf, and they check in incoming books from other libraries. There's also finding and scanning articles that only exist in print for other libraries and getting stuff ready for course reserves, and other miscellaneous stuff.

I really loved my time at Brown and professors are super supportive and awesome! My senior thesis advisor is the best human ever and a terrific advocate :) The environment is super relaxed, and you will end up in very small groups (because Brown physics is a small dept) which means that you will generally get a ton of attention from your advisor. You might also end up mentoring to some capacity an undergrad in your lab (though usually professors take charge in mentoring undergrads as well, so the role you might play would be teaching certain techniques and making sure the undergrad doesn't destroy the lab lol).

Btw, every department has some professors who are amazing and some that probably you should avoid. This is not limited to Brown, since I've gotten similar answers at my other schools in my physics PhD program search. Ask other grad students (or feel free to ask me!) if there are any that you should avoid.

Freshman Math Placement,umlolman,"Ah yes, I remember being in your shoes a year ago. I'm a first year atm and this is my experience: 

This semester I was in MATH 1530, 1260, and 0540 plus PHYS 0470. I was also in a DRP in the math department doing Teichmueller theory. Next semester is MATH 1270 and 1540 plus PHYS 0500 and 2100 and then I'm doing an independent reading with a postdoc in the physics department in a book called ""Geometry, Topology, and Physics"". So yes it is feasible. 

You don't have to ""place out"" per say. Simply pick where you think would be an appropriate starting point and email the professor that's teaching the course next fall and ask for an override code. That's what I did. They'll ask your background and all that but if you're confident they'll definitely give you the code. 

I'd say a nice starting point is: 1530 and 0540. If you would like a taste of analysis then 1260 for complex analysis or 1130 for multivariate analysis. 1010 is offered in the spring but is a ""primer"" for real analysis since its only of a single variable and doesn't require linear algebra for the proofs. 0540 is linear algebra and is an essential building block of modern mathematics so DO NOT skip that. It may seem trivial but you have to see it at least once. 1530 has 0540 as a prereq but that's not actually true. Abstract algebra studies multiple types of structures and doesn't actually use anything from 0540. 

In terms of rigor - it is mathematics. It is rigorous. How many roots does a polynomial of degree n have? It has at most n. But you have to prove it. If f is a holomorphic function in a domain then it is automatically infinitely differentiable. Welp - gotta prove that. On an exam if you state something it better have been proven in the course, on the homework, or you can produce the proof on the spot. It may be ""obviously"" true but it does indeed require proof. And not everything is ""obviously"" true. Remember continuity? You'd assume every continuous real valued function has at least one derivative right? Nope, not true. There is indeed a counter example. 

I latexed all my psets so if you wanna see more examples of what actual proof based mathematics looks like, want advice, or would simply like to talk about this - feel free to pm me. Not many people have this question and when I was in this spot god knows I'd of wanted someone that could answer cause figuring it out yourself isn't fun.",8,,False,fb2f37z,False,False,1576449894.0,2019-12-15 16:44:54
Freshman Math Placement,wlfgngpck,"So I think your question basically has two parts.  1) what are the upper level math classes like?  2) will they allow you to place into them (if applicable)?

The second question is easier so I‚Äôll start with that.  The answer is yes.  I remember skipping whatever the 2nd semester calculus was (Math 10?) and all I really did was call Joe Silverman (who was the department chair at the time) prior to registering for classes, and he basically said instructor permission will always let you into a class.  I know someone who was in Abstract Algebra (Math 153?) during fall of their freshman year.

The first question is harder because it‚Äôs kinda dependent on the course and on the instructor.  But speaking as generally as possible, the focus in pure math is more on proofs than on calculation.  It‚Äôs very hard to give undergraduates the full context (just because there‚Äôs so much that happens over the four years and even more so beyond), but a simple example might be ‚Äúprove that 0a=0 for any integer a.‚Äù  It gets more complicated the longer you go, but I think that at least gives you a bit of the flavor.

I never really took applied math at Brown, but having had some courses in it at other schools, the focus is more on techniques to solve nontrivial problems, both theoretically but also practically (it helps no one if your solution to a problem would take 100 years to run).

I have no real experience with computer science (all I know on the programming side is self taught) so I‚Äôll let someone else answer about that.",3,,False,fb1n56c,False,False,1576438709.0,2019-12-15 13:38:29

I also need to issue a warning from personal experience: math was actually my easiest STEM class this semester, but that does not mean it's easy to juggle alongside computer science. CSCI 0190 (cs019) was a HUGE time commitment and really detracted from my work in other classes. If you're deadset on double concentrating I recommend an easier intro sequence. I had relatively little math preparation in HS, mostly self-studying, and did MATH 0350, and over half of my classmates had already taken both multi and linear in HS.

HS Senior applying Brown ED. How much does the intended major on your application matter?,aulisaulisaulis,"For me personally, I‚Äôm kind of ancient at this point, but I wrote about being able to explore different academic interests ‚Äî and also how that lends itself really well to interdisciplinary learning.

More tangibly, I‚Äôve been able to do so much because of the Open Curriculum, and I will be forever thankful to Brown for that. I‚Äôve taken one fun elective every semester, while also concentrating in APMA/CS and being premed. 

Among others, I‚Äôve taken east asian studies courses, a gender studies course, and an upper level linguistics seminar on literally semantics (I thought that was kind of funny). Another big thing is the lack of concrete prerequisites in many departments, or the easy ability to ‚Äúskip‚Äù them. I‚Äôm currently in a history seminar with a hunch of history concentrators and a comparative literature course with mostly humanities concentrators. Where else could you do this, while also being able to focus on your own primary field of study?

Another observation is that Brown students in CS are rarely just CS. I know of students concentrating in CS and theater, CS and visual arts, CS and classics, and almost any combination. I think Brown fosters an environment where students are comfortable exploring vastly different disciplines, and this is what I love about Brown and the people here.

I don‚Äôt think that writing about CS is bad ‚Äî I would suggest also writing about other of your interests (and maybe how they could combine together, and how the open curriculum gives you the ability to explore more exotic combinations that will give you a unique perspective to tackle some of the world‚Äôs biggest problems).

Sub-free housing regrets,fruitysmoothie20,"Hey OP! I completely hear you out on your concerns. 

If you‚Äôve opted for sub-free housing, chances are you‚Äôll be placed in New Pembroke 4. It‚Äôs a dorm comprised of approximately 80 people, and it‚Äôs completely sub-free. There are other freshman dorms (in Keeney, Andrews, etc.) that designate certain floors to be sub-free, so there‚Äôs also some chance you‚Äôll be placed there! 

I lived in New Pembroke 4 my freshman year, so maybe I can help shed some insight. I absolutely loved living there‚Äîfrom the private, single-lock bathrooms to the tight-knit friend groups formed with fellow dormmates, everything about NP4 is actually quite great. I never felt that living in NP4 impeded my ability to make lots of good friends‚Äîits smaller size actually fosters some really great friendships as well as a super wholesome social scene! If that appeals to you, NP4 can be a great fit! 

Unrelated, but other huge NP4 pros: a minute‚Äôs walk away from CVS and Blue State Coffee, relatively quiet living (the noises on Thayer actually aren‚Äôt bad at all!), and proximity to the Nelson/VDub/Andrews/every freshman dorm on North Campus!

You will not be forced to mainly interact with a select group of people, and just because people choose to be sub-free doesn't mean that they are not socially inclined! There are so many opportunities for you to interact with so many different groups of people at Brown, and so the dorm experience, although important, wouldn't be the only social circle that you'd be exposed to! I personally find living in a sub-free dorm quite nice, since I can choose to hang out with my not sub-free friends anytime that I want, and still have a sub-free community that I feel comfortable with and that I can truly call home. New Pembroke 4 last year and the year before that have been a really wholesome community, and everyone was just very friendly and always looking out for each other.

Should I apply to Brown ED if I need a substantial amount of financial aid?,mattblau,">**I'm worried that I will not get enough financial aid. Should I apply ED or RD?**

ED is not legally binding. Brown can't make you come here or give them money. It's super valid to turn down an ED acceptance due to financial constraint; it's probably *the* most valid reason in the admission office's eyes. I know of a few people who turned down their ED acceptance because they couldn't afford it, and went on to other schools in RD. 

All other admission factors held constant, your best shot at getting into Brown is through ED. Do ED. 

>**how negotiable is Brown when it comes to financial aid?**

Can premed students share experiences with advising?,JJKKLL10243,"You can find the number of applicants from Brown at [https://www.aamc.org/data/facts/applicantmatriculant/](https://www.aamc.org/data/facts/applicantmatriculant/).  At least for the last 3 years I have been monitoring the number, the number of applicants from Brown remains pretty stable. This application cycle there are 235 applicants from Brown. Pre-health advising knows the qualifications needed to be admitted to med schools. Only qualified applicants get a committee letter. The article you linked basically tells you for those who are not qualified, they won't get it. There is no structural flaw.  All the schools at this level have committee letter system. If Brown has ""structural flaws"" in pre-health advising, all the schools at this level have the same structural flaws. This system benefits the applicants who have the committee letter, which shows institutional support. Two third of applicants from Ivies have at least one gap year. Gap year is not needed if you are a very strong applicant. Last year one person I know got into Harvard Medical School with no gap year. Again, they will advise you if you are a strong applicant or not. In my opinion, PLME program is good for us because PLMEs are not applying out. Brown's life sciences programs are extremely strong. More than one fifth of students are in life and medical sciences.

Personally, I've had a pretty neutral experience with the advising structure. It is definitely well organized and built to maximize top admits, but I know that people feel put off by advising, since the advisors tend to push you to doing everything required to ""check all of the boxes"". It isn't a bad thing at all, and helps people organize themselves earlier for a stronger application, but students see it as additional stress or a lack of faith in their potential for success.

What is the Brown engineering scene like? The social scene?,AmericanElms,"I can‚Äôt speak to engineering at Rice. However, what I can say about Brown engineering is that it is more collaborative than a lot of programs, which I think stems from Brown‚Äôs culture more broadly. Socially, the engineers are very tight. We spend so much time working with each other on problem sets that it makes sense we would become friends. While engineering is one of the bigger concentrations at Brown, it‚Äôs pretty tight knit (especially in the upper level courses which get much more smaller in size as people specialize more). 

I‚Äôm a junior studying materials engineering, which is one of the smaller engineering concentrations at Brown. However, I love the materials faculty, and I would say that Brown‚Äôs engineering faculty actually care about teaching more than many places where they are only concerned with research. 

Curricularly, Brown engineers take a lot of the same courses for their first two years (with the exception of biomedical engineers who begin specializing earlier). This gives you a more robust introduction to different fields than you might experience at other schools and also provides you with more opportunity to wait on deciding which type of engineering you are actually most interested in. 

I did not even realize materials engineering was a thing until taking the introductory course in it as a sophomore. Fortunately, at Brown you don‚Äôt have to declare your concentration until the end of your sophomore year. I came in thinking I would do mechanical or environmental engineering, so the fact that the requirements overlapped made it very easy for me to change my mind.

As far as CS goes I know that a Brown CS degree is very rigorous and well respected.

Any RUE transfer students here?,Runningblind,"You should try focusing on the core narrative of what it is you're trying to tell. Think of your life as a story up until this point and then think of how you see the narrative arc winding between your experiences. There's a way to bind it all together, you just have to accept you may not be able to flesh out the subplots if they detract too much. Stephen King likes to say ""Kill your darlings."" Sometimes we latch onto an idea that we adore and think is critical, but if you step back, you may recognize a new direction you can take the narrative by steering it onto a newer, more natural path that cuts more directly to the core. A key thing is not to think your story in the essay must be told sequentially. They don't need to see just how non-traditional your background is, they want to see who you are, how you've grown, why you'd fit in here, and why they should select you.

Anyone know how the study carrels work in the Rock?,christopherryates,"Hey!

Anyone know how the study carrels work in the Rock?,brownthrowaway1020,"According to the library [website](https://library.brown.edu/libweb/newtolib.php): 

"" Brown students writing a dissertation or thesis, and Brown faculty members, may apply in the Circulation office for the use of a study carrel in the Rockefeller, Sciences or Orwig Libraries. Library material may be checked out to the carrel on long-term loan, for use in the library only.**See carrel availability at:** [**http://josiah.brown.edu/search?/rCarrels**](http://josiah.brown.edu/search?/rCarrels) ""

&#x200B;

A few years ago when I wrote my senior thesis in order to get a carrel I had to submit a form that my thesis advisor signed and I was able to keep it for all of my senior year. I assume that graduate students get it for a longer time (2-3 years) since a dissertation takes longer. If you need a book that is checked out to a carrel you can just recall it like any other book that is checked out. You can get kicked out if you're sitting at their desk but as the other user stated this only really becomes an issue during finals. I used those carrels all the time prior to ""officially"" having my own. If you do use someone else's carrel do be nice and don't move their books, take out bookmarks etc. Students writing honors thesis/dissertations are probably stressed out enough as it is.

However, teaching is still part of their duties and part of how they are evaluated, and Brown in my experience places more emphasis on undergraduate teaching than, say, Columbia. 

If you are planning on going to graduate school and becoming a professional chemist, then you should pay more attention to undergraduate research opportunities. You should not expect to be spoon fed information in higher level classes. That is, you need to develop the ability to teach yourself in order to become a good scientist, which should alleviate having a bad instructor for any particular course (which is not excusing them for not caring).",2,,False,e58ip3v,False,False,1535841073.0,2018-09-01 17:31:13

How is Political Science at Brown?,that-one-redditor,"Political science concentrator about to start my third year, so I think I can answer some of these.

1. Obviously there will always be professors some people find more engaging, difficult, effective, etc., but I have never had someone who I'd call a bad professor in the department.  Regarding liberal bias, I highly recommend taking Intro to Political Thought with Gourevitch, as at some times you'll really believe he's a libertarian and at others a straight-up Marxist.  While yes, I don't think there are any proud Trump supporters on the faculty, the most anti-Trump stuff I've heard have been criticisms of his degradation of political norms, and that's usually couched as a criticism of our times in general.

2. The style of class will vary with its size.  There are‚Äîespecially in the beginning of the track‚Äîmore large lecture-style classes, but those will all have 20-person-max sections at least once a week, which I sometimes found more useful than lecture itself.  Homework is mostly writing pieces of varying lengths‚Äîsometimes you'll have a half-page response, sometimes a 15-page research paper.  I've always been able to walk into a professor's office hours with minimal wait, and if your schedule conflicts you can usually email them and they're responsive to meeting some other time.

3. I personally think the effects of S/NC (satisfactory/no credit‚ÄîBrown's term for pass/fail) are overblown, as most students in most classes are taking it for a grade.  In my experience, people reserve S/NCing for notoriously tough classes or classes they're taking entirely for fun (I've been taking German for two years S/NC because I don't really care about my grade in it‚ÄîI just want to learn the language).

4. One thing I would recommend is checking out Public Policy.  I love political science, but I have pub-pol friends who definitely enjoy the more-practical, less-theoretical aspect of the concentration.",3,,False,e4lpgp6,False,False,1534895880.0,2018-08-21 18:58:00

Open curriculum at Brown,JimmyTheCrossEyedDog,"You can't learn everything in the world.

Question about dorm,genghis24,"Everett is far from the nicest, most amenity-friendly living space on campus, but it was certainly a highlight of my freshman year. To dispel some of your worries first, Everett has quite a few common spaces (check out Arnold!), a kitchen on the 5th floor in a really nice common space, and laundry in the basement and on the first floor. I'm not sure what floor you're on, but most floors in Everett have a private bathroom in addition to the 2 communal bathrooms. Keeney is technically fully connected -- there are doors between the buildings, but they often only go one way. You can use other dorms' amenities if you really want to, but I think you'll find that doing that can be super inconvenient. 

Depending on where you are in Everett, there are some rooms that are almost fully separated, functioning as essentially two singles. I was lucky enough to have one of those rooms last year, and it made everything super nice. Even if you don't get one of the bigger rooms in Everett, though, you'll find a great sense of community and be able to connect with so many other people in and around Keeney, whether that involves going to parties or not. Keeney is also located super nicely -- it's close to Wriston (for the Ratty), the main green (for Blue Room) and there aren't too many class locations too far away. 

Basically, keep an open mind! I was super tentative about living in Everett and Keeney at first, especially that ""party dorm"" stereotype, but I've met some of my closest friends through living in Everett and that community definitely helps with that freshman year transition.",7,,False,e40p5mo,False,False,1534011425.0,2018-08-11 13:17:05
Question about dorm,r3ll1sh,"Hi! I lived on the bottom floor of Everett.

I‚Äôll try to organize my answers since I‚Äôm on mobile. 

-	There are lounges in Everett. I occasionally used the one on my floor to study or go to pregames. There‚Äôs also a bigger lounge on the 5th floor. This is on top of the big lounge (I forget its name) between Everett and Archibald which is pretty much only used for studying.
-	There is one kitchen on the 5th floor, I‚Äôve never used it but it seems nice.
-	There is laundry on the bottom floor, I was right across from it.
-	You can get to Jameson and Archibald through the hallways, though sometimes you have to go up or down a floor to do so. I went to the Keeney gym sometimes but other than that I didn‚Äôt use any ‚Äúamenities‚Äù from other dorms.
-	I think Keeney is a super great place to open up socially, though I may have been lucky. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself introverted or extroverted (somewhere in between), but I ended up becoming really close to the people on my floor, and some of us are now living together next year too.

You get a really well-designed education and will be forced to study a lot of different, important facets of applied math and computer science. You also pick up a lot of mathematical maturity along the way and generally will become smarter. 

""How rigorous is the major?""

Very. Start off freshman/sophomore year with a courseload that is lighter than you think you need. Things get heavy around midterms/finals, and you don't want to frontload your undergraduate career with a ton of math/cs courses. You'll miss out on a lot of other fun college opportunities.

""What kind of a person should major in APMA-CS?""

I think that as long as you find math and cs interesting and is willing to put in effort, you can do APMA-CS. Being good at calculations / algebra doesn't matter too much beyond the intro courses.

Yeah, midterms are done. In general I know exactly what you're talking about; in this case I'm taking courses in an intensive reading and writing honors program, as well as science and philosophy courses. The material in the non-honors curriculum isn't difficult, just time consuming, and I can't wait to take more challenging courses. Unfortunately there are a lot of course requirements here--unlike in an open curriculum--which demands a lot of fact-memorization (There's definitely a difference between memorizing facts and learning to produce and reproduce interesting ideas. Many of my required courses are focused on using the former method.)

Can any CS student talk about their experience at Brown and what incoming freshman should expect?,cant_read_captchas,"Compared to other majors, the workload tends to be a bit heavier. Honestly, I think the workload for CS will be the same no matter where you go, so using that to decide between colleges seems kind of pointless to me.

Even then, it all depends on what courses you take. The good news is that the heaviest classes won't hit you by surprise. There's only really a few that are notorious for being time-consuming: CS32 (Software engineering), CS33 (Intro Systems), CS157 (Algorithms) and CS167/9 (Operating Systems). They are well worth your time, however - my favorite CS class at Brown was CS157, because Paul Valiant puts so much personal effort into the class.

As for social life, it won't be as bad as some make it out to be. Sure, there will be nights that you'll have to sacrifice to get that project submitted on time. But if you're smart about scheduling things, it's not a barrier. For example, you want to spread out some of the courses I mentioned earlier, so that you're not taking more than one of those per semester. Some discipline also helps, ie. working on your problem sets ASAP the day they're assigned.

Regarding employment/research: there are resources available to help you find internships. For example, there's a tech career fair every recruiting season, once in the fall (this is the one you want to go to) and once in the spring. Throughout the semester, companies often come to recruit from Brown CS, because we have a ton of alumni who are employed. Maybe it was just my perception, but for how ""small"" our CS department is (in terms of the number of students majoring in CS), big companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook seem to hire a disproportionate number of people each year.

Research is pretty easy to find. You just have to not be shy. The best way is to go ask a prof for something to work on once you've taken their class. If you want to do research during the summer, Brown has a program called UTRA that awards you a stipend. If that fails, sometimes profs will fund you themselves.",11,,1491883093.0,dg3rsxf,False,False,1491880377.0,2017-04-10 22:12:57

"Visiting Brown in a few weeks, tips, advice, recommendations?",theinningclub,"> What are the places I should go that really capture what makes Brown unique?

When you're a senior at Brown, you'll _still_ be finding new answers to that question!

History:

* Visit Sayles Hall to see the beautiful architecture and [incredible pipe organ](http://today.brown.edu/articles/2009/03/organ-0). 
* Check out the the [Annmary Brown Memorial Library](http://blogdailyherald.com/2015/09/21/afternoon-annmary-brown-memorial/) (if it looks like a mausoleum, that's probably because it _is_ a mausoleum!).
* The [John Carter Brown Library](https://www.brown.edu/academics/libraries/john-carter-brown/exhibitions) has a permenant exhibition of Brown's oldest manuscripts.
* The [John Hay Library](http://library.brown.edu/hay/) has a very neat collection of tin soldiers on permenant exhibition, but did you know they _also_ have the largest public collection of vintage [gay pulp fiction](http://library.brown.edu/collections/gaypulp/desiderata.php)?
* [The best library at Brown isn't exactly _at_ Brown.](https://providenceathenaeum.org/)
* The [Rhode Island State Capitol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island_State_House) has the fourth-largest [marble dome](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Rhode_Island_State_House_ceiling_2013.jpg) in the world. The Capitol Building is open to visitors, but if you're not going to visit, at least be sure to see it from [Prospect Terrace Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_Terrace_Park), just off Brown's campus.
* Go to the [RISD museum](http://risdmuseum.org/).

Adventure:

* Go to Faunce House, our student center. [There's a walkway on the rooftop](https://www.google.com/maps/place/41%C2%B049'36.7%22N+71%C2%B024'10.8%22W/@41.8259926,-71.4031943,108a,20y,41.79t/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d41.8268611!4d-71.403) with a great view of the Main Green. The door to that walkway says ""for emergencies only"", but that [can be disregarded to no ill effect](https://i.imgur.com/mSHi8.jpg). 
* When you walk through [Wriston Quad](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wriston+Quadrangle), take a moment to marvel the thought of a complex network of highly secured tunnels connecting every building on the block to the Ratty. 
* Take the elevator to the top floor of the SciLi to get the second best view of Providence you can get on campus.

Society:

* If you're into this sort of thing, Providence is full of private clubs and secret societies. Presently, there's the [University Club](http://www.uclubprov.com/), the [Hope Club](http://www.hopeclub.com/), the Handicraft Club, the [Providence Athen√¶um](https://providenceathenaeum.org/), the [Providence Art Club](http://providenceartclub.org/) and this [odd building with an eye-shaped window](https://www.google.com/maps/place/100+Benevolent+St,+Providence,+RI+02906), to name a few.

This isn't the State of Rhode Island or Brown itself putting tampons in bathrooms. It's a student run organization. Which have completely different resources and legal requirements. 

But that's not the real problem with your argument. I'm going to call you out: had the students never decided to do this, I do not believe for a second you would be advocating publicly for tampons in public restrooms. Not because I believe you're against it, but because it would not at all be on your radar. So in that way, the students and this operation have a victory. They brought to the table of discussion a real issue. Additionally, if it really truly bothers you that there aren't tampons in all women's bathrooms, I have to bluntly ask: what are YOU doing about it? Other than complaining of course.

Tampons coming to men's rooms at Brown University,saintzozo,"Human sex, as you might learn consulting your nearest biology professor, is binary. There are some deformities and rare diseases that may make the classification ambiguous, but this is irrelevant. Nobody is making broadly-targeted health accommodations for the ~0.001% of people who suffer from persistent M√ºllerian duct syndrome. People with vastly unusual needs do not -- and in fact should not for the sake of efficiency -- expect their needs to be serviced by general-purpose efforts. Instead, they receive personalized, targeted care from specialists and carry their own medicine and other needs individually. 

The issue here is social, not biological; namely, people have a different scenario in mind: biological females who call themselves men enter a male restroom with a bleeding vagina but no tampon. This is a problem because the janitorial staff at Brown had not realized that a biological female might, for social reasons, opt to use a male restroom to tend to her bleeding vagina. These poor, uneducated workingmen had not been properly educated on the distinction between sex and gender, and that the latter is so flexible a concept that it can even be assigned at will.

So some heroes, having in mind this neglected female man, chose to stock men's rooms with tampons. They feel really good about themselves, and the world is approximately no better a place. The female man, who itself is vastly uncommon,  is saved from the minor embarrassment of having to use a women's restroom while many more important issues (in absolute terms) somehow miss the attention of these so-conscientious humanitarians at Brown.",4,,False,d7heb2m,True,False,1473542323.0,2016-09-10 16:18:43

Gender is increasingly being defined by brain connectivity and neural activity.

Some questions about incoming freshman registration for classes.,JimmyTheCrossEyedDog,"There are two things you should do:

1) Go to selfservice.brown.edu, look through the class listings and add ones you're interested in into your shopping cart. This is where you'll eventually register for classes - first-year students register the day before classes start, and your shopping cart will be saved so you can be all set to just click ""register"" the day of registration. Keep in mind that you can only be registered for 5 credits (generally equating to 5 courses) at a time, though you can have as many courses in your cart as you want. If you're not sure of what classes to take, no worries - there are several days of orientation before registration and your faculty advisor and meiklejohn will happily help.

2) Enter the First-Year Seminar (FYS) Lottery. You might have heard of these - these are small (generally <20 students) classes that only first-year's can take, and we upperclassmen are jealous of it. Most first-years take at least one. Since there are so few spots in each, the lottery is held during the summer. I'm not sure of the link or deadline, but search around the Brown page and I'm sure you'll be able to find it. If you get into one (you'll probably get something, just maybe not your first choice), you'll have a spot saved and will be able to officially register for it after you attend the first class.",1,,False,citoeij,False,False,1405014305.0,2014-07-10 12:45:05

Some questions about incoming freshman registration for classes.,JimmyTheCrossEyedDog,"What course are you referring to? While I've never taken course in the math department, I'm a bit familiar with their offerings. In general, professors will waive pre-requisites for you if you ask and explain why you feel prepared to take it*. However, if you don't feel ready for it, I suggest taking lower level courses first - you've got three more years to take these really interesting courses, so don't jump too far in and risk drowning.

That being said, you're more then encouraged to shop both the upper-level course and a lower-level course - if the upper-level one becomes too much, you can drop it while still having a normal course load for the rest of the semester, and the drop won't show up on your official transcript.

I really enjoyed Computational Statistics (APMA 1690) with Stu Geman - he's considered one of the best professors in the department because he can explain some difficult concepts very clearly. However, you'll want to have taken an intro stats course first, probably APMA 1650 which is the more mathematically-based (rather than application-based) stats course. I've also heard great things about Matt Harrison, who I'll be taking Information Theory with next semester. If you're interested in ""real math"", though, these suggestions are probably not for you =P

Unfortunately, good intro APMA (or Math, even) are hard to come by - I have not been a fan of any intro APMA professors, which is not the case for most other departments I've taken courses in. Consider taking courses taught by grad students rather than professors if that's an option - they are often much more adept at explaining concepts and are more likely to care directly about their students.

*this applies to pre-requisites, but not concentration requirements. You may be able to skip or replace a concentration requirement if you give a good reason, but it's more difficult and really depends on your advisor.

"Brown, Like Yale, Screws up on Due Process",footnote4,"The problem with this argument is that it ignores the reason we use the ""reasonable doubt"" standard in ordinary criminal law - we want to make sure that someone is guilty with a very high degree of certainty before depriving him of liberty by imprisoning him. This concern, though, just isn't applicable to situations where the worst thing that can happen to you is being expelled from an institution you don't have an inherent right to attend in the first place. When an innocent person is wrongly sent to prison, the consequences of that mistake are enormous. When an innocent person is wrongly suspended or expelled, the consequences are bad but far less severe. This makes it a lot more appropriate to use the preponderance standard in university cases. 

This article claims that Sclove chose to use the administrative process *instead of* going to the police, as if these things are equivalent. They are not. While the burden of proof is higher in the criminal justice system, if Kopin were found guilty in court, he's be sentences to years in prison. As is, he was suspended for a year--obviously this isn't a good thing for him, but it is orders of magnitude better than imprisonment. The reasonable doubt standard isn't something we just use because the crime of rape somehow demands it--we use it because the crime of rape involves imprisonment upon conviction. If there is no imprisonment, then the stakes are lower, and the preponderance standard is then permissible. Remember, if someone is found guilty under the preponderance standard, it means it is more likely that he is a rapist than that he isn't.",1,,False,chw6ka6,False,False,1401597941.0,2014-05-31 23:45:41

Transferring to Brown?,radicalpi,"A) I know who this is! Hi!

and

B) I don't have much experience with the transfer process, but here are some old threads with comments from transfer students. In terms of standing out, it seems the consensus is to focus on unique things about you rather than just general successes. Also, I know some less-recent transfers say that the transfer application process is very competitive, but I know Brown is currently trying to increase its student body size without increasing the number of freshmen, so I think it may be less competitive now than it was. You may also want to keep in mind that admissions for transfers [is need-aware](http://www.brown.edu/about/administration/financial-aid/transfer-applicants-fa-policy) if you think you might need significant financial aid.

For all my essays and shit I just focused on why I'd want to go to Brown over Reed and basically it came down to the fact that Brown has a shitload of undergrad research opportunities in the hard sciences that Reed didn't have. So I just told them I was interested in doing research. And that was my in I guess.

It's a total gamble though.

Brown Culture,Operation_Ivy,"First, I should note that your experience will vary widely based on your interests, your personality, your living situation, your freshman unit, and your extracurriculars.

 Anyway, the culture is definitely more relaxed overall. The administration is generally extremely permissive, trusting students to make the best decisions for themselves. The students are intrinsically motivated, which creates an atmosphere of cooperative competition. (Compare to Harvard or similar, where competition is cutthroat.) As for free time, you could spend your entire life in the SciLi or you could hit up the frats/bars seven days a week. It's all about who you fall in with.

One of the biggest distinguishing factors is how little people care about the varsity sports teams.

I remember chatting with a DPS officer once and this drunk guy walks by with a beer can, and he said to me, ""He should really just carry a nondescript cup, I don't care but the Providence Police might.""  RCs and CAs are not there to rat you out.  I had a friend at a SUNY tell me about getting written up by her RA for puking in her dorm bathroom.  If you get EMSd, the ""punishment"" is very minor - I think ""alcohol counseling"" which is pretty much nothing?

* Especially freshman year, when the social scene is dorm/frat parties and clubs (I guess - I didn't really drink then haha) they're not exclusive.  Major frat parties are registered with the university (we're a wet campus) and open to all students.

For example, the entrance to the tunnel to Carrie Tower (and from there to the Hay) was through a manhole on the Quiet Green. Enough people spread the word and/or got caught (and talked), and now the manhole cover is welded very securely shut. 

Four years ago, there existed an urban exploration ""club"" at Brown. Its existence was not a secret, but locations/entrances/prospects were only discussed in person at occasional meetings (at least there, it would be obvious if FacMan was present). Start this up again, or put together a book of information hidden somewhere and let word-of-mouth keep it used and up-to-date.

I encourage you all only to communicate these things with trusted (known) contacts (PM me if you want... we can meet on campus sometime) but please do not publicly list sites. ",2,,1317758215.0,c2otwu1,False,False,1317754615.0,2011-10-04 13:56:55

BROWN AID,AggravatingSubstance,"I applied ED to Brown as an international student needing aid. Brown is notorious for being incredibly difficult to get into if you are in this position. Only 15% of international students are on ANY form of financial aid at Brown (ie. receiving university scholarship). The admissions office claims they only consider financial need at the end of the process, so they try to first ""shortlist"" the strongest applicants and then admit those they can afford or have the budget for. In my experience, I applied, got in, got a totally unreasonable offer and I managed to negotiate it down to something a lot more reasonable. I think if you believe you are a very strong applicant (ie. you are what Brown wants, have VERY strong essays and grades) then go for it, because regular decision is a shitshow. In any case, getting into one of the 5 esp. HYP is so difficult anyway, especially because they are need-blind the international pools are very competitive.  And if you get accepted chances are (at any of the Ivies) you will get enough aid, I don't believe there is a big difference in offers among the 8 schools, I've heard of crappy offers across all of them none that I know of gives worse aid than the other. Idk if this helps, but you can ask me any questions you want.

I forget why, but exams were also a smaller portion of the grade than in CHEM 350. 350, on the other hand, has been really interesting so far, and the exams have been exactly what I‚Äôve studied. Since so many people find orgo challenging, there‚Äôs a lot of really good outside material to help you study (Organic Chemistry as a Second Language being my fave), which has helped me make better grades on the exams than I did in 330.

incoming freshman needs help,cats_and_wines,"Congrats on your acceptance! I know finances are a tough factor, but if I may offer my perspective as someone with most but not full financial aid (I was on the hook for ~$11000/yr),

Depending on what your concentration is, you can actually earn enough money through part time jobs and summer positions. I studied STEM. I took on loans for my first year, but after that, I earned enough to pay the 11K every year. In my first year, I worked 30+ hrs/wk at the dining service and got paid $5000 for a summer research through an REU program. Now, I admit keeping on top of academics while working such hours was difficult, but doable. From my 2nd year, I worked as a tutor and a grader, which pays more than dining service and is better for your resume. If you go off campus, you can also save a ton of money. I didn't, but instead I worked as an RPL. I also went off meal plan from my 3rd year. I spent my 2nd year summer working as a Summer@Brown RA while doing research at Brown, and my 3rd year summer at a national lab where I was paid $10K for 10 wks (my rent was $150/wk). As you can see, I increasingly earned more money every year, and by my graduation, I was already paying back the loans I got for my first year, and paid off the rest with my first real paycheck. If you are going for more comp sci, you will be making that money probably from your 1st/2nd year summers.

If you are going for more social sciences/humanities, I'm not sure how you might graduate debt free, but you still might be able graduate with less debt that it looks like now. Of course, it's totally fair if you think the financial burden is not worth it. I also had another university that gave me full ride plus extra living expenses, but the school had a reputation for being cut-throat and kind of hostile. Looking back as a graduate, I think going to Brown has been the best decision I've made in my life. Working nearly/at full time hours during school was really hard and made a challenging academics even more difficult, but at the end of the day, I would have made the same decision all over again.",6,,False,fmawx4u,False,False,1585911041.0,2020-04-03 05:50:41
incoming freshman needs help,claygup57,"People are going to explode when they see this but I'm 100% of the belief of not taking on debt when you go into a college if possible. Here are your options:

1. Exhaust all your options for fin aid at Brown and see if a job will cover it/ think  if a good internship junior year could help with 16k depending on your field
2. Check out ROTC. Obviously this is going to need to align with your personal beliefs about the military and if you meet the medical reqs, but it's a great program that'll pay for your college in exchange for service in the military depending on your branch for 4 years AD and 4 IRR or there are ways to get into the reserves (part-time) as well. I think the National guard might also help you with some money if you enlist (this is diff from ROTC)... Again, I'm not familiar with how the Army runs things as far as scholarships, but I know there are options.
3. Take out a student loan. Only do this if you are sure you're going into a high-paying career field. This means consulting, CS, investment banking, etc (you get the idea). However, if you're not planning on going into a high-paying career field,  DO NOT rack up debt.

At that point, if neither of these 3 options work for you, don't go to Brown. There's no college in the world (I know the hate is about to rain) that's worth taking on so much debt. You're screwing yourself financially and for life later on. As I said, the only time Brown MIGHT be worth it over Xavier is if you're planning to go into one of the career fields I mentioned in Option 3. Those employers do recruit here and I am not sure if they come to Xavier. Besides that, be smart financially. College really doesn't matter big picture except for a few select professions (and that's just to get the first job). Good luck and I hope you get a chance to attend Brown!

Compared to other departments, I wouldn't say it is the best or the worst funded one; all my professors had their own research going on, there was plenty of opportunity to do independent study if you wanted, and we hosted guest lectures from visiting researchers frequently. 

In all, I had some really standout professors in in the CLPS department, some of whom with I took multiple classes. I will say that my official concentration advisor dumped me on another advisor in my last semester without giving a reason (I later found out they were going on sabbatical), but that ended up being fine because I was pretty much set to graduate and I knew the other professor.

KEENEY QUAD,Nazi_Dr_Leo_Spaceman,"Keeney is fine. There are worse places to live. The only problem is it doesn't have AC, so you may want to look into getting a fan for the first few weeks of the semester. Keeney can either be good or bad depending on what you're looking for. Keeney has an active social scene, which can be a blessing on a curse depending on whether you're trying to sleep or get lit at midnight on a Tuesday. In either case, you will certainly be able to meet other people, which is nice as a first-year. Presumably, you have a double, which is frankly not ideal - but you don't have any alternatives. The doubles are quite large, so you should have space. My only advice with that is if you don't think you're going to be friends with your roommate, keep a reasonable distance so you can maintain a cooperative relationship rather than actively fighting. Shouldn't be a problem though, Brown students are rather agreeable. It's also conveniently located. Bathrooms are what you'd expect sharing with a bunch of other college students. Nonetheless, they are relatively large, and the custodial staff does an excellent job - so it could be worse. Invest in a robe to make the walk from your dorm to the shower, and a shower caddie - as you won't want to leave your toiletries in the bathroom unattended. They probably wouldn't be stolen or anything, it's just the norm to avoid clutter and keep things cleaner. Hope this helps.",5,,False,ex1bbrf,False,False,1565937807.0,2019-08-16 01:43:27

incoming grad student looking for apartment,rrrrrhey,"My partner and I live on Benefit St, and we absolutely love it. It's historic and really beautiful, and it's walkable to just about everything in providence. Depends on your budget and what you're looking for since Benefit/ College Hill tends to be the most expensive, but we have a nice 1 br with a lovely landlady, and when we split the rent it's pretty affordable ($700 each/month).

Fox point is another neighborhood that's pretty desirable- that's down south by Wickenden St, and there's usually an abundance of less expensive but still nice apartments there. It's also walkable to the campus.

&#x200B;

If you don't mind being a little further away from campus, Hope Village is another area with lots to do and its own kind of culture. You'd have to bike/take the bus/drive though, and take into account that if you drive in, parking in the college hill area isn't impossible but it's annoying. 

&#x200B;

I would say the main major neighborhood in providence to avoid is Federal Hill. It's a cool spot with some nice restaurants and you can find something pretty cheap that's beautiful inside, but the place gets pretty loud and rowdy, and everyone I know who's lived there says they don't feel safe walking there alone.

Tell me what you love about Brown,JumpingSilent,"I transferred here last fall, and I have to say, it's one of the best decisions I've ever made. Even now, in the midst of finals, I feel like brown is an academic Disneyland. To have full freedom with your studies and to work for an education--and not a transcript--is a true gift. Even for those, like me, who are not as able to enjoy everything about the open curriculum (premed, heavy concentrations, etc.) still gain a wonderful experience that I don't think you'd be able to find at another school of Brown's caliber. There are so many people here who are absolutely brilliant, talented, and kind, and I feel like I belong here more than I have anywhere else. Feel free to DM me if you have any specific questions or even if you're just nervous. Brown is an incredible place, congrats on getting in!",5,,False,en1alas,False,False,1557508181.0,2019-05-10 12:09:41

Questions from a Glutton about Brown,sea_bound,"1. Would you be on or off campus? Most people are on meal plan, at least for the first year so groceries aren't a huge deal. There's a Whole Foods in walking distance of campus but its a bit of a hike. Some people take an Uber to stop and shop or wherever for larger orders.

2. Depends on your concentration and how involved you decide to be in extra-curriculars. You can have as much or as little time as you want, within reason.

3. People love to hate on them but they're not bad. Maybe a little repetitive. You will probably end up going most to whichever is closest to your dorms or classes. Andrews it probably the campus favorite.

4. Boston is way closer and easier to get to than NYC. That being said Providence itself is an amazing food city in part because Johnson and Wales provides the city with a never ending supply of chefs and cooks.",8,,False,emk858p,False,False,1557066630.0,2019-05-05 09:30:30

Questions from a Glutton about Brown,IntingPenguin,"1. You won't have to worry about that first year because all freshmen are on the meal plan. If you want to go anyway, you can get groceries from either Whole Foods or Eastside Market, both are around a mile out from campus. I walk because I enjoy the exercise but a lot of people Uber. There's also the Jump Bikes if you think you can balance your groceries well enough.
2. Free time definitely fluctuates depending on your course load and time of year. I've had weeks where I feel like I have no work to do, and weeks where I don't sleep. I'm in CS though, so ymmv. Most people at least have a few hours free on Saturday no matter what.
3. Dining halls are average, not terrible, not great. I would say there are a few gems like Andrews curry or Jos quesadillas, but overall the food is pleasantly mediocre. A sample: [https://dining.brown.edu/](https://dining.brown.edu/)
4. Don't bother, Providence has plenty of good restaurants, starting with Thayer St which is right on campus. If you're looking for higher-end stuff downtown PVD has you covered. That being said, if you're dead set on going to a bigger city Boston is like a 1 hour trip via MBTA, $12.50 fare.

Questions from a Glutton about Brown,WheatGerm42,"1. Most people are on meal plan and don‚Äôt shop for groceries at all. For those who do, there‚Äôs a whole foods and a few other smaller grocery stores within walking distance from campus.

2. Depends. Since you have control over what classes you‚Äôre taking, you have control over how much free time you want. Some semesters I have hours of free time every day, some semesters I don‚Äôt have any at all.

3. They‚Äôre okay. The variety is decent enough that you don‚Äôt get too burned out on them, and there‚Äôs usually something good to eat at any given time. They‚Äôre definitely better than a lot of schools I‚Äôve visited, but they‚Äôre also worse than others.

4. Providence has plenty of restaurants, especially around campus. I can‚Äôt think of anyone who leaves providence just for food. That said, it‚Äôs a lot faster (and a LOT cheaper) to get to Boston. I actually go to NYC once every month or so, but train tickets can get a little pricey and it‚Äôs about a 4 hour commute.

5. It‚Äôs not supposed to be a school mascot, and it‚Äôs going down after next year (or so I‚Äôve heard).",3,,False,emkiytd,False,False,1557074929.0,2019-05-05 11:48:49
Questions from a Glutton about Brown,libbyation,"1. I get my groceries at the Aldi on Smith St. Dead cheap and you just walk down to Kennedy Plaza and then take a 10 minute bus ride. RIPTA bus is free for Brown students
2. If I'm being honest, it all blends together. A lot of my work is interesting. Some of it is relaxing. I do take off afternoons or mornings, but never a whole day.
3. I was on meal plan for three years, and after three years that was enough. It gets repetitive. Now that I'm off, I didn't realize how much time I spent standing in line. Or how much eating at the dining hall was a crutch for my social life. Compared to Columbia (where I've also eaten), the entrees are better here but the desserts are better there. 
4. Neither? Both are more expensive than Providence, plus you have to deal with logistics. Check out Federal Hill and Wickenden if you want  a nice meal off College Hill.

Questions from a Glutton about Brown,norah22,"1. Freshman year the meal plan is mandatory. After that, many people uber/walk/bike to Whole Foods or Stop and Shop. Stop and Shop is cheaper, but also further. East Side Market is also popular with people who live to the east side of campus. Those on the north side (like me) tend to go more to the two aforementioned options.
2. As much or as little as you want. Really. It depends on how difficult the classes you chose are as well as your other involvements. 
3. Average. 
4. Boston is much closer than NYC. The MBTA takes you to Boston for $11, and the trip is \~ 1 hr. Most students don't shlep to NYC often/ever.

The stress, competitive aspects of social and academic programs, the career development, and so many of the other tough aspects of life attending a competitive school do exist at Brown. Being around so many impressive people at all really elite schools makes it more dificult to be content, while living away from home, and having a tough course load.

Given all these factors, I think Brown does an amazing job of offering resources for students to counteract this struggle and embraces strategies that make college life more enjoyable.

How do I ask for recommendation letters as a first-year,theflash1011,"Haha I gotchu 


Start by walking in the door and say ""Hey professor X, I've really enjoyed your class, _____ this semester and I wanted to talk with you about how you got interested in your career path. I'm applying for X internship/job this summer and I'd love to hear about how you got into teaching/working in this field.""


This is a super basic outline of what you can say; just let the conversation build naturally. One universal truth- people love talking about themselves. Ask questions about the class, their career path, etc. and build from there. In my experience, professors are happy to provide letters of rec given that the student they're writing the letter for shows a demonstrated interest in their class. Just go into the convo with (A) an open mind and (B) some questions about the prof ready and ask for the letter at the end of the convo.

How is the sense of community at Brown?,InBlue0,"I think it depends. I myself found a lot of community, through the program house that I lived in as well as my clubs and activities and such. Most people I know had a similar experience of finding their niche(s) among people with similar interests and lifestyles. But then there are people who don't join any clubs or extracurriculars and then go on the anonymous Facebook pages to complain about not having any friends. 

So I guess the takeaway is that you can definitely find a sense of community without much difficulty, but it is something you have to seek for yourself. ",10,,False,ek8lclr,False,False,1554543555.0,2019-04-06 04:39:15
How is the sense of community at Brown?,brown3181,"This is just my opinion so other students here can feel free to push back on it, but Brown actually seems to have less of a community vibe than I envisioned before coming here. I think people here are generally respectful of others and enjoy being at Brown, but I wouldn't say there's a big overarching sense of community or school spirit. Rather, Brown is composed of many small and tight-knit communities. There's a lot of reasons for this, but I think one of the main ones is that the school is set up for people to be independent and able to pursue their own things. Because of the open curriculum, you have a lot of students who might basically only take humanities courses for four years, or only take STEM courses, and as a result they'll mainly interact with people in the same concentration as them. The same logic goes with extracurriculars, especially really time-consuming things like athletics.

Questions from visiting student,libbyation,"I go shopping at the ALDI - it's about a 10 minute bus ride away from campus. Prices are very good there, so I don't bother going to the Whole Foods unless I need something specific. If you get a university ID you'll have free RIPTA (public transit) on the card, so that'll be a big help in getting around. Market Shares is a CSA on campus and they run a summer session, so if that's you'll style you could sign up there to get seasonal veggies (they also do bread/meat/egg/dairy shares too).

Beware the summer high school students on campus. Brown does summer classes for high school kids and they live in the dorms - they'll be the largest residential population on campus over the summer.

Some places/activities to investigate for the summer: Waterfire, Farmer's Markets eveywhere, Roger Williams Park, PPAC, RISD Museum.

I don't know where they're placing you that promises apartment-style dorms since those really don't exist on campus.

They'll understand). Don't stress it, be yourself :) 

Semi-formal is fine, unless your interviewer specifies otherwise (doubt it). Unless something has caused them to drastically deviate from the last few years, you only need to bring yourself and some charisma.

On the flip side, prepare some questions about Brown, because that's one of the most forgotten parts about an interview. It's two-way communication, they'll leave time for you to ask questions too. 

Aside from that everything will probably be about you: what you're passionate about, whether it be in academics or extracurriculars or just run of the mill hobbies. I'd like to stress that this is NOT a time to repeat all of your stats; that's what the test scores and resume sent to admissions are for. The interview is more for them to get know you as a person, so this is a good time to own all of your quirks and interests proudly because they're looking for people, not test-taking robots. Mention anything that you think makes you unique and interesting, when it is appropriate during the conversation (there is a 99.99% chance they ask about what you do during your free time). Anything that you wish you had more room for on your essays is probably fair game.

It's was very common to find double concentrators, especially in overlapping fields like math and physics. Engineering students, however, had very strict and heavy course loads and it was near suicidal to do a double with engin. Not impossible though. 

My 2 cents as a math concentrator: if you go for math, unless you're going into research or teaching later, look into the applied math department instead. I stupidly let a bad freshman advisor from the applied math department scare me away from their field and into pure math and I've regretted it since. Brown had a very good department then (top ten in the country, not sure if it still is), and in general applied math is just more useful post graduation.

ETA:  I'm going to assume from your question that you're a female. I know from my math classes that in the upper level classes it wasn't uncommon to be one of only 2 or 3 out of 15 or 20 students.
