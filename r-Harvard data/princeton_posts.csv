Ford_________Prefect,"Several students have been charged with honor code violations in MAT 202 in the 2020 Spring semester at Princeton University. These charges come at a crucial time during which students are completing Dean‚Äôs date assignments and studying for final exams. Under normal circumstances, this would be a very stressful situation, but considering the current state of affairs in the nation, it can be overwhelming for every student in the course.

An anonymous post was made on Tiger Confessions in which a person claiming to be a math PHD student and a TA for MAT 202 stated that the students had been baited by a professor. A quick look into Slader.com led to a contributor account with the user name ‚ÄúArthur Dent.‚Äù This particular account had posted only four solutions. All of the four solutions were for problems from the fifth edition of Linear Algebra with Applications by Otto Bretscher, the exact book used by MAT 202. Of those four solutions, one was in the assigned problems for problem set 9, and two were in the assigned problems from problem set 10. Specifically, 8.1 #23, 8.2 #37, and 8.2 #70. The time at which the solutions were posted was provided in a correspondence email with a content director at Slader after a request was made. The solutions were posted April of 2020. Problem set 9 was due April 27th. Problem set 10 was due the following week. Further inquiry to this account led to the Slader representative indicating that the email associated to the contributor account seemed to be fake. A separate correspondence with Slader stated ‚ÄúOur moderators have confirmed that the answers given by that user were nonsense but written to look like they were reasonable.‚Äù The solutions have since been removed, however screenshots were taken and have been linked to this post.

I am a student at Princeton, and I made the poll in the MAT 202 GroupMe chat. Though I knew most students would be hesitant to participate, even a small amount of information would help shed light on what is going on. Currently, the poll stands at 9 students who claim their charges relate to problem #23 from section 8.1, one student claims their charge relates to problem #37 from section 8.2, and zero students have selected ‚Äúnone of the above.‚Äù I am not writing this message to accuse any professor of entrapping their students, what I intend to do is bring to light some peculiar information about a situation which has already raised many red flags. Cheating is not right, it reflects poorly on one‚Äôs character and negatively impacts peers who put forth an honest effort. But as detrimental as cheating may be, entrapment is just as harmful and just as dishonorable.

snoopdoggadvocate,"For far too long, Princeton University's Class Day has hosted a steady stream of academics, actors, politicians, and other people. We claim to attend an elite university, but no university can be truly inspiring, illuminating, and thought-provoking when it invites a riff-raff of normie Class Day speakers.

The previous years we've had actress Ellie Kemper, senator Cory Booker, director Baz Luhrmann, and novelist Jodi Picoult; however, none of these speakers' accomplishments are comparable to the magnificent Snoop Dogg (aka Snoop Lion).

Snoop Dogg is an iconic rapper who has changed the culture of the hip hop throughout his dynamic career. Being nominated for over 17 Grammy's (should've won 17...), selling over 35 million albums worldwide, and making hits like ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" makes Snoop Dogg more than qualified to deliver a brilliant and evocative speech to the Princeton community. Snoop Dogg's experiences are so unique that he even set the Guinness World Record for the largest paradise cocktail. Now that's a man that Princeton needs to learn from.

Be the change you want to see in the world and sign and support this petition. The voices and opinions of the Princeton undergraduate need to be heard.

TL;DR: Vote Snoop Dogg for Princeton's Class Speaker (sign the petition and like the FB page)

HolisticMyAss,"When I visited Princeton's campus I was struck by how serene it was. I imagined that if I ever ended up there, I would be extremely happy because of its beauty, and of course its brandname. 

One thing I've noticed as I've read about experiences at Princeton is that while some love it, others... don't. I've seen complaints of social stratification and people who feel very isolated amongst their peers.

I guess the thing that's most important to me is a sense of community and belonging to wherever I end up. I know that most people will definitely feel that while at Princeton, but I'm curious about the experiences of the people who don't.

So, /r/princeton, what's your experience? Are you happy? Could you tell me about people you've known who weren't happy and why? How about times when you've seen/felt exclusion or stratification?

  Today She was put on the deferred list and they want to see her mid term grades (which are looking good).

Although she was mildly disappointed, she was expecting to be rejected outright due to the huge number of great applicants, so she is OK with it.  She was also accepted to another school of ""almost"" equal choice.

That said, what are the chances, and when is the final decision usually made?

unbeforeseen,"To my knowledge fall of 2018 is Princeton's first year offering a transfer program in many years. Per the admissions site:

> We will enroll a small group of exceptionally well-prepared transfer 
> students from a range of backgrounds, and we particularly 
> encourage applications from students from low-income backgrounds, 
> community college students, and U.S. military veterans. 

As a current freshman at USC (1570 SAT, 4.0 GPA), is it worth applying, or will admission essentially be out-of-reach even for relatively well-qualified applicants? (At Harvard, only 13 out of 1400 transfer applicants were accepted last year.) I feel I can demonstrate a passion for my program of interest, which is a blend of cognitive science and philosophy, speak to several aspects of the Princeton culture and campus which make a good fit, and generally make a good case for my admission. If chances are predicted to be near-zero though--especially as I fit into none of the above groups--I'll probably apply elsewhere. 

Thanks for your advice, and I hope I have the chance to meet some of you wonderful people in the future!

JadedClassOf2019,"I apologize if this is hard to follow, but I hope you get something from this. I may respond to questions in the comments.

To any student who is still deciding between Princeton and elsewhere, I would like to give you my thoughts about Princeton and the college decision process.

I write this in part because I wish someone had told me these things when I was deciding, and also (admittedly) as a way for me to get my thoughts out of head.

I write this anonymously because I do not want people to remember me as that guy who ranted on the class of 2020 page. But if I could, this is what I would write on that page:


People will rarely tell you what is wrong with their college. You can ask, but they won't give you an honest answer. I know this because , as a prefrosh, I asked tons of current students about things they didn't like about here, and they rarely would give me a straight answer.

I have noticed that when students decide where they are attending, they gain this cult-like affinity for their college, refusing to believe other colleges could have possibly been a better choice. This is somewhat understandable, because people are generally trying to justify to themselves that they made the right choice, but on occasion it creates a fairly negative environment (like the Princeton Class of 20XY pages)

**The students on the class page are not representative of the college** 

The students on the class page are generally the more naive, outgoing people out there.

**Princeton has problems**

Upper classmen dining is socioeconomically stratified. The eating clubs are the rich and upper-middle students, independents are middle income students whose parents are making them pay through college, meal planners are generally the full-financial aid poor kids. As a kid from a poor background, this disgusts me.


**I made the wrong choice coming here**

If all financial aid were equal, I would be Harvey Mudd right now. If I attended there with the aid they offered me I would have had to go into debt, whereas here I got effectively full financial aid. I still wonder if going to HMC would have been worth the debt. Sometimes I wonder if another college that I got equal aid from would have been better as well.

**Students who do not like it here are isolated**

I have a small friend group that is connected simply by the fact that we don't love it here, and I can honestly say we all feel some level of isolation simply because we aren't apart of this group who LOVES it here.

**Yes, this campus is pretty. That doesn't matter as much as you think**

After waking up feeling like burntout shit for the fortieth night in a row, the beauty starts going over your head.


**Social life is homogenous**

If you don't find yourself attracted to either the eating club culture or the VERY specific type of ""alternative culture"" the Alternative (non-drinking) groups bring on campus, you will be hard pressed to find social situations you will strive in. 

People have gotten defensive when I simply *implied* I didn't love it here, as if me not liking it here affected them personally.


**Prestige is (mostly) meaningless**

If you would be successful here, chances are you'd be successful at a state school as well. This is with few concessions (such as jobs in finance). **You will forget what the name ""Princeton"" felt like when you got in. It will be replaced with normalcy**


**Culture is uppermiddle class here**

People act upper middle class, even if they aren't. People feel fake. People aren't directly competitive, but we *all* know we are competing for the same opportunities. However ambiguous this term is: ""fakeness"" is ubiquitous here.


**Fuck your parents**

If your parents are pressuring you to Princeton due to what it will mean for the family name, they aren't being good parents.

**Money does matter**

I feel isolated because I was poor as a kid here. Princeton DOES do a good job of making me feel well off here. They gave me a top-of-the-line laptop, an iPad, and financial aid. *I am eternally grateful for this*. But I still feel isolated. People talk about being ""broke"" because they spent too much going shopping at Sperry's. Someone once said I looked homeless behind my back because my shoes had a hole in them and I was wearing some well-worn jeans. Wealth is pervasive here.

**There is a competitive culture here, it just isn't explicit**


I could go on, but I feel like I am already rambling on. I am certain this is hard to follow but I hope it is helpful to someone.

**To conclude:** Let me be clear here-- a LOT of people do like it here, but they are generally who you are hearing from on the class of 2020 page and whatnot. My point is, the people who do not love it are generally silent because they feel isolated enough as is. I just wish I read something like this when I was deciding, so I hope this helps someone make a better choice for themselves, because it is too late for me.",A letter to deciding students.,15,0.78,4gvm4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/4gvm4e/a_letter_to_deciding_students/,9,1461900001.0,2016-04-28 22:20:01

So in 1996, Princeton was paid $750,000 by the Turkish government to hire Heath W. Lowry. He spent his 20 years at Princeton denying the Armenian genocide. The Turkish government has awarded him many grants to publish works denying that the massacres of ethnic Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks should be labeled as a genocide committed by the Turkish government. Was Amy Gutmann's (President of Princeton at the time) defense for Lowry a violation of academic ethics, or was it justified to protect the right of opposing views?

InfiniteInsaniti,"A group of friends and I dined at Salt Creek on Saturday 5/20. I made a reservation for 6 people at 6:00 and 4 of us arrived on time while the other 2 would be arriving a few minutes late. We informed the front desk that we arrived and had a reservation. They looked up my name in the system and confirmed our reservation. They then proceeded to show other guests to tables and left us standing there. We had to go back over to them and ask that we be seated. This was very odd. 

When we got seated we had a wonderful waitress who was very engaging, but who mistakenly advised my whole party that the Sangria along with other ""concoctions"" and mixed drinks were included in the happy hour at the bar that was ending at 6:30. A few of us went up to the bar to order half price sangrias for the six of us. They poured each glass and set them in front of us and then gave us the check where we noticed they were not rung up for half price. We told the bartender and she informed us that they were not included in the happy hour. We explained that we had been explicitly told by our waitress that they were included and if they were not part of the happy hour then we didnt want them. The bartender called over the manager Chad who had earlier left us standing in the lobby waiting to be seated after confirming our party had arrived. He explained again that it wasnt part of the happy hour and that there was nothing he could do so we said we didnt want them. At this point the ""right"" thing to do was to have given us the sangrias at half price because now the poured drinks were just going to go to waste and they might as well get the $6 for them instead of being out the $12 for each glass.

BUT that was not the case because Chad told the bartender to pour the glasses of Sangria back into the large tub of sangria to be served again! Right in front of us the bartender told Chad that you are not allowed to do that but he replied with ""Yes I can"" and proceeded to scoop out the ice from each glass and pour all the sangria back into the serving container to be served again! If this is going on right in front of customers then what is going on behind the scenes at this restaurant!? You CANNOT serve something to a customer and then re-serve it to another! What happened here is the same as bringing a glass of soda to a table and then serving it to another table if the customer never drank from it.

seacucumber3000,"I'm an undergraduate computer science student who'll be applying for master's programs this coming application cycle. Princeton is currently on the list of programs I'm looking at, and I wanted to get any input here about the program before applying!

I know many in CS poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons I'm happy to get into if asked, I'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

My interests in CS lie primarily in machine learning (more because I have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security. If any of you are CS graduate students involved in these fields, I'd love to know your experience with the program. If not, I'd still love to hear your thoughts. 

Princeton being Princeton, I'm a little concerned about how master's students are treated as opposed PhD students when it comes to academic mentorship and opportunities. I've also heard horror stories (not necessarily from Princeton, but from similar big-name CS schools) of PhD advisors 

For context, here are the other schools I'm looking at (and a fair warning, this list is way too long and part of the reason I'm looking for feedback is to help trim down this list): KTH, ETH Zurich, EPFL, Stanford, University of Michigan, CMU, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, Yale University, University of Wisconsin, University of British Columbia, Oxford University, Cambridge University, Harvard University, McGill University, Kings College London.",Why Princeton for a CS master's?,11,0.87,i9baz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/i9baz2/why_princeton_for_a_cs_masters/,9,1597391864.0,2020-08-14 02:57:44

meleeislife,"I was recently accepted to Princeton and had a few questions about majoring in math.

The first is about the difficulty of the major. I'll be coming in with a pretty solid background (Calc 3/Linear Algebra and a fair amount of experience with proofs) and definitely don't have an issue with hard work. That said, I'm not one of those IMO qualifying, bona fide math geniuses, and I've read some pretty depressing stuff about the type of natural talent that's required to do well in the major. I'm sure there's a knee-jerk reaction to say this isn't the case, but I'd be interested in hearing some candid opinions from people familiar with the department.

I also wanted to know how easy it is to switch from A.B. to B.S.E. Besides (theoretical) math, I'm also really interested in ORFE and CS. How hard would it be to switch to one of these majors, say, at the end of freshman year?

Discardation,"This account is a throwaway because I want to stay (relatively) anonymous right now.

Today our freshman seminar class received its final course grades. I know that several of us expected to do rather well (A or A-); as it turns out, every kid I've talked to has gotten a B or lower. Our grades break down as: 50% term paper, 30% weekly assignments, 20% class participation. Most of us earned 2 out of 2 points on the weekly assignments and participated in every class (the classroom dynamic was centered around class discussion). The grades on the paper weren't stellar but it was our expectation that our other grade components would drive up our grades. They didn't; most people earned the same grade for the paper and the class.

These things, of course, do not in themselves demonstrate injustice. Others and I aren't upset about the sheer fact that we received lower grades than we expected. But we do feel cheated for different reasons:


* One of the students, upon emailing our professor about his grade, received an email explaining that a 2/2 on a weekly assignment indicated that we were satisfying expectations for our work. She wouldn't give a specific letter grade equivalent for a 2/2, but she did indicate that she considered a student who met expectations worthy of a C, and a student who exceeded expectations in some ways worthy of a B. This was way out of line with everyone's interpretation of what a 2/2 indicated.
* The feedback most of us received on our term papers was rather opaque and when it was straightforward didn't seem to directly relate to our paper's prompt (syntactical and stylistic points/preferences). It also didn't help that we didn't have much of a precedent to work with either; the only feedback we had received all year that gave us a sense of her expectation were the weekly assignments that were very different in their nature from our term papers.
* Whatever her grading standards truly were, they didn't seem to align with the expectations one might have with a freshman seminar class. I would wager that the letter grade average and distribution in our class are significantly lower than they are in other freshman seminar classes.
* This is, I feel, is the biggest injustice of them all. Our professor demanded to us, in three separate emails, that we submit our course evaluations; before we all did this, she said, she would withhold our grades on both our term papers and course. There are definitely things to be said about the merits of reading course evaluations based on the quality of the course, but I hold that feedback has to be considered a large factor in the quality of a course. Aside from the misleading feedback on our weekly assignments, we received no feedback until after we submitted our evaluations.

Many of us are frustrated by the misleading expectations and, moreover, just bad luck in selecting our freshman seminar classes. It sucks, but I can deal with a B; that isn't the real basis of my complaint. My real complaint, however, is my inability at this point to do anything that can indicate to future students the caveats that one should realize exist before going into this course. I feel that there is something very wrong about a professor *requiring* its students to submit course evaluations before getting any legitimate feedback whatsoever; I wouldn't be surprised, in fact, if her reason for having this requirement was because she had an idea that the grades she gave out would not be in line with what a class would expect of a freshman seminar or of any class altogether. If nothing else (and I'm fine with nothing else), I just want the opportunity to either revise or withdraw our course evaluations. Is that something that you guys feel is feasible/reasonable in this situation to request? Has anyone else dealt with similar situations at this school? 

Really, I just feel I owe it to prospective students interested in the class to warn them that they will not do as well as their grades throughout the semester might indicate. I know that I have appreciated reading evaluations warning me about classes that are ""notoriously deflated"" and have selected classes in spite of this warning because I wanted to learn the subject (Arabic, I'm looking at you). However, I think it is completely fair to consider and have available for consideration, when selecting classes, what one might expect of a professor's grading standards. This opportunity was simply not given to our class, and I want to do whatever is in my power to make sure this doesn't continue.",I feel that my professor has done our class wrong.

KeepEatingBeets,"Hi all,

After careful research, I have concluded that this subreddit's banner color is not consistent with Princeton's color identity. In fact, it occupies some muddled ground in the color space between yellow, orange, gold, honey, tangerine, and carrot (see: [color shade names](https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/color-thesaurus-correct-names-of-shades/)).

According to the [Guide to Princeton University's Graphic Identity](http://trademrk.princeton.edu/secure/uisg/UniversitySG.pdf), ""Princeton Orange"" is defined as PMS 158, a spot color in the [Pantone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantone) Matching System color space. The Guide indicates that the hex equivalent to this color is [#ee7f2d](https://www.colorhexa.com/ee7f2d).

However, the [Office of Communications](https://communications.princeton.edu/guides-tools/logo-brand-assets) notes that PMS 158 is meant for use in print--paper, apparel, and sundries. On the web, Princeton uses [#e77500](https://www.colorhexa.com/e77500) on white backgrounds and [#f58025](https://www.colorhexa.com/f58025) on black backgrounds. Given the current formatting of this subreddit, the former seems to be the most appropriate choice.

Other considerations: The [2007 Princeton Athletics Identity Style Guide](http://trademrk.princeton.edu/secure/protected/AthleticsStyleGuide.pdf) defines ""Athletics Orange"" as PMS 165. However, like PMS 158, this is also meant for use in print. Additionally, ColorHexa refers to [#ff8f00](https://www.colorhexa.com/ff8f00) as Princeton Orange but this is inconsistent with the guidance provided in Princeton's own Guide to Graphic Identity.

Thank you for your time.",The color in the banner is NOT orange,10,0.83,8c30h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/8c30h0/the_color_in_the_banner_is_not_orange/,0,1523685698.0,2018-04-14 01:01:38

Also, my profile is pretty strong (perfect stats, strong essays and ECs, enough to get me into Princeton).

I‚Äôm planning on studying math in college with plans on working in either finance or tech after graduating. Based on what I‚Äôve heard, Princeton has an advantage when it comes to finance and NYC, and Stanford has an advantage when it comes to tech and Silicon Valley.

I received an email from Princeton about a week ago offering me a place on their PhD programme in Art and Archaeology. Obviously, this is MASSIVE NEWS, and I'm super duper excited, but I need a lot of practical information. This is where you guys come in! I need answers to the following questions:

1. I've been offered a stipend of just over $32,000 a year. Are graduate stipends taxable? If so, at what rate? Will the fact that I'm from the UK, which has a tax treaty with the US, have any effect on this?

2. I've been offered full health insurance by Princeton. What will this include? I have a pre-existing health condition (depression), for which I take medication. Will my insurance cover this and the cost of my medication, or will it be excluded? If it doesn't cover it, how much would a month's worth of citalopram hypobromide (20mg) cost? In case it's relevant, I'm a woman.

3. I'm visiting Princeton March 29th - April 2nd. What should I see while I'm out there? I've never been to the US before, and certainly never to Princeton. Advice veeery much appreciated!

geode_trap,"I've been accepted to the Master's program, and I have several questions about the department to ask before I accept the admission. I've tried reaching out to administrative staff and faculty, but so far all my emails/phonecalls to the department have been ignored. So I'll ask here.

0. **Does the department view Master's students as ""second-hand"" compared to the Ph.D. students?** There seem to be tons of resources for Ph.D. students (and Post-Docs), and I hear only good things about the program, but I've heard nothing about the perspective from a Master's program.

0. **Is research an option for Master's students?** I've been offered funding through a teaching assistantship, but I'm far more interested in research. The website seems to imply that research assistantship is reserved for Ph.D. and Post-Doc students.

0. **How social is the department?** I know this is a very broad and speculative question, but I'm generally interested in what kinds of events or social circles emerge within the department. For example, my current department has a very active social community in the grad program which plans picnics, movie showings, trivia nights, etc.

0. **What kind of resources are available to graduate students?** Another hard to answer question, but it's inspired by my current institution's strong student union. We have a student-run organization that is dedicated to advertising and fighting for TA and RA employment rights. I vaguely recall someone mentioning that the last time people at Princeton tried starting a union, the administration shut it down. I'm just looking for any comments related to this kind of resource.

0. **How is the political climate on/around campus?** I'm coming from a strongly liberal university located near a strongly conservative government institution. I appreciate the diversity of opinions in this area, and I love the many opportunities to be involved in political discussions.

jedifan6,"Hi! My name is Alex, and I am a teacher in Atlanta, GA. A little over 10 years ago while I was in high school, I started a project called The Freedom Cards. The project asks the question ""what does freedom mean to you?"" and participates write their answers on 3x5 index cards. Over 700 notable people have filled out cards from Nancy Pelosi to Jon Hamm.

This summer we are going on tour to all lower 48 states and finding people along the way to complete freedom cards.
On June 1st, we will be at Princeton between 9AM - 10AM and would like to meet with a few people at Princeton. The cool thing is we can meet you anywhere at Princeton and anyone can do a card.

Here is our website: [The Freedom Cards](https://thefreedomcards.com)

This course covers 13.1 miles of Princeton, starting off by the library on Paul Robeson Place, and then traveling out to the Princeton Battlefield, through the Institute Woods, through some neighborhoods before **crossing the Princeton campus by traveling along Faculty Road and up Washington Road**. From there, the course goes around Westminster Choir College, out to the Herrontown Woods, and back into downtown.

If you have any questions about the race, let us know! This is the first year that the race does not fall over the break, so we hope to have as many students, faculty, and staff from PU as possible!

NeonSeal,"Just wanted to say that I am beyond excited to be accepted to Princeton, and I'm almost positive that is where I will be next year. However, I did have some questions regarding the school:

* What is the culture like there? I know the kids must be academically driven, but do they get much down time? Is the social scene lively, or does it seem cutthroat?

* How easy is it to work with the administration? Are they strict with what they allow, in terms of creation of clubs or just everything in general? Does it seem like the adm. is a bureaucracy laying down red tape all the time?

* I know there is a policy of grade deflation at Princeton. Is this a big deal to students? Does it hinder acceptances to professional programs (particularly law or business) at other schools?

* Finally, how is the food there? I know it is a minor detail, but if I am going to live somewhere for four years, I'd like the food to be bearable.

This isn't a post about whether I can get into Princeton, or why I should choose it (I know I'd be eternally grateful just to get in) but is Princeton right enough for me to spend so much time thinking about it vs other schools.

Stereotypes have given me a little hesitance about Princeton, despite how silly they might me. So I guess my questions just are -What is the atmosphere? Are there ways to balance academic rigor with fun campus life? Are you having fun?  Is it very elitist, pretentious? Does the competitive atmosphere create a kind of ""Where fun goes to die"" like UChicago? How preppy is it? Do you feel like you can be yourself? Most of all, do you like it? Obviously  you don't have to answer each of these individually, but I just kind of want general thoughts on Princeton outside of the basic academics.

Once again, this isn't a ""convince me to go to Princeton"", because getting into Princeton is my privilege not theirs.

Porky799,"Hi, so I recently was admitted off of the waitlist and now have a week to decide between Princeton and Cornell (where I am currently committed). However I have a few questions:

1) As a prospective premed student, the majors seem a little limited compared to Cornell, for example EEB or Molecular Bio. Will this affect me in any significant way?

2) The idea of a thesis seems intimidating yet cool at the same time. How helpful were the faculty in helping write the thesis and overall how difficult is it?

3) A lot of people are telling me to not come here because it is ""preppy."" Understanding that this is mostly a myth, how easy is it for your average middle-class student to fit in?

4) This question is about the grading system: How does it work exactly? And does the attempt to curb inflation help or hinder students?

5) How are the opportunities for extracurriculars like research or volunteering on and off campus? Given the relative proximity to NYC compared to Cornell, how feasible is it to do something in NYC on weekends perhaps?

6) What are your opinions on the dorming system?

Kimba_the_White_Lion,"Although I doubt we'll get even 10 pfrosh (prefrosh? I forget) on reddit, here's how i think this will work.

1) A number of redditors (current students or alumni) say they are willing to chat with pfrosh.

2) pfrosh look at list of usernames and PM redditors asking to chat

3) pfrosh and predditors chat

4) pfrosh come to Princeton

For those asking ""Why doesn't admissions do this?"" I've already asked them.  Since they don't have 100% control over what is said (unlike on the admitted students blog where they can remove anything), they don't want to do any chat over the internet.  This is unfortunate for admitted students who would like to chat with current students but can't make Princeton Preview.  

Why Skype?  It is much more fast paced than reddit's messaging system and you can express emotion and enthusiasm clearly where it is hard to through test.  If you don't have a skype account, AIM or any other messager could work just as easily.

Anyways, who would be willing to chat with pfrosh over the internet?

Harq,"Hey Princetonians! I am a rising freshman who hopes to study computer science, and I would really appreciate some help with course selection. Although the student course guide is nice, there are almost no recent review for most classes, and the ones that are there make all of the engineering requirements sound like pure misery.


I plan on skipping out of chemistry, and, since I am a fairly competent programmer, placing into COS 217. I also have my writing seminar in the fall, and although I would love to take a freshman seminar, I am not sure that I can handle 5 courses right off the bat. On a related note, are there any seminars / professors I should really try to get (I am a fairly mediocre writer on the whole)?
With regards to the math and physics classes, should I take more than 201/202 and 103/104? How is the EGR integrated sequence? I would love to take PHY 105/106 and MAT 215/217 since they just seem more interesting, but I am unsure of my ability to do even reasonably well in them.

MasonBo_90,"Hello, all

I'm interested in learning more about graduate life at Princeton University for those who chose to pursue a Ph.D. in Operations Research. 

Regarding pre-requisites, what is the required background you must have? I know this varies from university to university, but some schools, like Columbia, require Real Analysis, a class Engineers usually don't take. If a student lacks knowledge on a particular area, does Princeton give the student some time to catch up? For someone whose undergraduate education was in Engineering, how much ""catching up"" in advanced mathematics is there to be done? 

How many classes are you obligated to take in your first year? What would you say about the workload? 

Research-wise, is there an area that attracts the interest of more professors and students, or a specific area the school is known for? (I'm really interested in the research carried out by the PENSA group). 

Finally, I know some schools will only accept students into their Ph.D. programs if they can fully fund the students. Is that the case for  Princeton?

cartesiancategory,"Hey y'all,

I'm going to be a grad student at Pton in the fall, but I kind of wanted to gauge the culture before going so I knew what to expect. The place I did my undergrad in was located in a college-town where the 70s culture never really left. There are a lot of hippie-dippie leanings and the town is small, inclusive, and definitely focused on the arts/entertainment at large (outside of the university).

I know that Princeton is also a college-town, but I've heard that it's definitely more ""old money"" and Gatsby-esque in some ways. I've never really seen income disparity at my undergrad school, but I've heard that the spectrum is a little more visible at Princeton. Can anyone speak to this?

Also, I'm sure that there is definitely some aspect of fiscal conservatism at Princeton (I grew up a few towns over, I know what it's like), but is Princeton socially-liberal? I'm not expecting the same kind of hippie-freedom that my undergrad school's town had, but it would be comforting to know that Princeton culture isn't too judgmental. I know that art and entertainment play a big role in the culture there, too, but it feels more ""prestige-driven"", as it were, as opposed to art for arts sake? Idk how to explain it. Maybe if y'all came to where I go to undergrad you'd see what I meant, haha.

Anyway, please forgive me if I'm misinformed!

Clightfield,"I believe I will enter engineering, and the website says:
> We look closely at the math and science background of students interested in the B.S.E. program, and we consider every applicant‚Äôs abilities across the academic subjects. Princeton engineering students choose a field of concentration (major) after one year and liberal-arts students after two years. More than 70 percent of our undergraduates are majoring in fields different from those they indicated when they applied.

So should I leave it as undecided if I don't have a ton of background in math and science? If I had competitions or teams in my school, I truly would have been a part of them, but my rural South Dakota school just didn't have much for STEM activities or clubs besides one math contest each year (which I did every year).

Kimba_the_White_Lion,"Hey predditors,

If you didn't know, around 85% of all the OA trips got EVACed due to rain.  ~~I'm chilling right now in a hotel in Williamsport, PA.  I'll write out a full account of how my week went when I get back to Princeton, so you'll have to wait for now.~~

So let's hear how your OA trips went.  If your trip wasn't EVACed, let's hear about that one too.

**Word of caution:** don't talk bad about anybody on your trip, They might read it and be upset.  This is supposed to be stories about the weather.  

**Day 1:**

We got dropped off, had lunch, played games, and hiked 2 miles to our campsite, no problems.  We set the bear bags, put up the tarp and had dinner, no problems.  When we started packing up the food to put into the bear bags was when the fun started.  

It started raining so everyone put on their raincoats and continued working on packing the stuff sacks.  Soon lightning flashes could be seen and thunder could be heard.  When the thunder followed the flashes by less than 30 seconds, we started to discuss lightning protocol.  Lightning protocol says that you must split the group up into 2 mini-groups and separate them while you sit in lightning position (legs not crossed and arms not touching your legs.  This is so if lightning strikes the ground, then the electricity can go up your butt and out your legs which are in contact with the floor without reaching your heart).  This was so if one group got struck by lightning, then the other can run over and start performing CPR.

When the thunder followed in under 15 seconds, I wanted to get everybody under the tarp, but my coleader wanted to split up the groups like protocol said.  I didn't want anyone to get extremely soaked, so we debated this while the sky opened up and it started to pour.  My other co-leader started to crouch as the freshmen were waiting for us to tell them what to do.  

BOOM!!!! A lightning bolt struck maybe 400 yards from our campsite.  I dove under the tarp and my co-leader got knocked over.  I started calling everyone under the tarp and conceded my debate to keep everyone in one group under the tarp.  Two frosh, my co-leader, and I waited for an hour and a half in the pouring rain 300 feet from our campsite in the pouring rain.  We couldn't stop laughing as we were pouring waterfalls out of our shoes when we took them off.

[](/c22 ""Giggle at the ghosties"") 

When it was safe to move, we went back to the tarp (it's still raining) and there was a puddle over half of the tarp that sleeping bags were floating in.  The group went to do the bear bags while two frosh and I cleared the water off of the tarp.  Everything in there was soaked.

The night was long, because every flash in the sky would be followed by my co-leaders and I counting out loud to see if it was close enough (15 seconds) that we'd have to do lightning protocol again.  We did have to do it again, so a couple more people were out in the rain for a bit.  Finally, everybody took off their wet clothes and tried to fall asleep.

**Day 2:**

It rained all morning until about 9am.  Everything was muddy and wet and we all put on our only pair of dry clothes.  Hiking went well until our support drop never came.  We needed trash bags and a new chicken and waited two hours for the van to arrive.  It never did; apparently Loyalsock lost a bridge in hurrican Irene and the van couldn't get to the meeting point.  Soon it started raining, but it wasn't too bad and we could manage it.  It started to pour again as we hiked up this tough uphill portion of the trail, soaking everything but our socks and boots.  Not for long though, we had two stream crossings.  Knee deep water in the streams, soaked our boots with freezing cold water and killed the last of our dry clothes.  

8 miles later, we made it to camp. Our campsite was situated next to a river and right in front of a waterfall that was blowing cool misty air over the campsite the entire time.  I was personally hoping to evac the group, at least to get clean clothes because everything that was going on was just ridiculous.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that we couldn't get in touch with Command at all because there was no service in the valley we were in.  To add to the ridiculousness, our campsite had a lake in the middle of where our tarp was supposed to be.  We had to make the tarp 2/3s the size and created a dam of rocks to stop the puddle from flooded the tarp if the thunderstorm coming that night were to make it bigger.  This campsite was also in a valley, so to trowel you had to climb up a 50 degree incline at least 200 feet.  There were no bear bagging trees around and the entire site was covered in mud.

The last bit of trail to the campsite was a 12 foot ladder that we had to walk down.  We didn't let frosh walk down with their packs so I had to climb up and take packs down one by one and then let the freshmen come down on their own.  This one pack which had a pack cover covering 75% of the pack got away from someone and tumbled into the river, landing uncovered side down.  

We decided to cook veggie chili that night to raise morale, and our lighters stopped working after we got one stove lit.  Therefore, we couldn't add quinua (or however you spell it) to the chili.  Everyone was cold, I had a really tough time changing socks (from soaking wet pair to really wet pair) because I was shivering so much.  A frosh's sleeping bag was so soaked that two people had to share one, and everyone went to sleep.  It was hard for me cause I was sleeping on a couple rocks and counting lightning flashes again.  Luckily, we didn't go into lightning protocol because we couldn't hear the thunder over the roar of the waterfall.

**Day 3:**
 
It was still raining when we woke up and to lift up freshmen spirits we wanted to make hot chocolate.  Unfortunately our lighters didn't work. Luckily we had waterproof matches!  They weren't as waterproof as advertised.  One cold breakfast later we put back on all our freezing cold wet clothes and headed on out.  My co-leaders and I decided we wanted to maybe evac our group to prevent hypothermia.  When we met the support van, they said something along the lines of, ""okay, we're going to a hotel.  We got all the other groups yesterday except for yours."" We were thrilled and pissed.  I later learned that my frosh were planning to kidnap one of the leaders at knife-point and demand that they be evaced back to Princeton.
 
They took us to the Days Inn in Williamsport, right next to the Little League World Series field.  As a prank I wanted to play on my frosh, I bought a watermelon and gave it to support.  I was going to sneak it into my bag and be all ""Okay guys, I've carried this the entire trip, you better enjoy it.  That didn't work out and I left it in my room.  Walking back to my room after a leader pow-wow, I see a 5 year old boycoming out of my room with my watermelon.  I say ""What are you doing with my watermelon?""  The kid looks at me, bolts into his room, and I hear him lock the door twice.

It took me a couple seconds to register what happened and I started banging on the kid's door.  A little girl opened it and I could see the thief hiding behind the door.  I say, ""Did you just steal my watermelon?"" and was met by the door being pushed shut.  I stopped it and demanded my watermelon back, to which the kid gave it back and then asked me if I had a five...  Seriously?

**Day 4:**

We finally made it back to campus and are chillin' around waiting for stuff to do.  Looks like we're joining CA.

Anyways, Google Maps has really great shots of the exterior of the building, and a wonderful 360 pic of Room 302 itself, but hardly anything of the interior leading up to Room 302. So, basically what I'm looking for is a continuous (unbroken), high-quality vid (iPhone quality, I guess) from the entrance of Frist to 302, and then maybe a second vid from 302 back down to the entrance.

I'm a high school junior and I'm interested in applying to Princeton next year. I just have one quick question for any current undergrads or alumni.

 Certain colleges \(e.g Dartmouth\) are known for being really tight\-kit while others \(e.g Columbia\) supposedly have a weaker sense of campus community. What is the community like at Princeton? Do you know a large percentage of your peers? Do people interact only with small social groups or is there campus\-wide community as well?

I visited Cornell and found it to be sort of massive and impersonal, while I loved Williams and Dartmouth. Where does Princeton fall on this spectrum? I know this is partially an issue of size but I'm particularly curious about the culture.

""Nobody cares about your GPA except grad school"" is a refrain I hear a lot, so I'm worried about whether grade deflation makes it much harder to get into grad school. 

Also, is Princeton very preprofessional? By preprofessional I don't mean ""do many people want to work on Wall Street"" but rather, is it hard to find a large subset of people who don't want to work on Wall Street?

cartesiancategory,"I was recently afforded the opportunity to matriculate to the MSE in CS graduate program at Princeton, and I'm seriously considering it. I would like to know a bit more before making my final decision. I plan on visiting the campus in March during my spring break and seeing what it's like.

I was wondering if someone (preferably current or former MSE in CS students) could tell me more about this program. I have some more specific questions below about the thesis-track version of the program:

 * What are the research opportunities like? Is it easy to continue onto a PhD (at Princeton or elsewhere) from the MSE program? I am a pretty weak student coming out of undergrad in terms of research/GPA, so I'd like to use this opportunity to showcase improved academics and a better research portfolio when I apply to PhD programs in 2 years.

 * Are you required to do research between the end of your first year and the beginning of your second year? Or did you do a tech/fintech internship instead?

 * What kind of classes did you have to take? I went to another top-10 school for undergrad, so I think a lot of the classes may be of comparable quality (e.g. we have an equivalent of COS 326 at my undergrad school with some of the same assignments, like Moogle). So I feel like I would want to take classes that I haven't already done in undergrad. Did you get to take anything interesting, or was it mostly focused on your specialization within CS?

 * Can you combine disciplines? I'm interested at the intersection of PL and computer architecture (approximate computing and new hardware/software models to support the new paradigm). Is it easy to find advisors willing to work a little out of their comfort zones to accommodate unusual interests, or are people more traditional?

 * Where did you look for housing? As it happens, I grew up around the area, so I know about the happening areas (I used to frequent Hoagie Haven back in high school). My parents live in Kendall Park (which borders Princeton and is literally off of Route 27, about 10 minutes away). I could live with them, but the stipend makes it possible for me to live on/off-campus in an apartment or something. Do y'all have any recommendations?

 * Did you come to Princeton MSE from another undergrad or did you just continue from Princeton undergrad? If you're from somewhere else, can you talk about what it is like to adjust to the Princeton academic climate?

 * Are all the MSE students close? Did you find it easy to make friends/get involved despite being possibly new to the school? Do you feel like it's easy to have fun, or is it a lot more serious than undergrad?

So sorry about all the questions! I'm really excited, and I'd like to know more about the school. I'm definitely going to visit soon and talk to professors, but I'd just like to survey the opinions of current MSE students first.",Could someone tell me more about the MSE in CS program?,6,0.81,5thet1,https://www.reddit.com/r/princeton/comments/5thet1/could_someone_tell_me_more_about_the_mse_in_cs/,9,1486874750.0,2017-02-11 22:45:50

I've never really found myself as speciically a humanities person or STEM person, although I'm thinking about being a comp lit/history major so I can develop solid writing skills and be able to understand culture better ( I definitely want to take the hum sequence). At the same time, I really want to have a deep understanding of science and the ISC course seems to provide that in a really unique way.

If I get deferred to regular decision after the results from the early action gets revealed, is there anything I can do or say to the admissions department that can help further their interest to me being a candidate for acceptance at Princeton?

curiousukulele,"Hi! I‚Äôm an UCI research assistant and I was assigned the task of understanding how major selection works in a few top colleges, one of which includes Princeton. I was wondering if you guys could help me out with a few of your opinions; it definitely doesn‚Äôt have to be objective, I‚Äôm grateful for all the information, however subjective, I can collect. I've already perused the website and statements by admission officers, but I wanted to hear from actual students, so educated guesses (or even speculation) are all appreciated!

So, here are the questions:

1. Does Princeton require you to input an intended major on your application? Can you put undeclared?
2. If Princeton does require an intended major, after you‚Äôre accepted to Princeton with that intended major, does Princeton expect you to follow through? For instance, if a student picked ‚ÄúComputer Science,‚Äù will Princeton funnel that student into an engineering department and expect him/her to take engineering courses and activities, or does Princeton really treat everyone the same way no matter what they picked for intended major (at least until they declare)? Is there a limiting of options in regards to classes, activities, etc. for certain majors, even unintentionally?
3. I saw that there was a deadline difference between A.B. and B.S.E degrees, with B.S.E degrees having an earlier declared major deadline. Do you think this affects major selection/major changes (or generally anything about majors) in any way?
4. When does Princeton expect students to declare their majors by? Can a student be truly ‚ÄúUndeclared‚Äù up until the point of declaring their majors?
5. And lastly, based on your opinion, does intended major affect admissions? A lot of colleges I‚Äôve looked into have stated publicly that the intended major does not affect admissions, but we also know diversity in ideologies (and thus major) is also important. This, of course, is a very touchy subject and I‚Äôm definitely not expecting the absolute, objective truth for this question; just wanted to hear your thoughts.

Other than these questions, if you have any other comments you could share about how students are pressured to take certain majors over others at Princeton, and any reason they would change their major: they would be appreciated!

G_E_N_I_U_S,"Hi there!
I'm currently in my first year of study ( Physics ) at a good, but not overly prestigious university in my home country. At the moment, I'm starting to develop the idea of studying at a world class school in the future. As I'm just at the beginning of my researches, there is a lot of open questions. Any help, shared knowledge and experience is highly appreciated!

As far as I know now, there's basically two ways for me to go:
1. try getting into Ivy league during my current bachelor study as a transfer student
2. try getting into Ivy league afterwards for my master studies

Am I right? Is one of those options better or worse? Why? 

Also, as I study Physics, basically MIT and Princeton are most suitable as I heard. True? Forgot one?

What really grinds my gears: What is that special ""makes you stand out"" thing you need? What makes you as an applicant get the boards interest and does not make you look like another one of thousands?

I'm sure there's a lot more to know, so please share anything you think might be interesting and helpful for me. Thanks to all of you in advance.

AndrogynousAmoeba,"Hi guys. Basically I didn't do too well in freshman and sophomore year in high school because of I was quite sick (in and out of the hospital constantly, make-shift clean-room in my room. that kind of fun stuff). Luckily I've gotten better and I'm doing better in school. Currently, I am a senior and for my junior and senior year I have a pretty good GPA (4.9/5) in heavy course load (5 semesters worth of credit in some colleges). I've decided to take a gap year and apply next year so I can show Princeton a bit more of myself. However, what I'm wondering is what direction of work do you think would be better. I'm a lib-arts guy but I enjoy math a lot so I thought maybe I could take some more advanced mathematics courses (multivariable calc or statistics) and some other courses like that. However, I'm also working on a couple of things such as a podcast I do once a week (which surprisingly a single 2 hour episode requires at least 15 hours of research, prep and editing to be decent so it's quite a bit of work). I'm also doing this internship which will be full time once school is over.

What would you recommend I focus on? I mean I can do both but obviously they'll both take a bit of a hit.

MathMajorDude,"I am a math major from a Scandinavian country. I come from a minimum-wage family, so I really do not have any money to spare. I have done my best to save up over the years, but given American education prices, it looks hopeless to study there. In particular, studying there as an undergraduate was not an option.

However, in my country, higher education is free of charge. I see that most American universities waiver the tuition fee with graduate students, in addition to let them receive some funding working as a TA.
