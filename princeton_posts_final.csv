0,"to my knowledge fall of 2018 is princeton's first year offering a transfer program in many years. per the admissions site:

> we will enroll a small group of exceptionally well-prepared transfer 
> students from a range of backgrounds, and we particularly 
> encourage applications from students from low-income backgrounds, 
> community college students, and u.s. military veterans. 

as a current freshman at usc (1570 sat, 4.0 gpa), is it worth applying, or will admission essentially be out-of-reach even for relatively well-qualified applicants? (at harvard, only 13 out of 1400 transfer applicants were accepted last year.) i feel i can demonstrate a passion for my program of interest, which is a blend of cognitive science and philosophy, speak to several aspects of the princeton culture and campus which make a good fit, and generally make a good case for my admission. if chances are predicted to be near-zero though--especially as i fit into none of the above groups--i'll probably apply elsewhere. 

thanks for your advice, and i hope i have the chance to meet some of you wonderful people in the future!

1,"i'm an undergraduate computer science student who'll be applying for master's programs this coming application cycle. princeton is currently on the list of programs i'm looking at, and i wanted to get any input here about the program before applying!

i know many in cs poo-poo the idea of getting a master's degree, but for reasons i'm happy to get into if asked, i'm 99% sure that this a master's is the right next step for me.

my interests in cs lie primarily in machine learning (more because i have research experience in the field than anything else), formal methods/logic/theory, and security. if any of you are cs graduate students involved in these fields, i'd love to know your experience with the program. if not, i'd still love to hear your thoughts. 

princeton being princeton, i'm a little concerned about how master's students are treated as opposed phd students when it comes to academic mentorship and opportunities. i've also heard horror stories (not necessarily from princeton, but from similar big-name cs schools) of phd advisors 

for context, here are the other schools i'm looking at (and a fair warning, this list is way too long and part of the reason i'm looking for feedback is to help trim down this list): kth, eth zurich, epfl, stanford, university of michigan, cmu, cornell university, university of pennsylvania, yale university, university of wisconsin, university of british columbia, oxford university, cambridge university, harvard university, mcgill university, kings college london."
2,"partnered with citadel llc and citadel securities, correlation one is hosting the world's most prestigious university level data science competition at schools such as oxford, mit, caltech, harvard, peking, and cmu.

after holding over 35 datathons in 5 countries, we are excited to announce that we are coming to princeton on september 22, 2018! 

datathons are a new type of live-action competition for data-driven, analytically minded students. they are analogous to ""hackathons"" for software engineers, but instead of building apps, contestants use real-world data to develop and substantiate solutions to a socially impactful problem. if you are curious to see what a datathon looks like, we encourage you to check out these videos from our past events:

**dublin datathon:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nqjcb8rhi&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0nqjcb8rhi&)

**2017 datathon series finale held at the new york stock exchange:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpz-bbadwje&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpz-bbadwje&)

the princeton datathon is hosted by princeton acm with citadel llc & citadel securities in partnership with correlation one. the event will take place on saturday, september 22nd from 8:00am - 6:00pm at the princeton university friend center.

highlights include:

* **$25,000 in cash prizes!**
* **the chance to showcase your skills tackling a meaningful, real-world problem!**
* **the opportunity to represent your university against other top-tier universities in the data open championship and win $100,000 in cash prizes!**
* **possible interviews with citadel & citadel securities!**

there are a limited number of spaces remaining, so we strongly suggest you to sign up as soon as possible **before the deadline this sunday, september 16th.** visit [https://www.citadel.com/careers/the-data-open/apply/](https://www.citadel.com/careers/the-data-open/apply/) and choose princeton datathon to complete the questionnaire, assessment and registration!

if you have any further questions, please direct them to [mert@correlation-one.com](mailto:mert@correlation-one.com). we look forward to receiving your application and hope to have you in attendance with us on saturday, september 22nd. "

4,"i've gone through the student blog and contacting the admissions office, but they said they can't put me in contact with anyone. are there any students, preferably from the south, that would be willing to answer a couple of questions?

edit: ok, i'll go ahead and put a few questions.

1. is it an organic process to form meaningful relationships with your professors? do any of your relationships feel forced?

2. how cutthroat is the collaborative environment? are students willing to help each other if someone needs help?

3. most of the harvard alums i have met, and even current students, seem very self-involved. is princeton a place where people are like this, or is it more self-aware?"
5,"basically, i would love to hear from former and current princeton students about the research, culture, and people of princeton, and why you think i should choose it over harvard, stanford, m.i.t., and caltech.

background:
i graduated with a bachelor's degree in biomedical sciences from texas a&amp;m university in 2011 and have been working as a research technician at ut southwestern medical center for the past year. my research background has been in designing drug delivery peptides in the lab of dr. j.p. pellois and in studying stem cell maintenance and the differentiation of their daughters in the lab of dr. michael buszczak, but what am most interested in is neural networks and synthetic biology. any thoughts and tips would be appreciated. thanks!"
6,"hello,
i’ve been accepted to princeton for the class of 2024 and deciding whether to commit or not. i applied early because of what i heard to be an extremely undergraduate-focused, no nonsense, rigorous curriculum that really prepares its students. however, i have noticed that princeton lacks name brand relative to stanford, mit, and harvard. i was hoping i could gain some perspective on how this affects both current students and alumni in finding internships, jobs, and just culturally when presenting yourself to people on a day to day basis.

thank you"
7,went to princeton vs. harvard hockey last night. who’s the big face guy in the photo in front of the band?
8,"hello, i have 3 questions 1. i really fucked up my freshman year, and i got a 3.0 gpa, with the highest gpa i can potentially get by the end of junior year is 4.0 weighted. if i do extremly well (all a's and max gpa), can i still get in 2. the path i am on for math involves me finishing with ap calc bc, with a possiblity of multivariable calc, english i am on accelerated courses, and science, i will be taking accel chem, with a possibility of ap physics if i can convince my science dean. history i am taking apwh, and will keep taking ap courses, will science be a problem since it doesnt seem to far of an advanced course.
3. will being on the chess team help and winning chess titles help as well?

thanks

ps im posting this on /r/princeton and /r/harvard as they are my 2 dream schools, i just wanna know if my dream is possible.

95th percentile on psat (99th for math) 100th percentile in high school all i can say is my high school is competative sorry for bad english it isnt my first language, i am great at speaking, i just can't write it well"
