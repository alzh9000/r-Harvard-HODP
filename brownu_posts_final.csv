[*next thread (spring 2020) →*](https://www.reddit.com/r/brownu/comments/eskthe/admissions_megathread_spring_2020/)"
3,"i'll preface this post by saying that i know that i am very fortunate to have been accepted to such selective schools. i understand that i am very privileged in my current position, but i am still experiencing some intense difficulty deciding between my current two top choices: columbia and brown.

let me give some background for the situation i currently find myself in. columbia has been my dream school for years. ever since i first began thinking about where i might want to go to college, columbia has been at the very top of my list. columbia was the first school i ever visited, and i knew immediately that it was the place i wanted to end up. taking all this into consideration, i applied ed in the fall. i was deferred, and i was devastated. i let the college admissions process affect my own self-esteem far too much, and i spiraled into a bit of depression and anxiety that made it difficult me to do schoolwork or talk to my friends. i remember walking around my house, saying things like ""if i get into any school other than columbia, i'll try to transfer after my freshman year."" i know all of the columbia promotional material by heart and can recite it essentially verbatim. i hope this shows exactly how hard my heart was set on columbia for so long.

so as you can imagine, i was ecstatic when i was fortunate enough to have been accepted to the class of 2021 during the regular decision round. i was also accepted to some other schools on march 30, including brown. up until this point, i had never visited brown's campus, and i still had my heart set on columbia, but i was pleasantly surprised to have the option.

fast forward to columbia's admitted students event: ""days on campus,"" which was held on april 9th and 10th. this was the first time that i had ever visited columbia's campus while there were undergraduate students present--the other times i had always visited over the summer months. while all of the admissions officers and student volunteers seemed friendly, i felt as though the general student body held a general disdain for the prospies on campus. this belief of mine was confirmed by looking at columbia's yik yak that day: several comments had been made along the lines of ""prefrosh should jump off a roof"" and ""all these prefrosh are making me late to class."" overall, i felt like i was not welcomed by most of students at columbia, who made it abundantly clear that i was at the very bottom of the totem pole at a major institution with little regard for your individual troubles. i experienced some of what i had only read about before, and never quite understood: the bureaucracy of columbia. after attending columbia's days on campus, i feel like the word ""bureaucracy"" seems like a perfect fit for what the administration is like. days on campus seemed like a formality, accepting the next class of students into the whirring machine of advanced higher education that would spit out our generation's pushers and movers--but little else. dean valentini (who seems like a very nice man) gave a speech, as did the dean of admissions, jessica marinaccio. i felt that the staffers and organizers were doing the best they could, but it was difficult not to feel as though the entire event and the university as a whole was somewhat impersonal.

beyond this, i wasn't entirely thrilled by the attitudes of some of the other prefrosh. sure, there were plenty of nice people there, but there were also lots of students who seemed like they were just bragging about how they were trying to choose between columbia and harvard, but would probably just end up choosing harvard. it seemed like a lot of the other people who attended the event went to private school (which isn't necessarily bad), but they brought with them a sense of prep school elitism that i had never really been exposed to before. there was an overwhelming sense of entitlement among many of the prospies that i was, quite frankly, appalled by. i have been fortunate enough in life to not experience hardship. i am thankful to have loving parents, teachers who care about me, and lots of friends who support me. yet, despite my own privilege in life, i couldn't help but feel that many of the kids at days on campus were in a different stratosphere of wealth and were far more self-assured about their right to have a place at such an elite institution. since being accepted to college, i have suffered to a certain extent from imposter syndrome, questioning whether i truly belong at such an amazing place. yet, many of the prospies that i encountered at columbia did not appear to feel similarly, and it honestly seemed like they had been afforded every blessing in life. i met kids who went to some prep schools, and had already mastered multivariable calculus and linear algebra before even entering college. as a prospective math major, i felt inferior to these students, when i myself had struggled through calculus bc. it made me question whether i wouldn't be discouraged from attempting to pursue a math degree, because i was already so far behind many of the other students.

on top of all this, i got the overwhelming sense that the student population really was as stressed as people online reported. i heard several students comparing gpas with each other, the general student did not seem overly happy. this actually reminded me of [a post from this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/applyingtocollege/comments/63mj5v/columbia_university_a_student_perspective/), which made a similar comment:

>when i see people walking around campus i don’t see much happiness or enthusiasm.

this comment seemed almost naive to me at first when i first read it a couple weeks ago. what do you honestly expect out of the student body of a top-ranked institution like columbia? people there are serious about their studies and have a new york attitude--a certain sense of independence. yet, looking around columbia's campus a few weeks ago, i realized just how accurate this sentiment really is. people there certainly seemed ambitious--i overheard many a conversation about the latest internship or job offer. yet, so few of the people i encountered seemed like they had the spark of passion in a subject that i had dreamed of. and still fewer seemed like they were actually enjoying themselves on such a beautiful april day. it reminded me of a comment i read on the columbia subreddit a couple months ago, in response to someone who posted about recently being accepted: ""get out while you still can.""

new york city, too was not what i had previously expected. i have been to new york a handful of times, always in awe of the buildings and culture there that is known the world over. however, on my most recent visit, i got the sense that i had never perceived before, of being entirely overwhelmed. i come from a very small town, where the pace is comparatively slow. yet, when i found myself rushing to the subway so i could quickly get downtown to the hectic hellhole of penn station so i could get my train back home, i felt what i imagine is the hustle and bustle of a ""new york minute."" to be honest, i didn't like it. to me, it seemed as though i was more irritable than ever before. i felt like i had a disregard for other people as i pushed past them toward my final destination. maybe it was only because i had drank a cup of coffee (something i don't often do), but i felt self-centered in a way that i was acutely aware of and did not necessarily enjoy. i had always assumed that i wanted to live in new york later in life, but i'm not certain such a stark transition would be good for me, and i'm very afraid that the climate of new york would only bring out the worst aspects of my personality, namely anxiety, stress, and a self-centered ego that makes me feel like i am the only important person in the world (i have certainly been guilty of this last one before).

enter brown. i attended their admitted students day this past week, a day on college hill (adoch for short). a day on college hill was literally the **best** three days of my entire life. it is the happiest i have ever been. all of the activities that they had us do were so much fun. from eating in the ratty to going to the bookstore to check out all the cool merchandise to exploring brown's beautiful campus, i absolutely loved it. i really cannot understate how much fun i had. i could really see myself on brown's campus for the next four years. brown had almost the exact opposite vibe of columbia. my room hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful (not that my host at columbia wasn't), and they went above and beyond to answer any questions i had. my host even took me to one of his classes, and told me about how his professor learned all of the student's names, even though it was a massive intro-level lecture. there was even an option to speak one-on-one with the admissions officer who had read your application. when i went to talk to the officer for my region, she was busy with another student, so i walked away. this lady was so nice that she e-mailed me the next day to meet up with me so that she could talk to me. she knew my name and the details of my entire application, and i felt really personally cared for. in addition, another senior admissions officer texted me personally and asked me if i had any questions and if i was enjoying my stay. when i was talking to that officer, she knew my name and exactly who i was, even though we had never spoken face-to-face before.

in addition, the students at brown seemed incredibly friendly. one student stopped in the middle of his studying to ask if i had any questions or needed any help. he then walked with me outside to show me where i needed to go. another student saw that i was confused when looking at a map and again offered to point me in the right direction. i felt welcome and cared for in a way that was 100% not the case at columbia. the sense of elitism from columbia was also not present on campus. all of the other prefrosh seemed genuinely interested in hearing each other's opinions and listening to what they were passionate about.

many other students at adoch that were choosing between columbia and brown felt much the same way as i did. i spoke to two other people who both were choosing brown over columbia. one of these people goes to the high school in the county over from mine, and was almost as dead-set on columbia as i was before attending adoch. another girl i talked to seemed surprised when i said i was considering columbia over brown: ""but everyone is so laid-back and friendly here,"" she remarked, and i must admit she had a point. my host's roommate was also super chill, and honestly one of the coolest people i've ever had the pleasure to meet in my entire life. he said that a year ago, when he was deciding on a college, he was choosing between the university of chicago (which, like columbia is known for its stress culture and poor mental health) and brown. he said he was so unbelievably happy he had chosen brown, and that all of his friends were glad they did too.

in addition, i also was convinced of the effectiveness of the open curriculum at brown, compared to columbia's core. i had always been a fan of the core curriculum, because it would give me the chance to learn about the great works that make up western civilization. i have always wanted to be well-versed in high culture, and attending columbia would allow me to achieve this. i also have been enamoured with the contemporary civilizations and literature humanities courses, where i could learn about all the philosophy without having to take formal philosophy courses. i have always loved philosophy, and columbia would offer me this sort of easy accessibility to great western works. while visiting brown, however, i was convinced that the open curriculum is not without its own merits. i am not entirely certain that i want to pursue a degree in mathematics (i also have interests in stats, computer science, and economics--though i am wary of selling out to wall street). at brown, i could perhaps pursue these interests to a greater degree, simply because i would have more time and freedom.

this all being said, there are a few problems i have with choosing brown over columbia.

i recognize that much of the reason why i am making this post is because i am still in love with columbia. i have a massive issue with confirmation bias, and i am mostly making this post because i want someone to tell me that my fears are unfounded, and that i shouldn't focus so much on the intangible aspects of choosing a college. instead, i should just be happy attending the school that has been the object of my dreams for years: ""the greatest university in the greatest city in the world.""

in addition, i am a little concerned that all of this worry over the choice of college is a manifestation of my own self-defeating tendencies. i am simply afraid that i won't be able to cut it at columbia, and so i am filling myself with doubt so that i will attend brown, where the students at the very least seem happy with their choice. there, i will still be challenged and have the smug superiority of having attended an ivy league university, but i will be in a more hospitable and accepting environment. this reflects one of the comments i heard at adoch this past week: ""think about where you want to be when you are stressed out and need help. brown provides a community... unlike some other schools."" this comment seemed specifically tailored to me.

another problem is the sense of regret. if i attend brown, i know i will regret not going to columbia, which has been my dream for years. instead of facing the stress of the big city and a major university, i know i will feel as though i simply avoided the issue instead of trying to deal with it (even though this feeling seems irrational and unfounded).

prestige is another issue. both these schools are ivies, so this literally doesn't matter, and i recognize this. still, there's something that really just gets me deep down when i can say that i was accepted to the third most selective college in the nation. i get the same feeling when i think about saying to someone later in life, ""oh, i went to school in new york"" or ""i had an ivy league education."" something about being an ivy league new yorker makes you feel on top of the world and that's a difficult emotion to give up, even if it is irrational.

i am also wary of basing my entire decision off of three days of my life. is the accepted students day really representative of what life in college is going to be like? i am so inexperienced and know so little about what it is truly like to be independent in college, that it is impossible for me to even tell. adoch was certainly fun, but is it worth changing my entire life trajectory over a single event? i don't think so, even now.

on a more concrete basis, i'm not entirely certain what to think about the pure math department at brown. while brown does have the institute for computational and experimental research in mathematics (icerm), my host said that the professors in the pure math department for undergraduates were not the best. instead, brown has a very strong focus on applied math rather than pure math. that being said, i am not certain exactly which side of math i would like to pursue. yet, i am afraid that i may be pushed closer to the applied side at brown, simply because their applied department is stronger. in contrast, my childhood hero brian greene is a professor in the math department at columbia. while i am under no illusion that i would be spending time with dr. greene, i still think it would be really awesome to attend the same college that he works at.

i am also very interested in getting involved with the radio station wherever i go to college. i absolutely love listening to npr, and both brown and columbia have had alumni go to npr (including ira glass and robert siegel, respectively). yet, the future of brown's radio station has recently been called into question, as they are considering selling it. though it does not look like the motion to sell will pass, it is something i am considering, as columbia's radio station seems to be just as strong if not stronger than brown's.

in addition, i would like to join marching band in college, especially since it was one of the activities i most enjoyed during high school. both the brown and the columbia bands are similar--they have a ""scramble"" format--but columbia's band also does orgo night, a beloved night of comedy the evening before the orgo chem final. i am interested in writing comedy and feel like this might be a good outlet for me to explore that interest. several members of the marching band at columbia even live in a suite together. perhaps this would bring me the sense of community that i so desperately desire at such a faceless institution.

to complicate matters, there's an element of this entire issue that i haven't even discussed yet. i also got into the university of pennsylvania, and now i feel like i never gave it a fair shake in this entire process. after having visited both penn and columbia before, i had decided that given a choice between the two, i would choose columbia. i was so confident in this decision that i did not even attend penn's accepted students day, and with ten days remaining before i have to commit, it seems like there is little chance that i will be able to visit any of these schools before deciding. yet, i cannot help but feel that since i seem to have misjudged both columbia and brown, could i not have done the same thing to penn? it always seemed to me that the choice between penn and columbia was obvious--a choice merely between new york and philly. both excellent institutions with similar student bodies and similar goals, just different locations. now, however, i have come to realize the importance of intangible aspects of universities at a time that seems almost too late. would i have preferred the social aspect of penn, as it is known as the social ivy? i might never know, and that is a difficult truth for me to face. i am used to having complete information when making a decision, but it appears that this simply is impossible in my current situation.

and now, let me arrive at the crux of the entire scenario i currently find myself in. the single greatest issue that is making this decision difficult for me. the main reason why i am using a throwaway account to make this post right now. i met this really cute girl while i was visiting brown.

i realize that this is the single stupidest thing ever. but we really hit it off, and i can't help but think that it made my entire visit to providence seem way better than it actually was. i don't want this to define where i go for the next four years, and i need to make sure that it won't. i have worked so hard for years, and i can't let this stupid crush change the way i live the rest of my fucking life.

so, please help me reddit. i have relied on this subreddit heavily in the past, and i need your guidance now more than ever. the agony of this decision is killing me. i would like to thank you if you made it to the end of this post, because i realize that i have rambled on for quite a bit longer than i was originally expecting. but, i felt it was important for me to parse all of my thoughts out, and it seems only fair to give you the entire background of my story.

any advice at all is appreciated."

[*← previous thread (fall 2019)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/brownu/comments/dlay38/admissions_megathread_fall_2019/)"
5,"however, i can find updated covid-19 information for [harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/coronavirus/harvard-university-wide-covid-19-testing-dashboard), [yale](https://covid19.yale.edu/yale-statistics), [princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/content/covid-19-coronavirus-information) (not a dashboard), [columbia](https://covid19.columbia.edu/), [cornell](https://covid.cornell.edu/testing/dashboard/), [dartmouth](https://news.dartmouth.edu/covid-19/academic-year-2020-21-return-campus-plan/covid-19-reporting-dashboard), ,[penn](https://wellness.upenn.edu/coronavirus/), [rice](https://coronavirus.rice.edu/), [duke](https://coronavirus.duke.edu/covid-testing/), [stanford](https://healthalerts.stanford.edu/covid-19/confirmed-cases-at-stanford/) (not a dashboard), etc. through their website.

are we supposed to read an article like [this](https://www.browndailyherald.com/2020/09/02/five-positive-covid-19-tests-among-5400-results-brown-community/) to get weekly updates or am i out of the loop? most schools (even state universities) which have some students in residence provide a dashboard for covid testing updates. maybe our cs dept. can help create one if the dashboard project isn't already in progress."
6,"i've been thinking about doing some of harvard's free online courses and was wondering whether brown has counted them towards any potential major. they do give out verified certificates. 

link: https://online-learning.harvard.edu/"
7,"not 100% sure what i want to do, but i’m going into chem and will probably end up doing pre med (or something related to medicine/drugs... probably not engineering tho)

so i’ve narrowed down options to the two schools i mentioned in the title.

i was set set on brown (accepted after being deferred), but i was shocked when i got into harvard. the thing is, i love browns laid back culture, but harvard is harvard and i can’t get past the prestige. if i decide to change my major, i don’t want to look back and regret passing up on h.

besides location and prestige, i think brown’s laid back culture would be somewhat of a better fit for me— and the open curriculum allow me some wiggle room if i decide to do something other than chem. i also come from a lower income background, and heard wealth plays a large role in the social culture at harvard which wouldn’t be good for me lol. also, apparently h professors are more focused on research than teaching? getting sidetracked but i can’t stop imaging myself passing up harvard and beating myself up for it later wondering what could’ve been."
8,"yale has harvard, usc has ucla, berkeley has stanford, but what about brown?"
9,"does anyone know if it’s possible to view your admissions file at brown? can you just request it of the admissions office? has anyone here done it before?

i’ve seen youtube videos of people doing it at like harvard and dartmouth and naturally my curiosity was sparked lol"
10,"hey. i am a rising high school junior (international). i was  trying to figure out, if  i  should  apply to brown or columbia  ed. i need a  lot of  aid. idk which of the aforementioned school has a reputation to accept international students while meeting their need. i mean if i apply to brown, should  i expect to get a really good financial aid package (given it has a higher ed acceptance rate compared to columbia)? or should i apply to one of  the 5 need-blind schools (harvard, yale, princeton, mit, and  amherst)? only 1 of 8 kids from my country who got into cornell this year, got some amount in aid. i love brown, but idk much bout their financial aid scheme."
