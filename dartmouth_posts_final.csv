0,"am i the only one who thinks dartmouth's coronavirus response was absolutely horrific? 

timeline:

- announces that students have 4 days to leave dorms, and will not be able to stay 
- the day after students have to vacate (and tuition is due), announces that students will not be returning
- prohibits students, even those still in hanover, from retrieving their belongings for any reason
- has yet to refund anyone for spring term, and provided zero assistance for students with nowhere to go or money to get there

the fact that they announced that students wouldn't be returning the literal day after evicting everyone makes it incredibly clear that the decision was ready, and they just didn't want students to panic (or to not pay spring tuition). 

sitting here as a '20, i'll have to cross the country and return to hanover after june to retrieve my belongings: which i could've taken with me and simply moved on had dartmouth announced their decision when they made it. 

unlike almost all of its peer institutions, including yale and harvard specifically), dartmouth has failed to keep dorms open for students who rely on them for housing, and has opted instead to throw hundreds of poor students onto couches, shelters, and the streets with 4 days notice. their reasoning? to ""fight the spread of coronavirus"": by sending students traveling around the globe after an outbreak instead of isolating on campus. dartmouth screwed over its students because it wanted to dodge culpability, and its response literally worsened the crisis. 

absolutely horrible crisis response by dartmouth on all levels. good thing they raised so much with the call to lead, as it is hard for me to imagine someone from the current classes choosing to donate to dartmouth after their disastrous mishandling."
1,so it looks like harvard is telling kids to just not come back after their spring break. think admin is gonna do that for us? i really don't want to stay at home...
2,hi troubled high school senior here. i was accepted into both harvard and dartmouth for mechanical engineering. i was wondering if you could give me some advice comparing their engineering programs. i really like how dartmouth sets up the program but it is kinda hard to think about paying for an extra year of college for an abet accredited degree when at harvard i could do it in 4 years instead of 5.
3,"hey everyone!

i hope that you're all doing well. 

i'm really considering to ed to dartmouth for the class of '25. i'm currently on a gap year and using this time to dig deeper into economics and history while also taking introductory psychology and cs related courses, since those interest me as well.

i really liked the advice by prof. mankiw at harvard from his blog, that don't focus on the topics of classes at college, but instead look out for good professors. economics is a subject that can be boring or super interesting as per the professor who's teaching it. 

so, my question is how have your experience been at dartmouth? are the econ classes fun and interesting? it'd be excellent if you could site examples of some fun classes at dartmouth too!"

5,how does the dartmouth student environment compare to the other ivy leagues? is the attitude more competitive like harvard or yale? or is it more laid back like brown?
6,"i am filing papers to get our organization recognized by our state at the moment, but as a rising senior who plans on eding here and expanding the organization, i would love for someone i can get in contact with that can help get my organization started at dartmouth.

there are a few executive board positions open that i would love to give to those willing to work with me.

for ethos sake, our club is seen at stanford, uc berkeley, ucla, university of washington, cornell, rice, mit, and harvard as well as 4+ high schools across the nation. i will pm the website and more information/credentials to those who are interested.

this isnt a shit or a flex post: i really love dartmouth and i can picture myself spending the next 4 or even more years of my life here. its filled with wonderful and helping people that i aspire to work with that will support my organization’s vision.

thanks for your time."
7,"hi, reddit! i applied to dartmouth regular decision and will be getting my decision this thursday, and i was interested in asking current dartmouth students about the strength of these departments/graduate placement.

i'm really interested in getting a phd in either philosopher or economics and possibly going on to teach, and i wanted to ask how strong these departments are in terms of graduate placement (especially philosophy - i've heard it's impossible to get a job unless one gets his phd from a top 10-ish philosophy grad school, which is worrying). 

dartmouth doesn't 'rank highly' in some of these fields, but i've heard a lot of that is just attributed to the undergraduate focus (research intensive grad schools inflate the ratings for larger universities), but there's not a huge amount of info on the dartmouth website about these departments, so i really don't know where i'd have the academic 'edge' for grad school.


i applied to a few other schools (the other ivies minus brown and cornell plus stanford... tbh, i was mostly interested in columbia, harvard, and dartmouth, but my parents wanted me to apply to the others), plus i got into the university of michigan honors (umich is very strong in philosophy and ranks pretty highly in economics too). i was rejected from my first choice (uchicago), and i guess i'll see on thursday where else i get in.

i've not visited dartmouth - if i get in, i think i'd have to make the trip before deciding, just because it's such a different environment (from where i currently live - urban great lakes region). but my parents used to live in hanover and they loved it there, so they're really encouraging me to go if i get in. my interviewer was really enthusiastic and told me he'd give me the best rec he'd ever given, and i indicated an interest in debating for dartmouth in college. i don't think i've got a 'great' chance of getting in (i have decent grades - a couple bs, mostly because i miss like a month of school every year for policy debate - and sats in the range - 2290 or 2300, i forget), but i'm hopeful about it. my interviewer said i ""have to get into dartmouth"" and was very excited about it, so i'm hopeful for this thursday.

also, i'm a pretty dorky kid - i don't drink and i don't like sports (i'm not like... sociopath-level aspergers or anything, but i'm not really an extrovert). do you think fitting in would be a problem? that's one of my concerns about umich (that it's rowdy potsmokers at a football game... i get the impression that the honors college is different b/c some of my friends are at umich honors reporting to me about it, but the big, state university campus kinda turns me off, even though it's an academically rigorous place). my dartmouth interviewer was joking about drinking in college and how awesome animal house was... do you find that's still the environment at dartmouth? i feel weird for asking whether or not dartmouth is ""more serious"" than that image portrays, because the students there are obviously very strong. but do you think the beerkegs drown out the academic environment at all, or do you think i'd be fine/i'd still be able to socialize normally at dartmouth?


**so... generic ""why dartmouth?"", strength of philosophy/econ departments (specifically phd level graduate placement), campus culture... and anything else you feel an incoming student should know?**

thanks so much - i'll probably update with my admissions decision come friday, assuming i'm not in a drunken, post-rejection stupor. wish me luck!"
8,"hello, snazzy title i know, but can anyone tell me what they think about my situation please?

i just got done with my interview (it was a phone call, i don’t think i have an alumni in my area), and we really connected! she has a twin, i have a twin. she was from michigan, i am from michigan. we had a good conversation, but i think i was weak at some points. it definitely wasn’t bad, i would say that i definitely showed that i loved dartmouth, but may have sounded shy. 

anyway, to my main point!

their website says interviews are from early jan to middle feb. it’s late feb though? i’m i just a “throw him a bone” candidate? a leftover? she didn’t say anything like “i think you’d be a good fit” or “you’re dartmouth material” like other dartmouth interviewers have said according to the internet. does this mean that it went poorly and i didn’t really know it?

dartmouth is my #1!!!! i hope she got the vibe, do you think these are signs that i won’t have a good interview write-up on my application? should i email her thanking her (she was absolutely wonderful)? should i continue to discuss dartmouth and how i’m currently taking an online dartmouth and harvard class (o didn’t  get the chance to tell her that). she lives in ny city and was busy. she was a little late to the call (~7 min after it was supposed to be, she said she was running late), and said she was sorry she had to go and wished she had more time to talk when we were hanging up (i suppose she was busy), so does that mean she actually thought it was good and she was short on time? 

i’m confused, sorry for the rant, do you think this will hurt/help me at all in the dartmouth admissions?

how long usually until she writes something to dartmouth? thank you😁"
