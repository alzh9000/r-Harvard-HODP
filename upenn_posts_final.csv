0,"the trump administration has agreed to rescind [rules it issued last week](https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-detail-how-foreign-students-canand-canttake-classes-at-u-s-colleges-this-fall-11594056119) governing whether international students can enroll at u.s. universities this fall, settling a lawsuit filed by harvard university and the massachusetts institute of technology in boston federal court.

the schools had asked for a temporary restraining order pausing enforcement of the policy.

at a short hearing tuesday afternoon, u.s. district judge allison d. burroughs confirmed that a settlement had been reached. she said the government would rescind the policy, withdraw an faq detailing the rule and return to the status quo of guidance issued in the spring.

u.s. immigration and customs enforcement had issued regulations earlier this month limiting foreign students’ ability to take classes online and stay in the u.s. many colleges and universities have adjusted their teaching plans for fall in light of the coronavirus pandemic, including opting for online-only courses, and the regulations have upended international students’ plans.

harvard and mit said in a court filing tuesday, before the hearing, that they and their students would face “irreparable injury” if an injunction wasn’t granted. they had also filed declarations from students who said they wouldn’t be able to participate in online instruction from their home countries, because of government restrictions or poor internet service.

1,"now that harvard, princeton, and brown all came out with much more restrictive plans for next year, will penn follow suit? it seems unlikely that they’re gonna uproot their entire plan and make a new one but with the recent spikes it seems anything is possible. 

a couple schools seem to be switching from hybrid to all online too, all in close proximity to penn."
2,"hellooooo everyone,

feeling lonely this valentine's day, or just looking to meet new people at penn? take this semi-sarcastic 20-question survey by feb. 13th, and on valentine's day *the* *algorithm* will spit out 10 penn students who you've matched with.

datamatch is a group created by harvard students in 1994. every year, they put on this matchmaking event at 27 schools, including all the ivies—and it's finally at penn! so go ahead and take 10 minutes to fill out the survey; you never know how you might find your next penn crush :)"
4,"it seems like many other colleges, oregon, berkeley, ut austin, penn state, harvard (possibly) etc... are implementing plans for a low to mid density campus. for the most part these schools are either eliminating triples and above and only allowing for singles and doubles or just prohibiting certain groups of people from coming back to campus (high risk, those that don't necessarily need to use on campus facilities such as those not in labs or doing stuff like performing arts or architecture, and unintentionally international students due to travel bans & visa complications) + encouraging people to not come back if they dont want to. it seems very likely that penn will take similar action for very obvious reasons. in one of these scenarios, mainly the former, what exactly will people be doing for housing as people living in triples and quads will be forced to break housing contracts and find housing elsewhere? will people be forced to try to find off campus housing? would it encourage more people to just do school remotely from home.

&#x200b;

also what about living in frat houses?"
5,hyp are all in someway helping offset cost due to online/hybrid semester. harvard and yale offering two tuition free classes during summer semester and princeton lowered tuition by ten percent. penn has not done either. do you feel they will follow suit? do you feel they should follow suit?
